the package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them readily available .
for more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions , refer to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or manual .
to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings extension .... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules .
this is a list of standard settings from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that possibly more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package containing &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if present , delete .
the module View Filter ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras View Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed page . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ antes , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local file system .
tree Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily recognized , can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; -@@ command can be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over View color mode , can represent either depth for the easy detection of the inter@@ oc@@ ation depth or the image of another file property such as Name , Ow@@ ner , Group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only when there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( whereby therefore display errors caused by constraints on the character of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the let@@ tering in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap representation algorithms , the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this target is not always observed .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and the avoid@@ ance of space losses in such a way that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods in this respect are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minimum shown area for an entry over the menu entry view . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the module picture gallery , a dialog box opens , allowing you to specify the image of the gallery .
the option title of this page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option Image per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File Name of the Image &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; specify whether the file names are displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the check box &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File size of the image &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; specify whether the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the check box image size , you determine if the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the Save file selection , specify where the HTML page should be stored .
you can use the check box sub@@ folder to set the sub@@ folder to which level the sub@@ folder will be included .
copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
to use the check box comments file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box sel@@ e color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nail images than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML , Settings allows you to easily access the general &amp; HTML , settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML , you will find in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media ren@@ dition for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu under Windows Navigation Pan@@ e or with short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play click on the navigation area of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser recognition adds a menu entry to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition , you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fiers for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser detection of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that deny access to this browser , change the browser recognition into one of the following options .
change the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to call with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information on the browser and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module review your &amp; CSS ; style sheets and &amp; HTML ; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W@@ 3@@ C and other standards .
check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check the menu under Extras page . you can check the following tests :
with the &amp; HTML , check whether your HTML , document the syntax of &amp; HTML is identical , all found bugs will be displayed . with this review , you can make sure that your pages are displayed correctly by all browsers .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ code ; includes quick picture editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the processing capabilities can easily be expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in the 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with significantly more metadata , such as eg &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens that can be searched for .
like all &amp; quot ; Program@@ s is also &amp; digi@@ code ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . therefore , they should report problems and improvement possibilities .
wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the bug report system . all necessary information is entered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to contact other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to take part in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to log in to the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you come to the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter path@@ names or click the Fol@@ der icon folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data collection is stored . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ code ; you will also be using as an old library .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ code ; looks at each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is altered . during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ code ; Dur@@ ing recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you can not exclude any sub@@ folders unless it is in hidden folder . this allows you to do ex@@ hal@@ bs &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ses by inser@@ ting a point in front of the sub@@ folder &apos;s name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ bian list do not have photos as icons . you can change them by using any photo from the album and disc@@ arding it on the folder symbol .
once you have configured the base folder , you can set up &amp; digi@@ tise ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
Roh@@ file support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , you can handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Menu Help Menu Support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to &amp; digi@@ kam . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transfer to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device .
Photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is meanwhile out@@ dated . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and carries out the transmission of images using g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the thumb@@ nails . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ kam , is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I Mod@@ ules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; to make K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , and digi@@ ti@@ sed ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes to &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
moving and dropping images works all over the world : you can disc@@ ard one image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ Buil@@ der , above the horizontal partition line or into another application window . the only constra@@ int is that one image cannot be dropped into keywords , data list or search .
- A file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , filtering on the file name only works if this is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ jn ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ dings or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Im@@ ported images to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you must right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a way to mark your albums so that you can group together under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos after collection from the tool@@ bar or sort View Sam@@ ples After collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections .
the album Date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums After date sort .
the oldest , average , New Year buttons : these set the date on the of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . to this end , try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first opened an album in &amp; digi@@ ede , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ jn . this should help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must select the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ code ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by recre@@ ating all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit the digi@@ code settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the range of thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails come with help window , which appears . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction into the main window shows such help window .
albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can reach all the features that have been edited with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you can choose between viewing the images , slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing using a photo by using either F@@ 4 Picture Edi@@ ting ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... in the editing section ; image editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by right @-@ clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the menu from the opening menu . to do so , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data with you when you save the altered image . as a result , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select the rotation . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you have retained the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo &amp; digi@@ code , it is moved into the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; postpon@@ ed . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete Or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift + Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ders quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the calendar view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
tags are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My Key@@ word li@@ ces ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
tags are stored in a database for fast access and assigned cue in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword , and then choose new keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , this keyword will be sub@@ stit@@ uting this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting dele@@ tion . if you delete a keyword , the photo will not be deleted itself . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ arding it . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking and editing the keyword in the keyword menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; change .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and choose from the context menu keyword .
you can select a photo with any number of key words . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made etc .
once you have a picture with key words , this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the Edit menu . the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ depend@@ able hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit .
in the bottom field you can enter a title and save your choice . this appears in the list below .
encomp@@ assing all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and in the future even more .
next he search box is a small lamp the green becomes when the search finds matches . if you click here , filtering will be deleted and all images will be shown again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box like the one described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criterion .
if you are satisfied with your choice , press OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only have to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
when you select editing , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information entered . if you select as advanced search , the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search . here , more rules are available for searching . for more information , see the Advanced Search section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu .
advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules will be added to the search group , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list with search group / search group . any option can be associated with others about the logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... You can also search for type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop every image to find a similar one . by means of a swing , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere along the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; find the right pictures . also here can be set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out or hold it and move it . move it while you move the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to open a square . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the bottom field you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ pe@@ e ; provides a lighting stand in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L The Li@@ gh@@ thouse added from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and its window opened .
from the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area you want to see . if you want to synchron@@ ize thumb@@ nails from the tool@@ bar and perform zoo or shooting operations on one of the pictures , then they are also shown on the other image .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you navigate pairs from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison . now use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it on the left . this simpli@@ fies to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , normal delete actions also work directly from the Li@@ gh@@ thouse like F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails . this makes it simple for example to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you must click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down . in the preview mode both images will show the same image area .
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . simply use the zoom control below the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode .
digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos recei@@ vable , scans or stores digital photos takes a form of digital stock management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up , find , protect and use your pictures again . we focus on the digital phot@@ ogra@@ v@@ ure procedures that &amp; digi@@ kam . we look at downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , archiving , optimi@@ zing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital asset management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , conf@@ uses and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you certainly don &apos;t use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the approach to save the metadata in a database as well as in the image files ensures very quick searches and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive , or on a network drive &amp; etc .
the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you make enough photos , then you will be using sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files do match together ? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a deriv@@ ative image .
we also recommend to use the metadata option in the edit page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ à ; to enable it . this ensures EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ? to do so , &amp; digi@@ kam , provides them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course , these are the most important ones .
now the real work begins , since you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during the further work .
let us now go with keywords , keywords , as you often call in other programs , or Categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
when you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . re@@ ordering the tree within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different met@@ a @-@ data over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are surely interested in how your photos will arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details , people , the place .
and now I say that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ ets ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after the landing . wow ! you begin to dream of having associations , memories , the historical time span is again present , you may even hear the silence . so the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others who consider your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest . if you show images you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the subject you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized Alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a label . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes in the cap@@ tion and / or title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find in another city without navigation system ? was it earth not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now running at speed of light .
the possibilities to use ge@@ olo@@ cation are inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your journeys using pictures with geographic information . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export your pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information was stored in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ tab ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the job description of the photographer . examples of this may be titles such as : employee Phot@@ ograph@@ er , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which offers the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ators can delete or change these metadata embedded in the image . this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . &amp; digi@@ kam , will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : disk failures , disk failure , current sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , recovery , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread of super@@ sti@@ tions
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper pictures or neg@@ atives .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archi@@ val quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers over gold coated DVD , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by storing good disks and good recording equipment and storing them in the correct way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sums . despite this massive protection they aging through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for faulty CDs and DVDs , there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux , but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical Media : Blu @-@ ray discs appear to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual player Blu @-@ ray Disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu @-@ ray Disc .
do not forget to copy the data back to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep their statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : flo@@ ppy study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause , S@@ MA@@ RT fails to determine these errors . some of the S@@ MA@@ RT @-@ detected errors can indicate the imminent failure . these are particularly read errors and shift counters . the expected lifetime amounts to between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems .
while most electric devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processes . these can cause severe damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause scrat@@ ched key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware ageing , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy heat absor@@ bs and the rest gro@@ unded . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as this also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system ordered . if you buy a U@@ PS you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in electricity problems with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference when considering how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
they are , however , very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a common backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1@@ GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online .
the web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup . data transmission errors are automatically cleaned up thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed memory in the offer .
the diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are prone to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing about this is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until one day you have to open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they create inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license .
Oracle created an own initiative with its tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for Linux ; it is still not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems . not@@ ebooks already account for 50 % of theft .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage than theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has not been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft , and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while technology develops further , there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard disk today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected by data loss every year . so , backup your data after a plan and test this backup before making anything dangerous as installing your operating system , replacement of disks or res@@ izing hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a bolt strikes you &apos;re lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accident : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous enough for your data .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs to your neighbor &apos;s house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said above is a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files that should be backed up . it is a snapshot of no history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . generates several sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made . this backup will be closest to a version@@ ing system except that it is t@@ anned and is not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that were really changed . this happens compressed and if you would like to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images right after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further th@@ inning should happen manually after which you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata in which image file stored IP@@ TC data , associated X@@ MP files , preserving memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year , that is about the span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to nature , you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during time . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the fewer variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available to everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist printing capability for the ability to change a system in its size .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to grow on a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted resi@@ ze / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of mature if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace the GI@@ F . it can store much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bit per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend to store your images .
TI@@ FF is widely used as a picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open file format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed due to the need to uni@@ fy the camera formats . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to using metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers now available D@@ NG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource @-@ block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits , since it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can lead to problems when linking between metadata file and image file , and as mentioned above , you should think whether you are using D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include working on architecture and modelling , discussion and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI work@@ groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for a fine editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images with &amp; digi@@ code ; edit it , you should add the metadata again . these have been trun@@ cated from the other programs under certain circumstances .
protect the edited images for copyright using a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ kam ; in addition to adding a photo to an album , you will be able to add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your database .
to use &amp; edit your digital camera ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not provide thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. will be displayed on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you might need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bar features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Ri@@ der Met@@ adata displays internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer remark , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that these metadata isn &apos;t available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ .The pictures are not deleted and we suggest you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you don &apos;t want to download all photos , you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected is gra@@ yed out until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , a new option is available . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; digi@@ anymore . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
if you are using the All or selected buttons , a dialog with which you can select the destination album appears in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is shown in the section My Albums . select the target album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you will have to select them first and then delete the selected ones .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a &amp; digi@@ - ; album before you delete them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so via the camera menu , since this is much faster .
cameras often do not use particularly meaningful names as file names . the file names are usually re@@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been taken .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this last option , you will automatically create a folder per day .
during the transfer , three more options are opened before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two relate the data about the author in the standard Aut@@ ori@@ fic section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the Ex@@ if information will be copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option , you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you want another date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the edit field . turn on the option Date &amp; Time . for more customiz@@ ations you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time .
if you are using the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you may have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in capital letters , if you prefer .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic turn is usually turned on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to disable automatic rotation , use the Advanced tab and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you have to turn this option on . use the Advanced tab and select the Date @-@ based sub @-@ verb@@ s at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , you will see where the images should be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start up@@ loading . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and lati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environ@@ ment@@ alists , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code ; users wishing to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this .
as far as we know there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS Interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; do : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude or other data , then you can use this script which works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool of Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the in@@ signia of ha@@ iry coordinates which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; change . to access these settings , you must select in the Settings menu ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be set on embedded thumb@@ nail or start image editing . you create the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ à ; fixed , if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line : this field should include the professional name of the photographer . these can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the field , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for provider : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture others &amp; quot ; offer@@ . quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC fields . this allows the metadata to be permanently contained in the image and not just in the database of &amp; digi@@ .The metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ à ; imported without going lost .
save image descriptions as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . note : for images that already contain labels , these are over@@ written by the images .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests in the main window over a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ code ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
the settings of the illuminated table from &amp; digi@@ tab can be set on this page to the default values . however , each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are switched on . however , some images have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the tool@@ bar if you are using image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with a darker or bright color in the image . these colors are set here . in image editing , this view mode can be turned on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are en@@ coded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ ance than in colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation .
using P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality as P@@ NG needs a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF @-@ images . it does not affect the image quality , since the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ less .
with los@@ s@@ less JPEG @-@ 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ less . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . as this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing .
when you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimal loss of details . this option traces the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern using the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images that are burned , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as a continuous white . use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results , since it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones . last , you may try to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the pointed @-@ lights .
this is possible because blue pixels in general do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or wh@@ ites you want .
when you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ tile ; image editing . to keep the time for the demo icing , you should proceed conservative .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ oning algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial data that comes from the color @-@ filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA intercom or color construction .
V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm that was used by D@@ cra@@ w . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result .
if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color sof@@ tening correction since it is performed during the rough conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the colour information and gives instructions like this should be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from a color space to translate into the other , so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions if an image is opened in image processing / Cre@@ ate color management module with raw files .
color profile folders Here you can set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can store all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity &amp; quot ; standard source ; for your profiles to back@@ end . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not include color @-@ t@@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ sc@@ w g@@ amma doesn &apos;t adjust for conver@@ sions at 16 @-@ bit depth . this means you have to change the color @-@ mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated .
for most cameras , it &apos;s quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not with Canon &apos;s models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . naturally , this answer is un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portraits and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will be removed from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Sh@@ ort@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper control adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes switch the metadata , respectively , which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad .
the camera features on the left hand show a list of all cameras currently supported . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in screen time mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box .
to use &amp; digi@@ ti@@ ze your digital camera , you must connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn it on .
check if &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after setting up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert all of them here .
with the option confir@@ ming dialog for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can edit the conversation from &amp; digi@@ tab ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you can find more details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editing changes by the right side@@ bar can be used tac@@ itly or digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if you use the option Modi@@ fy changes in the right side@@ bar without any feedback . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes .
you can also see the Display of the welcome screen from &amp; digi@@ tab ; disable it when starting . this may speed up the starting process from &amp; digi@@ à ; .
new or deleted albums / photos are required to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; you decide whether to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar under Settings Design . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information in this tutorial .
you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or from the context menu of preview and selection of the entry View / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . you may also find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the image editing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , displaying the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image editing changes your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image .
so you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu or using the Rest@@ ore button to restore image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save .
virtually any action of image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by editing the undo / restore function by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to undo and note C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z for recovery .
if you want to press the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing the Return or Rest@@ ore button on the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will get a contex@@ tual menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions will be revers@@ ed or restored in between .
once you have started processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , down image or entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter and zoom into the photo in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full Screen displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can also change the tool@@ bar . if you do not want this , you can change it in the dialog from &amp; digi@@ tab ; see the main window . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print image printing in the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture templates can be printed from your selection . you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export printer wizard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tab@@ s is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicking on the same tab leaves the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
in the cap@@ tion view , you can insert or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these limitations .
after you have commented on it , either use the user button or switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sor@@ tations . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC @-@ field Ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the table below :
the keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the Key@@ word tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this digi@@ code ; -@@ session used keywords .
the Key@@ word tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is another simpli@@ fication of entering keywords in a series of images . if you have typ@@ ed different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keyword ( s ) can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree . all key words of an image will be keyword in the keyword IP@@ TC keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word Filter section .
the Key@@ word Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword , and search views . if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed .
you can also select and disc@@ ard tags . suppose you have several images selected in the main view to get you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection .
in the above example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day . the Key@@ word filter is set to no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off in Settings mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or it , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can specify an advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the group@@ ing button . the options then look like this :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actually photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color@@ less workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web are similar to those of your digital dark@@ room .
if the topic is on color management , everyone wants to know what buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should make informed decisions on each point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture editions are via e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you use another color space and think about color management ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to cal@@ libr@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour gam@@ ut or not , you have to col@@ li@@ de your monitor , since s@@ RGB outputs the circle . so when you work in the color space of s@@ RGB , you must either cal@@ libr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Comp@@ ensation and Con@@ trast Tro@@ ub@@ les@@ hooting Automatic correc@@ tions try to make the best out of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the den@@ te values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est dot is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
similar : this method adju@@ sts the intensity re@@ actor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity can@@ als becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the balance has very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram range .
bro@@ aden contrast : this method enhances the contrast and illumin@@ ance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a restart of all values in @-@ between . this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted as a color space is worked with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can use the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it via the menu entry Color white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . preview is dynamically adapted to the tool settings . if you want to see the original image again , then click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamic changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful there , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your results depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or di@@ mming down .
to play a stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen color for calcul@@ ating the color temperature of the white balance . this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default setting list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator raises the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result in the white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image .
save as and load the buttons . each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it into a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original . if you save them , your original image will be changed .
8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color @-@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used to consult the color management chapter .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to also save your settings so you can use them for more photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always make the same error and therefore you will always need the same correction .
a very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed tool color effects provides you with four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , solar power , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that arose when a partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash light and afterwards the development of the picture completed . the colored , darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase finally creates a negative picture that is not to be generated on photographic paper .
this is an example of the Solar Energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet aqu@@ ire ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for a light @-@ optimized reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ oth ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the Ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repe@@ ats the strength of the ne@@ on light . for larger images , the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different colour aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors .
also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . all the changes you perform can be viewed in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple den@@ ser starch / contrast / g@@ amma the tool is set to improve exposure . even if the dialogue with this tool is very complicated , you will need only the area of the slider for the application described here . more concrete the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three slides are cli@@ cked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the control knob and watch out how the picture changes .
on the right side , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be used to indicate whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the highest for the dark tones , the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma figures .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic alignment .
exit values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the exit values can be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is visible in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons you can save the set values in the file system and rel@@ o@@ ad it later . this will use the Gim@@ p level format .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input will be automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ lay Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
the left side shows half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . the following options are available on the right @-@ hand side :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most useful . for images with large areas of constant color , linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker .
on the preview of the original photo , a red marker is visible . if you move this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it then up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ lay Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel , over@@ exposed pixels are displayed , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shade and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ pe@@ e channel mixer ; image editing is a tool for improving colour channels or changing the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the colors of the images . you can edit it from the Color Channel Mixer from the image editing menu .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the picture will retain general brightness too , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black @-@ and @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits .
sometimes , especially if you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the far@@ th@@ est . far@@ brau@@ schen is made of small room art@@ ef@@ acts that don &apos;t appear in the same place in the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case you can improve your Mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by lowering the far@@ th@@ rows first .
the storage and loading buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer settings you can save for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ lay Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result .

black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since colour images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good at all scene pictures and fits especially well with portraits towards the sky .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at day@@ time . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ thon : produces warm , bright and middle tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ aded tones . this is very similar to the process of un@@ le@@ aking a pressure and re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or the three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture in the image .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; adding tool frames can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . the picture runs through a colored line , ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ and @-@ white images ) , sh@@ kant@@ et surrounds it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a kno@@ ck effect and decor@@ atively adding an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : specify the width of the frame in percent . the range of value for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool After page ratio .
with this handy tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this is also possible in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text execution , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have selected for your text can be changed until you press the &quot; OK &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more .
with the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool templates , you can place a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the template , simply send an email in English to the template ; mailing list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your templates folder in the dialog with the Share Fol@@ der button . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder updates the preview bar of the templates automatically .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check with the left mouse button .
shrink it : this button res@@ izes the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . to do so , take the image and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically to preview size .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually , it does not sharp@@ ens a bit , it works rather psycho@@ analy@@ tically . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adjustment .
photographs without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process must combine colors with minimal differences at one color point . this in turn results in sharp edges a little bl@@ urred . SL@@ R cameras usually require more retro@@ fit than normal cameras for private users .
images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners are using a follow @-@ up filter during reading of the image . if you de@@ activate it , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing sharp@@ ness . you can call this with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting Shar@@ es .
you should use this carefully since the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also increases the noise . generally , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image is the tool re@@ focusing . you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharp@@ ness . use the tool to sof@@ ten with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft drawing and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mass@@ aging is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first . an increase in the radius or the amount intensi@@ fies the effect .
the radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of an edge . high @-@ resolution images allow for larger radi@@ i . therefore , they should be better sharpen@@ ed in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ urred image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . this allows for a minimal difference to be applied to an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mas@@ ked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . bl@@ ur@@ ry mas@@ king was applied with Radi@@ us = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focusing an image by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted design filtering algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which it revers@@ es the focus . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tr@@ . re@@ focusing mostly achieves better results than bl@@ urred .
in practice the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Vienna In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced even very strongly by the distant pixels . this causes un@@ desirable results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most of the images , the default value should result in good results .
correlation : an increase in the correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values are 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
the filter can take values from 0 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a good value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further blu@@ r the image .
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness Gau@@ ß is sch . this is most often caused by a previously executed lack of blu@@ r . in most cases , you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the g@@ auss sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stores as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focusing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before otherwise change the image . the reason for this is that many operations that are not immediately visible , but later leave un@@ desirable art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you are reading and comp@@ ressing images , eg . as a JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharp@@ ness . this might be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king uses a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Line@@ ar Filter . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better for processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp color image that has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the pad lev@@ elling stops the bl@@ ur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink ink allows a modified colour for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust it here .
the image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove un@@ desired art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ th@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values mainly smooth homo@@ geneous regions and leave details sharp . a value of 0,@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing should be added subsequently .
exposure depen@@ dency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ ths equally in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD h@@ iss will generate a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG arti@@ facts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smoo@@ ten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . so set this value appropriately to the degree of smoking in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it smoo@@ thes . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 suff@@ ices here .
angle @-@ range da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be chosen small . make sure that small angles generate a long run@@ time . so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step distance &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never greater than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the highest quality you get by choosing this option is only low . it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it out .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . correc@@ ting any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and get a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small arti@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the voyage .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be removed successfully with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needed and can blu@@ r the image .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , you may need to re @-@ adjust the edges filter if you change this setting . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or black@@ out occurs again .
this value increases the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically harder to smoke . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls adjusting the phase damp@@ ing . this value re@@ defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smoo@@ ther when it is too high . if it is on its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear on the edges .
store under and load : these buttons are used for that purpose . all noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen an image . use tool to sof@@ ten the soft character with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting soft drawing and experiment with the smoo@@ th@@ ness .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographic arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for the restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , even far from compression in some areas . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ acts ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the buttons Save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and get a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ ters .
below you can be restored like a photo with uni@@ form@@ ly noise . the module is applied on a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been reduced to an old color photograph being read by a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts created by the scanner illumination and the photographic paper . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows it to remove h@@ ind pixel from photos with a CCD camera in terms of eight have been removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built @-@ in supp@@ ress for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image right after the image capture new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant will see the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
duration : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filtering method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cub@@ ical surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool for correc@@ ting the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area evenly . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter to increase the necessary closing time in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera manually . wide angle lenses should also use an opening of f / 16 or smaller , as there would otherwise be disc@@ ur@@ ring effects caused by movement .
with the large exposure range of today &apos;s film and the gra@@ y@@ scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by applying a equivalent transformation on a rough image made without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation using a C@@ enter@@ filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection filter and adjust the exposure of the target image at three more points .
density : this parameter controls the degree of fibre damp@@ ing at the point of the highest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or by chance of a lens speed of 2 , lower it to compensate for a small degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting .
you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting Cor@@ rection applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the Vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . an adjustment and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
the &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the fourth grade coefficient adju@@ sts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value checks the distortion of the second degree . negative values can be used to correct tone @-@ shaped distortion and positive values cushion distortion .
this value is stronger on the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most of the lenses , the &apos; Corner Parameter &apos; has the reverse signi@@ fier of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus results in a correction of first degree . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
bright : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the correction of the barrel or cushion should be performed before any changes of the correction or size . the best way to do this is to correct this correction first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong one .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse poin@@ ter in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you rec@@ tify a cushion distortion , the resulting picture will have black corners . you can remove them with the Zu@@ cutting tool in the Trans@@ Gener@@ ate editing from image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as images from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method used to simulate the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra feature film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
below the preview , you can set two parameters for film gran@@ ulation and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the option Add film gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the Filter panel is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film gran@@ ules on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films like the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver gran@@ ules of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ gra@@ bbing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny look especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ filtering effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that edited the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17 .
the lines , which define the outlines in the drawing , are emphasized . images of whose gra@@ dient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to sketch you . these would be good pictures to begin with .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ code filter engra@@ ver shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the Filter engra@@ ver is a quick tool for re@@ producing your images with a 3D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important part of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , equivalent to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by blocks of glass .
shaft blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wavel@@ eng@@ ths 1 , the picture here is distorted along with another version of blocks of glass .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button shut@@ ters .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom An sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a central point . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the image by turning the pixels around a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a revol@@ ving camera .
distance bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ urred the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to go back into the background .
motion blu@@ r : bl@@ urred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera .
soft @-@ drawing bl@@ ur@@ ring : bl@@ urs the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sharp@@ ness : bl@@ urred the image by a random shift of the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent blu@@ r : finds the ink in the picture and bl@@ urs it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button shut@@ ters .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . thus , it gives natural your images a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture .
you can stick with the &amp; digi@@ tile ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning to the correct orientation . the tools for this can be found in the Transform@@ ieren Tur@@ ning and Trans@@ coding Settings menu .
infl@@ ating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
changing the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with better quality , try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below :
maintaining aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it smoo@@ thes . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons are used for this purpose . each inser@@ tion for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and move a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shut@@ ters .
you can see an example of photo infl@@ ating below by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you need to create with the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle , you will see this rect@@ angle as you move the mouse .
you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ pped by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply dra@@ gging it with the left mouse button .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The edit button of image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save in the File menu to save the newly cut photo .
in the preview section , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains unchanged .
in the tool After page relationship , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format width is always assigned .
cutting edge ratio using a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using inches , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the selected relationship and orientation .
cutting the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horizon@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the edit tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the image and not the original image .
help to set up help settings so that you can compose your pictures better . these aids include :
harmonious triangle : harmonic parti@@ tions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles at the diag@@ onal .
the golden middle : the golden middle is a division that focuses on different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is equal to 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the gold middle .
the golden centre provides more fluid guides when you put together an image . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads to the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the gold spiral mentioned above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place these lines can have a static object more dynamic .
if you are using golden tri@@ angles to break up your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles .
the Horiz@@ ont@@ ally and Ver@@ tical options can be used to reflect the harmonic parti@@ tions .
with the Color button you can set the color of the lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle .
if you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can fix this with the digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . select Trans@@ form Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have rot@@ ated an image you will find un@@ desirable tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ieren cutting from image editing .
an elegant way to cut the image is to cut the Automati@@ cally S@@ cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option fl@@ atten@@ s the picture a bit after the rotation . note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically calculated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new heights : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels .
angle left above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the picture is s@@ me@@ ared a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adapted the perspective you get un@@ pleasantly tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clear this is to cut the image with transform@@ able cutting from image processing .
the sc@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal cord , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left . this is not a rotation , the image is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
shoot your image by rotating the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit bl@@ urred . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two insul@@ ators produce twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing the image has beautiful tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transform@@ able cutting from image processing .
the available formats hang from your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats that are available on your system at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF under it .
this happens based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , the file in the image editing will be displayed . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept changes . see the configuration section for more information on this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . this reduces redundant information in order to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG for the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less if it is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can read on Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; in the configuration section you will find further information about using modules with &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; supports loading of raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ .The table below shows more than 200 file formats . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support recording short films . this clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam , understands these formats and will preview films . &amp; digi@@ kam , is not a film editor and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast is already very good , then you can perform the first four alignment with the module white balance .
many tools you need the photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; your description will follow here .
all image editing tools such as sharp@@ ness , soft character , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box to indicate the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applying quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left pane displays the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper section shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the box to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and drop it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties side@@ bar shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . this data is from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out or hold it and move it . move it while you move the left mouse button . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to open a square . all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes that are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; can be applied either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is shown in the palette view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described in the palette view . here , the colour name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box En@@ m Cur@@ sor is activated under the color button , the color will be past@@ ed from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ writing under the cur@@ sor .
a selection that was created as described in the last section , can be used along with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program that contains &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs containing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de program .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; at . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; kate ; the graph re@@ comp@@ uted and published in &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to represent more than these no@@ des )
further needed software : &amp; k@@ Graphics viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program which requires the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graphs . requires in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in its own sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file .
after you have selected one or more of the files , the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or choose this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; old ; key ) ;
zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been changed by another program , the following window will be shown :
you can choose whether the graph should be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item Settings k@@ diagra@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
if you want to open a Graph@@ end@@ at@@ ei outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; instance , in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice dur@@ ably , but also change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical parties can be selected freely .
when you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed across multiple pages without header line and with a different font
the Renew@@ al Load page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of a graph viewer ; specify a standard behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is asked .
the session management page gives you the ability to specify the starting behaviour of &amp; k@@ olo@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which appears normally by clicking in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n , opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layout algorithms . entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ lit graphs . it produces representations according to the spring spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce model layout for ung@@ u@@ arded graphs . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a Multi @-@ Grid for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the k@@ not circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms provide special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ rounded ) and applies the standard algorithm for the particular type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ lit graphs ) .
if this option is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
shows the What is the mouse cur@@ sor . click on a &amp; GUI ; button with this mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to get further help to this element ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source folder &apos;s base folder .
&amp; k@@ Graphics viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for representation . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options .
the main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid , in which you draw the symbol .
when the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that a dialog appears where you can choose whether the symbol is to be created from a template , or if you want to start anew from scratch .
restore the last revers@@ ed step . if you have not made any progress , this function is de@@ activated .
inserts the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current icon in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ;
does not change the symbol , but instead puts the current color on the color of the point you click .
the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current canvas , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
inserts the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ do edit ; set up a dialogue with the three sides templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bars .
with the buttons Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pixels or display rulers and display single @-@ color : or a chess board as a banner . you can also adjust for the chess board the size : the car@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose .
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides images and provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source like e.g. Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry images , a dialog appears which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by replacing the default values duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the scanning button . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed because some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image . here you can specify the compression and type of image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you must also select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots once you have selected in the Import &gt; screen shot menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear to allow you to view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible workplace . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been taken , the dialogue options of the target image will appear with the options already described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to share your photos with people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world , put your photos online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can register with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will see the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the ex@@ porting module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . at present , the module also does not support other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button Photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , start up@@ loading the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the keywords box can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during the upload process .
with the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options , you can set the access per@@ missions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos are changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic loc@@ alization module provides tools for loc@@ ating ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization of cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to perform a possible correlation between time and location , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data taken at the same location at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera mode . if the devi@@ ation below is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you don &apos;t have track data from a place for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the pictures . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place . since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do so , select the region and increase it . always choose this region until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to mount the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the selection allows you to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML . you don &apos;t need to select these albums in a hierarch@@ ical way . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the Ap@@ pear@@ ance Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery where each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture a new page is opened in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated pictures . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export that contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images .
with other color depth you can change the default color depth . naturally , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically shut down . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation . the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing pictures .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and folders . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after startup , a picture is shown by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less Module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , as no compression of the colour information takes place . this can be found , for example , in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool so you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mailing list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG code@@ c module is a tool to convert a number of images into an MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG code@@ c module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can insert a base image transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player .
first , you need to select the images that should be packed in the MPEG slide show . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds to display a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . remember to trim the extension mp@@ g if possible .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie by pressing the code . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now take a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back again .
if a critic appears that codes or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the Settings right below .
the printing wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print out with the Gim@@ p Module directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format to one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from him is : do not expect d@@ cra@@ w to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera operates in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information on your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere you should not select the JPEG format as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG image in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to break this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . however , this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image size .
proportional ( 1 dent ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : change of size in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
non @-@ proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepares the image for the photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent in advance .
after you have started the module , the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images via the button images . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right @-@ hand side .
you can also drag images onto the picture list and drop it to add you to the list of images to be sent .
to remove images , remove the selected images from the list of images to send .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject here . the images selected by you are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure you don &apos;t send too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails to send . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will have to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is enclosed .
the P@@ NG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . therefore , you should use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG images in JPEG format and the original JPEG format files , then the original images will be added to the images to send .
when the process is complete , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will start automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions by means of Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; File Name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option will show that the file name of the images displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation will be displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option images random@@ ly select that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
between the images , the temporal distance between the individual images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should check this before you show your friends !
there are over a dozen transitional effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , any transition between images sel@@ ects another effect .
during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous one and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation currently . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module wallpaper is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; Photo@@ album ; Browse through them , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now entries in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in the group keywords .
in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
if you click on the entry with the mouse , the browser &apos;s view changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images are displayed on which both persons can be viewed . by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all persons , places and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view images of your area of action .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , which of course applies also to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined for yourself .
in order to display images next to the names , select the button on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can , for example , display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to select the Picture An@@ gle window ( described in more detail ) and select the category Editor in the contex@@ tual menu . in the View window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . this dialog can be viewed on the image again .
if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to be sought ; the date can be either a part of the total data , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window you can search all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here is illustrated by pictures where Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the home page of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; start photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; Photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu help the menu entry k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo . then , some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this strip you can see here : . as the name says , this strip shows you data statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the previ@@ ew@@ ed entries from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and dra@@ gging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of this period will appear in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the one is available as module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version which you can create via the menu File HTML ...
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and target . in the following each area is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the moment and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ Ex@@ ample pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select whether you want to create a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file to be seen on the overview page . you will find more information about the export files in .
finally , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid information that is visible to the viewer even without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why they are not specifically dealt with .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this allows those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images which , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time that you have set . so it can search your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transmission time . if you want to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this settings area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
best of all , select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can select either a folder or a supported protocol , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser , after the pages have been created , will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you have created aren &apos;t yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , properly works you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all been related to root folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; K photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create your pictures with these . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you must work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this work will not do again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all the images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu ...
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the Man@@ ually option to copy near the .@@ k@@ im file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally move near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zi@@ p files . since most images are already compressed with JPEG , and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want this anyway , simply select the option Export File compressed .
the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Im@@ porting ... menu , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in the description .
the im@@ porting assistant is four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images should be copied .
it may be that you are the category person of the file person@@ er to import ( if you are a domain ) while this category is in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and what categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and look at pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) fixed information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tability .
K@@ Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently it also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can save with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where they want .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; mem@@ ori@@ ze the folder where your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then start a different folder tree with images , you can start with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the User &apos;s Guide , the various settings are explained .
to the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call on the F1 key by pressing a button and click on the option you want .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up full member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a medi@@ gli@@ de as explained in .
see the settings available to you for setting up the member groups . with the list listed above you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ code and g@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most of the modules have a help page , which you can access via the modules themselves .
since the modules are used together from several applications together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using this on your own pictures The &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; demo database can either be called using the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t tell me , I wouldn &apos;t have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; K photo@@ album do not work . this is the down@@ side when sharing features with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications categ@@ ori@@ ze their images into albums : here , an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; K photo@@ album ; this type of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order by albums so that you can use the features with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , so all the images that show you the picture show at the moment .
in addition to the current album , Photo@@ Album needs to be added ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; K photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will be the category that you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you are using the category persons , you will do so , so do if you have selected people to view this and pass it on to the module .
since some modules are with &amp; k@@ Photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select in the area modules which modules should be loaded .
on the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you get a photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top a tool@@ bar and tool@@ bar . under the tool@@ bar you can see the window with which you have entered your image database . currently , we will return to this window , but now click on the entry images to show you an overview with all available images .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the ability to ann@@ ot@@ ate each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons depicted in the image , etc . you can set each picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by speci@@ fying characters , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is to reloc@@ ate the images in the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can so that the used names are moved up , the persons find and assign .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the list to sort by date on the list .
if you have selected comments for each image individually , you may still want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the before and back buttons that are located under the thumb@@ nail of the image on the upper right corner .
if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is an over@@ group , a special icon will be displayed .
in the Com@@ mentary dialog context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which provides you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you would like to see this window later , use the Options ... and then hide / hide windows . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the entry pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or of all images if you have not set any filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply pointing down@@ wards of the mouse with the middle mouse button .
when you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set up as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on an image , it will be displayed in the picture viewer . if you do not have a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove key or select Edit option in the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; K photo@@ album ; namely images even without having you stored on the hard drive . of course , you must have the images stored somewhere , so that you can record in the database index . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images where the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard disk . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 , however , thumb@@ nails are present , so that you can preview these images . however , you cannot view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so far you don &apos;t have to ask for the inser@@ tion of the respective CD . so , if you want to avoid trouble , how to avoid mess@@ ing up your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the Pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you in@@ accessible and click on Current View in the Privacy menu . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see and elect all except current view .
this way you have set which pictures should be hidden in case of case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , so all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again displayed , click Lock .
it is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply choose password change in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure . on the one hand , all pictures can be found on the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to take a look at private pictures .
the reason you spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in it . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it with your mouse and put it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and down the picture . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how frequently it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full@@ screen mode and back .
when you are using the viewer you can move in and zoom into the image . to zoom in , simply drag a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us key you can zoom in again The Plus key zo@@ omed in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of zo@@ oms .
with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not shown zo@@ omed . with the tie @-@ key sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the picture .
note that the single zoom operations work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the shooting functions from the context menu you can rotate the image . this is not working with videos . you can make comments to the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to preview only the picture and see more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to develop the images on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while watching one after the other .
for the two examples above , the viewer has the possibility to provide images with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in you see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set .
once you have set features on your images , these are available in the browser . so , if you have all the images you can edit , print or whatever you have selected , just put all of them at once with comments . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview . if you wish to view categories in the preview window , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case , you will allow you to paint on the picture .
the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can reverse your painted later .
in order to stop the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the image from the context menu . to exit the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ not model@@ er ; you must use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have absolutely read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an object that is already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the correct position :
with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click on Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on the user or disc@@ ard the changes with ab@@ ort .
when you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; -@@ User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when editing a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview in the property view .
press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture mapping ) , tick locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button , thereby changing the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts .
each object has a level of view as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected or their level of view is smaller or equal to the visible level of view selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ not model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the attached to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the attached to the right or left side of the view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the viewer in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the flash@@ cards at the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to resolve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the fan onto the desktop or click the small arrow pointing left in the panel bar .
to close a view click on the small cross in the address bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between arrow and cross .
you can add additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere .
you can save the current window view with view window arrangement ... save it . it displays a dialog where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 does not support .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item View Sc@@ ene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and the quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... select the following dialog :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to have a name that lets you see the features of the mode .
in the size of the map , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the picture , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in the field of combination quality , you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection light . a detailed description of the render features can be found in the User Manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this feature are better off .
if you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of the super @-@ sampling . adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling the neighbouring pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because each pixel is further divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is split into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are individually pursued and checked for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process called j@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch J@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the final setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated using POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not hit an object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly ended , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently , &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er does not yet support the complete scope of commands from &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; if error messages or warnings occur when im@@ porting , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray . this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; cu@@ v@@ ray models ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ not model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the Properties view , &amp; cu@@ v@@ ray ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your retention and the version . the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 will be supported .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type features .
you can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the Wire Model Vi@@ ews . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more detailed wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high detailed fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time to render .
when you cross wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you want to activate channel smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method will be used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more exact information about the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window configurations or create new window configurations . in the Window Dec@@ ision section , it explains how to create and store window orders .
the drop down sel@@ ector standard window arrangement : displays all existing window configurations . &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program .
the Add @-@ in window promp@@ ts show all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected order with the button Rem@@ ove .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window layout . new views can be added to the Add button and Clear selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
the new column &apos;s position . with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with card card you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ not model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this manual , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you will only receive a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should follow these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to render the rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
to follow this tutorial , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . so you now have a scene without objects .
this is the view of the scene from the camera point of view . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find more details .
do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you click the Apply button or click the input button , the wire @-@ model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert End@@ licher C@@ entri@@ cular Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ not model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as ground :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire @-@ model view now also shows the level , although at the moment only as a fin@@ ite fin@@ ite layer . if you render the scene , the plane extends to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the object properties view .
in this scene , you should move the ground to exercise a unit below the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters . select a shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog box opens , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select First object . the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( Name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you see how the pigment now looks .
of course , the Pig@@ ment Pre@@ view only shows matted black material , because you still have to re @-@ enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the Qu@@ ader and Sphere in the preview , click on the Apply button and then go to the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the Color List you need to enter two new attributes , called one @-@ color . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more frequently , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , always choose colour @-@ coloured and change the colors in the object properties view :
this step you should already be able to do as you should have understood the basic method of working with &amp; k@@ not model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor :
in the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the user button ) , that the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the floor , because you have shifted the ground around a unit down .
of course the rendering now gives a wei@@ rd result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have chosen the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the bottom , give the sphere a pigment as a color :
select First object and change the name , for example , in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click on Apply or press the input button .
the settings gloss effect and reflection result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal : not selected yet :
you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ not model@@ er . I hope you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional picture of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots the hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene . the R@@ ender calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have . thus , the scene pixel is processed for pixels .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered is a few light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be stored under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edi@@ ting Un@@ usual .
save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ nu@@ b model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands pres@@ et for &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
opens a dialog for the creation of tool@@ bars . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ rep@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
a dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without modi@@ fying each diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file both for a dump map and for texture mapping .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart .
&amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full@@ screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can click on the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in its own window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show dialog , there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the mode of operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the other two short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option , &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when ending the name of the last opened folder . next start opens &amp; cu@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; so set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed , which can also display the program .
with this option the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for larger images . this option is turned on as default setting .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows right next to the input field . the default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts to the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short instructions for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ piece view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in short presentation .
shr@@ inks the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
display the picture in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
open the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Photo processing based on digi@@ ti@@ zed ; image editing . &amp; show@@ screen@@ shot ; is part of the digi@@ code ; project .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image editing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ shot ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ shot ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ shot ; then we would encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ shot ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to join &amp; show@@ shot ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions to join the developers mailing list by &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; try to give as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of show@@ screen@@ . to access these settings , you must select in the Settings show@@ shot ; the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the field of exposure indicators you can choose the color that is displayed when the under@@ exposure indicator was selected . skill@@ fully , the colors with what you should indicate should stand in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and exposure to a dark color .
the main window of show photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected pictures . you can also find the same side@@ bar in the image editing . you can view them in which you click on one of the five tab@@ s :
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do no more than scan and store images .
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer performs as images to scan and store images . &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be placed on the command line of &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; with the command Ch@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . stop ab@@ ort , and exit .
the other settings also contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not handle these options especially .
to scan an image , the user can start a preview and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the full preview goes into the window .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read by the scan button .
if you preview a preview in the settings before saving , the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , the image will be saved and sent to a demo@@ lition and you will return to the main window .
the Settings button will open the dialogue of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the way you want to save . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each sc@@ anned image . if you want to save it automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... change .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the automatically saved images , and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time high when a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; the button Settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish .

below you will find a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking on the Player window and set up the Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... by right @-@ clicking on the Player window and select short@@ cuts ... select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . by doing this , make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , most of which can also be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . an example call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break might &amp; z@@ b ; look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed due to a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and use k@@ dialog so that the user knows why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
using D@@ CO@@ P , you can exchange scripts with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages enable execution of external programs and commands . in this way , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it .
configure En@@ ables the script to show the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder to the folder where all the data should be stored .
track@@ Change shows that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions you could ask for more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ res@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) . to remove an entry , use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to perform e.g. clean@@ up work . this includes saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script pack@@ ets with the exhaus@@ tion of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script pack@@ ets right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights :
when your script package is complete , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; app@@ . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collection Browser and Quick search , you will find the piece within seconds .
you might have some play@@ lists but can never decide which one you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if you still find it hard , choose dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many other useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right one to re@@ discover your music !
usually , you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the System Requi@@ rements section .
enabled de@@ bu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards for setting up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
in addition to displaying the player window , the player window will switch to the playlist as well . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
creating atmosph@@ er@@ ically : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . thus , the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer is changed .
add voice files to the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ le compiled . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the Settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is required .
other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
when you want to save play@@ lists while moving , the current playlist will automatically save you when moving from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist in the end .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will be used . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
to keep the current piece visible in the piece change causes the play@@ lists window to roll up / off to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area .
when changing parts to the context browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust the appearance and Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is part of three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the usage of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting Custom fon@@ ts , the otherwise gray represented section will be selected . you can choose fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows and context browsers . press Option ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the choice of Custom colour scheme you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated underneath for foreground and background color .
resume playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece in place with which it has been stopped at the end of the end .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to turn on the O@@ SD . when using on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings directly in this preview .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . a click on the color icons opens the dialog for color selection . if personal colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the display text input box displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to determine which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD is supposed to appear .
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers still activate more settings in this card card .
the collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , check the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Browse both the selected and their sub @-@ folders to music .
monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes and Amar@@ ok ; add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . then , the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the Part In@@ cen@@ tive Database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination panel Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is needed .
My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on Calcul@@ ator : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . afterwards , the network port will be entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the load map@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
enter your User@@ name and Password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call@@ back similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this setting , &quot; Amar@@ ok &quot; will retrieve a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the tune played . note : you do not need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok needs only the k@@ deli@@ bs package and no other K@@ DE packages . so you must have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions , such as the O@@ SD , require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash . after that , you can delete the file and create the collection again .
most of the time , this is because tag@@ li@@ ar crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more sophisticated .
make sure that all libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X comp@@ iles , this will result in crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically start with a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script sol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; doesn &apos;t exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ day , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the per@@ l module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the correct version first .
most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please insert only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; appears only an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intuitive , the start @-@ down window was converted to the statisti@@ c window . you &apos;ll find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the rating column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the playlist tab and select a column review . click anywhere in the new evaluation column to specify the review for one piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist to the playlist and drop it down there just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the playlist of the playlist , right next to the Add @-@ button , the playlist button is stored . click it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( right click ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be : which media types are supported by G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support almost any audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not include MP3 entries ( for pat@@ ent@@ wise reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input key
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you to find the problem cause and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you might need to provide a different sink ( eg@@ . oss@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you &apos;d just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with the highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ M co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlar@@ ging the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the arts driver , but instead use G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ am@@ ers react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , th@@ aw@@ s &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute all m@@ peg files once as a system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run svn register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report it to bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. If you have a full list of suggestions / requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you are arous@@ ed by the soft sounds of the music you have stopped before going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on another computer ?
if a functioning SS@@ H environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running part : SS@@ H -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP address and your username . this assumes that your identification is present in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ R@@ SA .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window , which can be changed in size .
the combination of C@@ tr@@ l + rights activ@@ ates a piece in the click sequence in the queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but how does it look with the icon in the system section of the control bar ?
in the context menu , you can choose which browser you want to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS mount . after starting Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you must link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD in the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them into the desired target folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic code , instead take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , with F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ;
basically this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can edit the rating for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the valuation of a piece as well as all other attributes , i.e. by right @-@ clicking on the piece and selecting : selecting rating or pressing F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the metadata edit dialog .
developers do not want you to tell you when to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means that K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that will not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying too . des@@ elect the option symbol while playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select Settings tool bars ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design or create your own . then install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context browser design , click New Design to install ....
the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area allows you to monitor and control of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing in the Kon@@ quer@@ or . then start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( the top ) and select in the Add Amar@@ ok drop @-@ down menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to the information about which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and a password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please install the latest version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of error reports .
presumably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you must &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
if G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , you will need to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you must install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re @-@ compile and install again .
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How to fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you must compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok .
I receive the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad also has to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and then run as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
set Set@@ ting Amar@@ ok ... Add audio output to the device . typical is for example h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio in the x@@ ine setup dialog , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ lib takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound card support m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not being looked after further . you may naturally like to take this problem by yourself ! if you would like , you can become the new urgently needed super@@ visor for Arts : )
listen to music should be quite easy ! for this reason there is the setup wizard , which will appear at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in just a few minutes .

in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . in the navigation area , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser .
context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail . they provide information about the current piece to different aspects .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information presented there is now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the sub@@ window music displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first area in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to find the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating .
to display covers in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ eces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist . &quot; &quot; &quot;

this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try and Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the internet . if no text script is yet running , you can choose which to be started .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required for this .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Artist - only group@@ ed the top layer , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are sorted by artist and below will be a further division according to the respective album . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year for an album is unknown , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All records of your collection are alphabe@@ tically displayed among each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can adjust and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section of the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter is a selection box , with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . there are different time windows available , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year . in addition , you can of course also select your complete collection , whereby the filter is practically switched off .
right @-@ click on an entry in the Collection Browser you get the following options .
load - This will empty the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will achieve the same effect .
set the pieces in queue - This function will add the pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as play@@ lists . you are asked for a name under which the list is to be stored .
transfer to Media Player - Add the pieces to the media player for transmission . for more details see the section on the Media Player Browser .
all pieces of this interpreter burn / Bur@@ n CD - This will then send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burn either as a data or audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit Met@@ adata ( for n pieces ) ... - Displays the dialog for piece information and lets you modify the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) move files in the tr@@ ash@@ ns ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark the selected album as a compilation , after which it appears among various performers .
record compilation - Chan@@ ges a recorded album back into a normal album . after that the album will no longer be displayed under various performers but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes handling of many play@@ lists very easy . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these utilize &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for run@@ time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
you can also create play@@ lists created by yourself . click Smart playlist to open the dialogue to create a new smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired title from the playlist and drop it on the performer list . if you &apos;re done , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod .
among the tool@@ bars is a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files will be hidden , which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , there is an address bar where you can pick music from an entered URL . if you type : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the music file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping files . in this case , holding the Shift key can be helpful : as a result , dropped files can be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries into the desired position by using the mouse . once you enter the letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one in two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
for example : one OR or two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) are found .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then complete the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries contained by Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries , such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you may also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , put a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR Frequ@@ ency : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that include either Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ clicking on the entries in the desired order . the entries then receive a marking with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left , you will find the link you can add to the playlist . to the right , you will find playlist , empty play@@ lists , and Rand@@ om M@@ iss .
next , the buttons follow the undo and restore buttons , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist .
a unique , larger analy@@ zer is located in the center of the tool@@ bar . the refresh rate can be adjusted to the Analy@@ zer by clicking on the right mouse button .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the menu visible in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration via this menu .

the status bar shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status of shu@@ ffle mode and retri@@ eval , a slide control for the playing position and the playing time of the current piece will be displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , de@@ activate the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist on the menu . you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok via this menu .

the queue management received your big move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number next to the title appears in the playlist . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will be played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( details on setting up these follow later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add any other random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
double @-@ click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window , or right @-@ click on you and then select loading . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in a pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; : does all sorts of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; has all the functions that also &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases reaches &amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; however , a higher quality for burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and en@@ coder modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . currently it supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial en@@ co@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 en@@ coder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio en@@ coder module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : additional libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is for example possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ coder module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without Norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can result in the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces play differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu includes a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As is displayed by which you can select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and editing . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each un@@ saved project what to do with it , as if you had called C@@ lose for each Project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project , it is asked what to do with it , as if you had called file close .
when you call this entry , you can select files for addition to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium . the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by what is that ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears for an active data @-@ CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful when you create files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session will always be included , even if this function is not used . it is more likely for you than help to see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this entry only appears for an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function removes no files from the medium , it only displays the previously imported files .
it also allows you to create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . you should also use cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
it also allows the copying of a DVD to a different medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD that you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of copying a DVD with the help of copying a DVD . therefore , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . this allows you to delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , so the content will be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes Over@@ write and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog will prompt you for an * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data , which can then be fired at once by pressing the firing button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be fired at once by pressing the firing button .
a previously used DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used everywhere . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even possibilities for changing the size and cutting black edges .
this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of tool@@ bars from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar at the bottom of the window is displayed . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive has been selected with an appropriate CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible if the project view has open projects . the header does not have any real function , it looks only pretty and clearly separates the view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box to change key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can change the key signature down below .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs , so system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be done . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work immediately . this dialog is intended for person@@ alizing and fine tuning of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is more important to which of the programs you give preference .
in this chapter , we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line tool . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following on the console :
besides the common &amp; D@@ CO@@ P features , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supported &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts that are described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features features like copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) uses D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void generic D@@ v@@ d ( ) void generic D@@ v@@ d ( ) void variable D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly generated project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively , you can obtain a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project obtained using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void , cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ ul@@ ls ( Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ ul@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string New@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ string id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der test d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ Audio Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ Read for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the en@@ coder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio Creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many en@@ co@@ ders that en@@ code these wa@@ v files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( This encoding packages must still be added from the Linux distribution ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and saved in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also into other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other en@@ co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , only the Ko@@ di@@ ver packages must be installed that are needed . if for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction about coding , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not handle protection , it is not possible to avoid copy protection . simply avoid purchasing copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up needs to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , it will subsequently explain the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble across in the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . by step , step by step , you will find more information about how this program is used , as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must be made first . )
start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the code settings tab - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders so that the selection can be read with another en@@ coder as the default . note that before the en@@ coder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the File Manager , so an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( like protocols , be@@ eps ) for program events ( such as read out the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with various flash@@ cards ( like en@@ coder , to set up the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , en@@ coder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psych@@ o @-@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , the differences are less important as both codi@@ fiers produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still provided free of charge with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG gambling machines is available .
MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate app . 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a track . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR shared stereo , compression rate approximately 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b through the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can hand over / needed with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help with the en@@ coder explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keyword ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio creator must be added . the result looks as follows : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs , the information can be downloaded / entered , so that all others can download this information instead of itself into the computer . it is to be noted that only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ les , artists , names of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of translator : that is the author meant ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a bum@@ ble through one &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for using fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than the one installed in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; audio creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit at fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually issued monthly ) only the updates of the database .
what selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know it more accurately , search the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see Note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done .
for the first opening , pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) can be found on the tab for setting up the encoding . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added to this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for pre@@ defined en@@ co@@ ders . for more information on en@@ co@@ ders , please refer to the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a en@@ coder , you can obtain more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) , and &apos; l@@ ame &apos; must be replaced by the name of the installed en@@ coder .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reader experience on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this won &apos;t work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
did you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure about what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine as it is considered not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something that will probably be done once and for all .
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what each listing &amp; CD needs to be repeated .
here we determine the code to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) and the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are la@@ zy , we divide the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time reading a &amp; CD ; if the appropriate settings are found once .
the device name is passed to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , the effective device name can also be specified . if the drive can be accessed with other programs , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries in the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the flash@@ card general settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left as left / ke@@ yed as shown in the screen shot .
only in case of incomplete information request information , so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the card card CD ; -@@ settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b computer .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before . however , if you want to use the database before . however , if you want to use the data in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know what data the CD should get ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server nearby . on this track , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as there are many fire@@ walls supporting the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should be enough .
just take over the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of concur@@ rent pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one available drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , so try it yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : tick this to throw the CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you cross this , then / must specify the path / folder in which the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if only space on another drive is present . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
just enter everything in the same way as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be strai@@ gh@@ tened to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later modification of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of concur@@ rent WAV files : with a du@@ al@@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; finished . this configuration is used as a standard for any output of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create and setup MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; the process described in this section must be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data obtained for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn to insert data manually instead of retri@@ eving them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try to find the &amp; CD ; this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD ; in the drive , which was defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , just like in the screen shot . this only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for the Help section in the FAQ section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the songs have already been filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; a window is displayed , and you can select the database entry that matches your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic quer@@ ying of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page and CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you will need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 2 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments line size per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
note : after successfully retri@@ eving the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. if all words begin with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this option is set on the encoding settings tab ; take a look at the section &apos; Basic settings &apos; .
you can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all en@@ codes or file formats . see the help of the en@@ coder to get more information .
just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the out@@ going CD ; in this example , this is not important as we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; anyway . for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org website and read the information about categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you will return to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the current piece &apos;s fields .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the parts list .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked so are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or off . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
by clicking on the selection button to read the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is located in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window for controlling orders . the first piece is just read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message will show you if you are trying to work with a code you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and destination folders ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new record : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format . thus , read out and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . with powerful machines , the result is unclear . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read , while another piece is coded and a third order is in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is coded , a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you will need the en@@ coder of your choice .
you can download an anonymous rep@@ lica from there . most of the distri@@ butions have already a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you are reading this , you probably already did ...
this section is directed to people who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help , how the program can be customized to your needs when it happens , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any c@@ lue how to continue from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; it is intended . whoever wants to add or change anything useful can do it . at least after cont@@ acting the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal .
strange if you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also features real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time raising of texts also some characteristics that other &amp; UNIX ; - MIDI @-@ players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is involved as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color so that it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag on k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically detects the procedure used .
session support . when you finish a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialogue with which help you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; window will drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any position by using the middle mouse button and moving back and forth with the slider .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows on the left and right of the speed display to change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar , like pressing the button break or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text , others use song code and again other both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , which uses a song so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ a@@ oke text . but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries in the Settings menu . the same function also includes keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can sum@@ mar@@ ise . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click here on New to specify the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking to copy and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the entries in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song to the Add button . again , it appears to the file dialogue with which you can select the desired song .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to collection .
if automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then add the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu list of the menu Colle@@ ctions , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to skip a song , select Next Song , the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump back a song , select the Previous piece , select the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all of the change patch to B@@ right Piano events into the events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map , because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
there are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI @-@ Maps , so you need to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
default PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail to help me in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section , it is stated how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard , for example , does not support a gun ( GM patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) that sounds similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it will patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and play the sound 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here is the term Tro@@ mp Patch of the patch , where each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the note represents the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Key@@ maps &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . for example , take a look at the supplied keywords . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on the N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map with the name name for this channel will be used . if you use the Key@@ map option , all occur@@ ren@@ ces will be ignored , which attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x will be used .
the option For@@ ce@@ Patch can be useful , for example , to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der R@@ atio announces in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multip@@ lied . if an MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der occurrence with the value n , it is converted with the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed only . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM records that a keyboard , which receives a pitch benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , will play a tone higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two sounds up to one oc@@ tave . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try around .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to use a MIDI @-@ map , simply open the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; MIDI Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog . this can be found in the Settings menu , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Midi &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list , where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings on the channel view : settings
the tempo change shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality .
this may happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. by k@@ mid ; &apos; s homepage )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files individually .
OK , therefore , supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on one &amp; k@@ de ; - Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - Windows with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) .
if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , switch the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ G. , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so you set the automatic addition to the collection and open A@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then decide to play with B@@ mid and C.@@ G. and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this encourages me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an expansion of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you want to make me simply happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; list ( if you want to ) . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and doesn &apos;t give money to anyone for it . I would like to stress that I &apos;m not programming only because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also is Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Magn@@ us Pep@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ tho@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , which give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid may also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; c@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the website The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; user mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned .
it is possible to save preferred links under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarch@@ ical level . if you select an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback will begin with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / folder can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself .
after changing XML files , you have to select playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and changing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during start does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be disturbing in the end animation , so the user can finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite picture : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; body ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = \ home / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / ;
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog from &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the Tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here the output of mp@@ layer can be seen .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog from &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE must be specified .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . the started process is kn@@ ur@@ layer . if there are no mistakes here , the back@@ end issue is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so that always a given back@@ end for a certain mim@@ e type is taken ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog can be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . the encoding must be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
various names are used internally by K@@ M@@ Player . at the time of the origin of this documentation , dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ r@@ source , source , source , source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ r@@ source .
is there any hint about how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is run as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure / dev / c@@ drom is on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does every time my CPU have to be checked for its performance ?
note : the answer is out@@ dated . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

G@@ opher allows the user to save the position of a desired information in a book@@ mark ( book@@ mark ) , so that the user can get directly to the information with the help of the book@@ mark without having to browse the entire menu . g@@ opher menus are not standardized , so that each g@@ opher server contains certain information .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support , and is required to compile &amp; boot .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely applied to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux file distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be included .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these enable easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the Ki@@ le ; website .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact about the box should be made .
if you have any questions , or if you want to compile &amp; delete , please contact the mailing list box Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the ability to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; features in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; and finally to be called the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to learn about its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin there directly by reading the chapter working with the editor of Po@@ sters .
for &amp; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unci@@ ation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use can also use a lay@@ man ( english lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; mac@@ ros . a less sophisticated but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
just a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to handle properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
just like other identification languages , &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction that defines the general properties such as paper format , page number@@ ing and text size as well as a body with the text . the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start assistant by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful feature for the quick creation of a document in &amp; box ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for the creation of the document . it can also be made some of the document related settings .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; letter &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
code : the character encoding of the system will be set . modern systems use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is only a brief description of the functions and further information on this is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source editor - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is noticed by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless . however , it will save you by high@@ lighting time and saving r@@ ger .
when entering a new command ( eg . \ \ begin { order } ) from &amp; Ki@@ le , automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { order } ) . this function can be set in the Settings box ; set up La@@ Te@@ X commands .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to be divided into the following elements ( the most important and sub @-@ paragra@@ phs ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed through a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; file searching can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file was created , jump &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and besides PDF is the standard output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the mode search , the elements of the DVI file are linked with the editor and once on an element in the DVI ; file has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding section in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text has been cli@@ cked .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document , work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings .
quick setup : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; locally &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Guard &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , after the fast construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit Tool@@ bar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection fields were developed for the fast inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for the quick breakdown of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is for adding items such as keywords , joint notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified designation ( select a selection box possible ) .
the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down sel@@ ector with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ Ã ¶ r is used for defining the font size . it is possible to specify the font size for the main text , the feet etc . , the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font size . if the font size is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is to use the menu building or the quick assembly button .
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; does the storage automatically .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using fast construction , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , it should also be considered logging .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few places should have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } would then allow the opening of the font in the surroundings ( Hu@@ ge ) .
the changes are provided solely within the environment ( by \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no limitation ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold , cur@@ sive , under@@ cuts , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the \ \ end command or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics printing and is available until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a phrase can be itali@@ c itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } itali@@ c .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made for the better legi@@ bility of the document . at least one quote , a few passages in the fat and ital@@ ics print and a poem are used to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor @-@ View or C@@ tr@@ l E can return to the Editor again ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its window must be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing ( in viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file into other formats . once the DVI file is created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the transformation into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview mode allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers an appropriate setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; Bin@@ ding files . to do this , simply set up Modern under Settings box ... Tools to be selected .
in order to execute the preview search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on forward searching . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer is then performed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; opened and bound to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; quot ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; to be specified as text editor .
if the quick installation of the &amp; DVI file does not open , a fault can be present . if an error is present , this is summari@@ zed in the log file or in the message window .
the logging file tells the source code source code . in the editor the buttons can be used for predic@@ tive La@@ Te@@ X errors and other La@@ Te@@ X errors for spr@@ ints between errors . the logging file always indicates the line in which the error appears . to view the fla@@ wed line , it must be cli@@ cked on the error in the logging and &amp; box ; jumps to the fla@@ wed line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the default options are :
when selecting a blank document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard can be used for the quick creation of a new document .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file needs to be open or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document with a new file , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings cases ... settings General set .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by typing in the document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the resulting entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template should search for a template found on the Internet and the steps below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and emerging from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters , and its possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted to Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can begin there directly by reading the chapter working with the editor of Po@@ sters .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; and their syntax .
double @-@ clicking with pressed C@@ tr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; that means that in this way , when clicking on \ \ par , \ \ \ big@@ skip , just \ \ par will be selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and emphasize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ statements from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many Wiz@@ ards can add additional jump marks . this is a special kind of book@@ mark inside the text . the menu entries do the jump marks or the respective ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes allow the jump to the next or last jump brand .
editing is probably one of the key aspects when using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; Even though &amp; kate ; already excellent options have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; lat@@ ex ; always support many environments and groups , and therefore support &amp; kick ; special commands for their selection .
select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
this selection also has an extended meaning as this command also sel@@ ects &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back @-@ back character ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; cade ; provides the Key C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; box ; provides with own commands for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text are included :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for further orders under Edit surroundings for an easier work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jumps to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to save the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jumps to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted environmental commands , the over@@ look can be lost quickly . this command bu@@ ys the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environmental structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups defined by brackets { ... } . under Edit te@@ x group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment .
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly locked clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the sharpen@@ ed bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jumps to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted gra@@ ded group brackets you can quickly lose the overview over . this command bu@@ ys the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple recept@@ ac@@ les are used as gates . for the useful implementation is used in &amp; box ; the character &apos; is used for two simple quotes . also for the ending of the appropri@@ ation the character is &apos; used . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and for two end @-@ to @-@ end quotes for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one .
this automatic inser@@ tion of the double suits can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
you can also use foreign language settings ( e.g. n@@ German or French ) and there@@ with German or French suits . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting from Shift , enter key &amp; box ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; box ; not only a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a tables environment bu@@ r &amp; box ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ ending line breaks down .
even better - &amp; ki@@ cking ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or custom environments . these can be added under Settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to align the columns in tables environments and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; try to achieve this . while pressing shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; ki@@ le ; according to the next tab in the underlying line .
although &amp; kate ; already a good source code processor offers , this has been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings box ... Complete .
at the beginning a new environment is added using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } to an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and , unfortunately , the complete list is enlarged . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering a further letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from the selection of a command . alternatively from &amp; box , jump marks can be inserted , so that a jump to these positions can be possible by editing jump marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ste boun@@ ce mark and the desired parameters can then be added .
under Settings box ; set up ... All settings can be made to these lists . you can select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ statements and qui@@ vers of the general language use .
command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ begin and the call of the completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; cr@@ unch ; a special mode for the completion of the environments .
when you call the Save Mode menu or the Alt + Shift key , the command will be automatically added to the opening of the environment and it will appear \ \ begin { . thereafter , the ambient will be continued in the simplest way and will be finished by pressing the input button .
after this has been completed , the environment will automatically be closed again . as soon as &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a Listen directive , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings box ; set up ... All settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of functions of the complete notice mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of re@@ eds , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings box ... The file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode introduced via the menu item C@@ tr@@ l + Alt @-@ Space , the letter L will be replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large @-@ scale holes are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many boards are written more than once in a document .
this mode can be set up in the Settings box ... The load can be switched off . here , the threshold for displaying the processor can also be set .
the missing files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Persian Home folder . mode is available for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( WLAN ) or tex .
the dialog graphics are designed to make graphics as easy as possible . to review the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be taken into account .
PS files are not as familiar as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a couple &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all tree tools are group@@ ed in groups by means of compilation , creating conversion and creating view .
for the compilation of the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the Key Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI file can be used in the default viewer by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file and viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the fast @-@ build command , a viewer is normally called after comp@@ iling . if there is no integrated viewer , a new window will open up each time .
a new project will be carried out by the Men@@ Ã ¼ Project New Project .... Here you will find the following information for the project :
when selecting the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function from &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows you to run EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed by scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can change in further versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) has the following methods :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a rather sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aid to support the users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are shipped with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live , the finding of the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all to &amp; box ; supplied documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is searching for package names or perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ists . from &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or using the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; -@@ source editor which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; box ; is also available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ like systems .

&amp; sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is written by &amp; k@@ sig ; read . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures , the same signature from the signature file will be read from the signature file for the whole day . for each day , use different signatures , as with the accidental signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this will give you an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail applications such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there is always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it from the File menu or click the red cross icon on the tool@@ bar .
to change a short command , select an action from the list . then , right down , click the Custom button and enter the new short@@ code by pressing the button or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .
all call stack elements are listed here . the older the stack entry is , the lower is its frame number . see the example below .
clicking on the list of commands in the list shown will set the cur@@ sor in the main window to the corresponding line number of the file .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a graphical user interface for &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; which supports recovery of bugs in &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; scripts .

if the inspection dialog does not appear , select Deb@@ ug@@ gen Insp@@ ect ... from the menu . to edit the sources , click on the source code in the pop @-@ up dialog .
all found templates are listed here . it should be noted that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T ; apply . therefore , several templates can be present with the same matches and mode specifications .
clicking on a template in the shown list will move the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of this file .
local and global variables are shown on a card in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code in which a global and a local variable is declared .
by clicking a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable holds a specific expression , for example
then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button .
when you click on a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter will be moved to the corresponding line of this file in the main window .
the 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; All these tools use com@@ mander as surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as support . the combination gives fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de -@@ documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it a bit , give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; simply click on the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the ge@@ op@@ ed working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the desired folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as already said , everyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; there is now a great graphical interface for that .
if the newly opened file inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is , then just leave the current working folder . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book can be found .
if it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
is the file to be checked already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; then let it simply hook up the current file . if not , delete the file with the current file and select the file to be checked by other file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ Form@@ ed file is , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed Ch@@ ecker option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; which is specified in the &amp; XML ; file specified , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition UR@@ I ; &amp; XML ; schema and for the Rel@@ ax review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection required .
yes , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let the current file simply be selected . if not , remove the selection current file and select the file to be processed using the other file file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file will normally be stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the t@@ apped in &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; more about it below .
to install a plugin or a part , we begin editing the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each and GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location you use and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path for searching the plug @-@ in .
often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift + F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
one member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on notes .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is a further advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later , how much someone has worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script inser@@ ting a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the side event configuration of the Shift + F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sers selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following items :
you can either select the comment entry from the editor context menu or input the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with nick@@ name of the chosen nick@@ name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following options : team leader Sub@@ project Manager After the area and sub@@ project leaders , the respective area or sub @-@ project names should be mentioned as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here are handled only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings , a short description for the other can be found in .
settings can be set up by settings Qu@@ anta . this dialogue extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags including car completion can be changed with it . entries are :
&quot; &quot; &quot; tags : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tags : large / upper case of automatically inserted tags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; case means the tags are inserted as they are described in tag@@ XML files . &quot; &quot; &quot;
size / L@@ ump@@ y of attributes : large / upper case of automatically inserted attribute . normal / lo@@ wer@@ case means that the attributes are inserted as they are described in tag@@ XML files .
optional tags include automatically : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
automatically update the start and finish day : when enabled , the relevant day will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate code during ti@@ pping .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for the detection of different types of files . using the Standard Rest@@ art button , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the coding of newly created or otherwise than files opened with file opening ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; produces backup copies regularly so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source text at the same time .
reset the default window settings at the next start is useful when the user interface is mess@@ ed up by changing the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / hanging out views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ c@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning message range provides the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no longer .
the place to change the behavior of V@@ PL ; it can be set to display symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the image of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tured tree settings , the visibility of node in the tree , the updating frequency of the tree when working and how deep in changing the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty k@@ not are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document .
the setting of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that can be un@@ folded when editing to larger text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group for Jav@@ ascript .
plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third parties , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plug @-@ in at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ read @-@ parts typically refuse loading if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , then testing &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the entered information is correct . des@@ elect allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it shall be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger was set , just like the support for the DB@@ G Deb@@ u@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , the support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger Plugin Option , the specific settings can be changed .
if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is displayed . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened , which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it doesn &apos;t have to be paid .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session Star@@ ts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to launch a de@@ bug request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and constantly sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug request is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script , without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . happens before a de@@ bug request is given , the execution starts as soon as a requirement is placed .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next instruction in the script , where it is possible to clean up in functions and include files .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the instruction and go to the next one as if there weren &apos;t the current .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; ist ein &amp; k@@ de ; Front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g , which they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
this chapter describes how you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; can adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to become better .
document type Edi@@ ting Pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for brand and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the Tag file and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain two file types , the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and Tag@@ XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool bars are handy , symbolic guiding of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which could include text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on the conversion .
this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the property dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; self . tool@@ bars allow a quick inser@@ tion of tags into a document without the risk of writing errors .
tag folders are nothing but folder . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just @-@ element type above itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when using it , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only Family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only Family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only Family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only be used once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a just @-@ element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that group together the elements of a list . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specify the position of the attribute text within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single @-@ element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start Windows and select checking tag X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the check is only performed when loading tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
in the following example , for a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; scheme . the file name for this tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following example , for a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Super@@ load function is described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .

XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &lt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; function &quot; re@@ turn@@ Type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags
the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it accessible via DT@@ D Editor DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = Change 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D input . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as a nick@@ name .
an action can set actions ... to be created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User @-@ defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ 1 the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the settings and when the action is executed , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but then it is not restricted ) , which change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Navig@@ e.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ script t.@@ sh@@ . To find the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in its path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs the text unique will be added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document , or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script input from &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined , which is to send to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful for this setting .
according to the input , the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , to the default output run . it can be specified , what is to be done with the output written on the standard output , by setting the value the selection field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the day to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use , enable &quot; Edit Tag dialog &quot; if available , so you can enter the action when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ do edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size to others .
please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
in view of the start of the tag , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually described as loose , fixed , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user should be sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will be started ; -@@ tag in the current document will be inserted .
after creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog over Settings tool bar . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
after selecting the item you want to add to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might think that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works .
secure in the right folder . after newly created XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create one &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done this for you .
there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = func@@ tions@@ .@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation such as :
documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax , ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of box ( except reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces influence nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file that serves to shape the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation should be displayed for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ tr@@ l ; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate contex@@ tual elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are sure that they are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the different resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with promotions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places , there is an e @-@ mail menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) to send with Email , send tool@@ bars tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions will be checked and only made available if our team takes them as correct and useful for publishing . in order to contribute to this , we recommend to sign the resources for which it is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private G@@ PG key after their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New Resource you need to fill in the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scrip@@ ting tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signi@@ fication . in the event of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled .
it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages that are currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag @-@ files in tag@@ XML format might be necessary . there &apos;s the easiest way to convert DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D Load and Con@@ vert a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . after that the following dialog appears :
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Definition line : the string that appears in ! doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine setting of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to get full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , they must first introduce themselves to these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory , so that only this user can personally use them .
project related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ fre@@ es the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree view , the file @-@ tab with information and tool@@ bars .
you can click the file leader with the right mouse button to get a context menu with current document appropriate entries , such as close the current , other or all file fron@@ trun@@ ner , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or version of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited documentation contents , such as basic processing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , edit the text under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or open the file when the string is labeled as a file under the mouse cur@@ sor .
at the top of the editor window are tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . in the course of further expansion of Tools , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; paste it into your document , then click the tag that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the construction views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and ro@@ am them . in the presentation with file operators are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mou@@ sec@@ lick . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage medium can be performed with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; All possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project also works here . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the information available to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens with reference to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , some attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packaged documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two file fron@@ ts at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all DT@@ D changes are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ;
another function from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar Archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can save it to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other back up and load !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the configure script ; auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PA@@ TH before its bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML , editor , the developers of &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a stand @-@ alone , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up Langu@@ ages editor ? well , this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer confined to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good use of free software , the idea of why developed what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to extend as they need it for their needs .
with self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , autom@@ ating almost every task is possible . through the program Com@@ mander , they can extend it without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any script language syntax . ( read more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast Web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; type , or help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ inity Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , with the oldest entry removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . check the section on Tem@@ plates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , converts special characters to &amp; HTML ; description , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as a format@@ ting instruction .
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; Note that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
dis@@ ables the selection of blocks . this allows you to select text blocks with the help of Shift + Shift .
goes right to a line number . this is very helpful if you &amp; PHP ; script outputs error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of the script actions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
dis@@ abling and switching the porter on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter gets activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the columns to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with entries Previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example , to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
downloads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , how &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects , you will find the details explained .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
create a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions need to be set up by setting actions ... they are stored . tool bars are stored for tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bars to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) .
allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; DT@@ D ; you or anyone else has made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE directory , the store fails .
this menu contains a list of tags attached to the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the standard ( HTML ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting using tool bar is denied if this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the Plugins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click on it . clicking on a activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the Po@@ sters ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; with the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will activate the corresponding sub@@ window .
switches the status bar display on the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
specify the behavior of the editor window . in the Docum@@ entation of Po@@ sters , you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and modify the sequences .
this should create a help according to the mouse cur@@ sor &apos;s environment , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they will find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom , since , for example , after completing the project name , the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically .
by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you are processing local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .com ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment might be necessary .
this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently .
let &apos;s check if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included . if a project is started from scratch , not hooks .
with this option all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clip from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Pro@@ files or Shift + F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders may be possible ) , which are re@@ written for project related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this means that the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window , high @-@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set up , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by showing one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , event actions can be turned and these actions can be added , altered or deleted . event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as the backing of a file . see the details .
by default , it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project opens and allows selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening ... in the right @-@ click context menu :
different profiles can be selected here . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if only one profile exists , the button is f@@ aded to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forget about program@@ mers . this option is useful when there is a need for frequent upload of files and the rather uncertain password saved on the disk -@@ option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ loading profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialogue is displayed :
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so that it cannot be read easily , but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened , or deleted in the project tool@@ bar or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via the Tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity but also allows adjusting and adap@@ t@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to their own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bars are stack@@ ed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to custom@@ ise tool@@ bars is to add and add tool@@ bars . adding tool bars will be added at the bottom of the Add Tool@@ bar section .
the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either with context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) in which new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries are additionally removed and action processed that are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings ... and set Settings actions .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system .
some templates with &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms presented at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates .
documents can be created by any type of text document . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents will be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system based on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure group@@ ed together in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
design a document structure as you wish ( XML ; , &amp; HTML , , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As Tem@@ plate As Local template save ....
once this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree at project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can easily be dra@@ gged and dra@@ gged onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file into a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files , select a name for the template and back up . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . they can pre@@ tend head@@ lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically interact with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or associate with them . in addition , you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects .
template structure in sub@@ window templates is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates . each folder corresponds to one of four types of container , as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template view , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is f@@ aded as soon as el@@ ter@@ ial attributes are ha@@ unted .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template view . if a root folder were set so it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text block . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying content templates to a folder with special header lines / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; sourc@@ ec@@ ode editor accessible via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second tells the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL file editor works as follows : it downloads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cur@@ sor . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor if necessary , in which the implemented changes are visible in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code .
while working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document that &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit it , the source editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; the editor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; the editor is already active . pressing F@@ 9 will enable this mode to move the active cur@@ sor from one window to another while keeping the position in the document .
the Synchron@@ ization interval between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL ; view , one can choose between synchron@@ ization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow ones .
assuming that you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose tool documentation . this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the manual encoding .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down . a click into the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key word@@ 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ les@@ he@@ et by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
cur@@ sors are possible , like in a word processor , by moving with arrows . in rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculiar . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing keys and deleted using the back button or removed button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source editor . it should be noted that inser@@ ting tags will not be removed previously , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other anchor tag .
some tool@@ bars such as the She@@ ets Assistant or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release the tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for analyzing style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , do not need the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ;

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; how difficult ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later , lots of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparison and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; while automatically selecting the correct changes . the merge editor under the differences windows allows you to edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; in case of folders :
&amp; KL @-@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and resist@@ s the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently have to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visi@@ bly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can simplify the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 -@@ o target folder with diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o target folder
the opening dialog allows you to manually type file names , select the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will tell your selection and will show it next time . you don &apos;t need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences is done with two files .
by clicking on the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparison and mer@@ ging of folders will be introduced . however , if a file is selected for A , then use &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ges are checked , the input field will be active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately set an output file . you can do this later when you save it .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting to merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . in opening dialog , you do not have to select any files , you can simply close the dialog using the Canc@@ el button .
you can also use drag &amp; drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program to cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while over the line . then a small help window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , the color indicates which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) well .
when differences are found , the color displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in character strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare individual cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file doesn &apos;t have lines . if the line break is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines .
the result window ( below the reference windows ) also has an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changing &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the sprin@@ kl@@ ers to find next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison windows are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes , by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue is displayed . this is only a wild@@ card in the event that you change your mind and perhaps again insert another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : when selecting the sources ignor@@ ing the options or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters .
when you click in any of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , high , down , side on , side , end , C@@ tr@@ l @-@ start and C@@ tr@@ l End , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the output window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the insert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in any of the context columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the mer@@ ging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ above ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture up@@ stream / Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the marker to the cli@@ p@@ board , you must copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l inser@@ tion ) . if this is checked , whatever you mark , it will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copying is not necessary . however , be careful with this option because you could inad@@ vert@@ ently over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ atten@@ 3 does not retain the line ends of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; also not using binary files .
the options and the list of last used files are saved automatically when loading , and restored at the next start . ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ atten@@ 3 set up ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog provides variable width fon@@ ts , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the chosen type@@ face does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ ast@@ ened . on these systems , the pres@@ et button automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ altered color .
if this option is enabled , pressing the tab key will insert the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab character will be inserted .
if you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copying to the cli@@ p@@ board is om@@ itted .
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters will not be ignored , even when mer@@ ging white characters will not be ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , while others may only look identical to a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is checked , the carriage returns will be visible , but like a white character . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters .
intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled by default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow for very large files .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Automatic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode , this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be shown before jumping on to the next un@@ resolved conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sol@@ ves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options Ign@@ ore Fig@@ ures or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are handled in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge operation . see documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging for details .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not apply to the current program . you must &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; quit and restart to make the change active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is globally set via the control center . )
the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the top setting is used for all entries .
above the selection fields for coding a brief note appears what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
customize the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files can be compared and merged with different coding .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processor commands , you might not be able to work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre@@ processor commands .
disable this to supp@@ ress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options Ign@@ ore Fig@@ ures or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences will be displayed in a color coded over@@ see column . however , sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arrange the comparison windows side by side or over@@ lap . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files . merge the current file in the merge menu even if you just compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is handed over to this external command . in &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; then the output of the command becomes visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that exactly meets your needs . you can use this function , for example , to cut out troubles@@ ome pieces or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processor command has been specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only for line calibration . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to give the user greater flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases used or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processor command for line synchron@@ ization to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 1 in the app@@ en@@ dage string refers to the found text in upper@@ case letters . the \ \ U converts the found text in upper@@ case .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . they all follow the same pattern $ keyword created $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ $ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ atten@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line sampling . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several plac@@ ements at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the plac@@ ements from each other . example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . for example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor is maintained for displaying and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the line interval al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus looks .
note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you inad@@ vert@@ ently ignore certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often , program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders in recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions with either all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to the comparison and mer@@ ging of single files . you just have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 will be used as the base . if no target folder was specified , &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the mer@@ ging . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folders , you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress . if you break the scan of the folders , only the files that have been compared until then will be listed .
when scanning the folders is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ...
each file and folder found during scan is represented here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually displayed collap@@ sed . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can be opened and all sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open or fold all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details Pan@@ e to the selected object . in such a case the merge operation cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ ti@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then turns yellow and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. A folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. A folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the mode for syn@@ cing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directory is synchron@@ ized . then sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the necessary action from so that afterwards both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New File instead of mer@@ ging ( unsure ) is checked , then examines &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , the mer@@ ging of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging a file is executed after the other . the status column shows ready when the merge operation was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly different messages when something unexpected occurred . if mer@@ ging is complete , you should make a final check and check if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file @-@ like method is selected Full analysis , K@@ Def@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , C will be used as the target in the Three @-@ Fol@@ der @-@ Mer@@ ge mode . B is selected as the target and A and / or B will be used as the target for synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the folder structure , even in the folder structure . there are some options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid mer@@ ging actions exist due to conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog box with the options through , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el appears .
select Sim@@ ulate if you just want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; performs certain actions with all entries . if manual intervention is necessary ( mer@@ ging a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
when you &apos;re done with a file , select start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you decide the cause of the problem . if you continue the combination ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; give you the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , it re@@ members &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be completed . only if you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; ( Settings - &gt; K@@ atten@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory mer@@ ging with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS too . many aut@@ mati@@ cally produced files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
when the option is turned on , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links will show . this is disabled in default .
when the option is turned on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folder and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ) does not check for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would result in an endless loop and &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of dissolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and essentially slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the change date and the file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security . please use caution with caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of modification , there is no real comparison . the files will be considered identical if they are equal . for example , this can be useful when copying the change date . please use caution when copying . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the more recent file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is provided the knowledge that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal mer@@ ging of single files , not only the mer@@ ging of entire folders .
normally , the merge @-@ merge @-@ view stays visible to merge single files ; you can move the window @-@ divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want this , you can switch the option Directory &amp; Text window to switch main windows in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window .
you can also merge a single file directly , without having to start the folder compilation . to do so , you can merge a single file directly from the merge menu . once you save the result , the status will be set to Er@@ le@@ ur and the file will not merge again if you start the folder compilation .
however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DB@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders for opening , located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive using a local folder .
one URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be escaped . ( # - &gt; % 23 , spaces &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then a file is always assumed as a link target . ( FTP : s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change dates . therefore , the per@@ missions or the modification date differ from the original . ( note the option of confidentiality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is now as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ atten@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In K@@ EN@@ 3@@ part from the context menu .
normally needs &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a part , it takes &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Pre@@ view in - K@@ atten@@ 3@@ part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created .
when &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; run as part , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ DB@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compact ) already exists . furthermore , the name K@@ atten@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by having looked into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all program@@ mers who have gone that path or are going to go that way .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file , you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will first be treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character differs , the line will be treated as not identical . if similar lines make next to each other , this is the last but more often the case .
the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source and selecting the A / B / C button . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
the effort for this was too big so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing the text , suddenly it is lt ; No sr@@ c goes ; the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web . many thanks !

cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) to the cli@@ p@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the target folder .
( in the current program version , after changes to these options , you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when mer@@ ging . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( behavior will likely be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on any of the buttons , the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking the button .
in default this option is disabled . different characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , quit them , or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can view all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the motion can be moved both inside a desktop as well as to other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries P@@ ager set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , maximize , on desktop and exit .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , you can move windows inside &amp; Camp ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
when this field is enabled , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
cross this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is ti@@ cked together with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . work Desktop .
when this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is enabled , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window can be determined : classi@@ cally leaving &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , like from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers ; horizontal shows all virtual work@@ tops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view the windows as symbols or with their contents and move . in addition , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... allows the dialog settings to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :

this application is interesting for various users : artists , web designers and people with visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; its .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions . it is optimised for use on powerful computers .
when you start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is referred to as magni@@ fying windows . the image shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window .
the default setting expands and K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving lou@@ pe . alternatively , you may wish to display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse @-@ poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to be displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cur@@ sor setting . please note , that &amp; K@@ mag ; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor in the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you are in addition the &amp; Shift , press down or use the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the drop @-@ down window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more .
starts / stops the updating of the display . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the Update Rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the upgrade rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection box will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and smaller &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen magni@@ fier . you can magni@@ fy an area of the screen so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click when the mouse cur@@ sor stays in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ Jury syndrome ) and which each mou@@ sec@@ lick prepares pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click when the mouse cur@@ sor stays in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from the peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain . moreover , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . this requires a little practice however .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by the mere moving of the mouse . do you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to clarify this again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aid tools : the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you stop the motion briefly .
if the intelligent shift is activated , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button emul@@ ating . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the intelligent shift requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this residence time must be rolled after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click performs .
if Intel@@ ligent Posi@@ tioning is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; wait for the release of the mouse button before releasing the mouse button again when no moving is done in the meantime .
this feature activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but it can be changed later .
when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the response time . go to the Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and select the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started with each start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other Windows environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings are reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , you should leave the intelligent shift off first . if you get used to the automatic click , you can later accept the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds .
first , you should be aware of where a mouse click has no effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that do not represent a link does not result in unwanted reactions . you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse is different from mouse to mouse , but it should be clear quickly if you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or a finger@@ nail .
in very rare situations the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent shift in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you are using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using a different window manager and moving a window .
the solution for this problem is that you run a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cur@@ sor in another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor where you want to have it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to have a keyboard input . thus , an accidental move can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around tool@@ bars and menus and titles of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t make it possible to edit text .
the smart sliding is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to mark text , copy and paste it into the cli@@ p@@ board , or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse while pressed mouse button .
do not use the smart shift when you just start using it . instead , select text instead : execute a mouse @-@ click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this means that every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button presses a sound like a mou@@ sec@@ lick . so you know exactly when the move time starts with intelligent shift . later , you can use the intelligent shift also without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some exercise .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window must be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button once the mouse cur@@ sor is short . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to the stu@@ pe@@ faction .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain amount of time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a program that lets silent users talk their computers for themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text directory . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without having to type in . the text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language in order to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can match the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word completion .
the main window of mouth is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a memory of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you have set mouth correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences which should be spoken again .
with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the word completion and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the input field of the Card Map speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down field below the input field , specify the character encoding to be passed on to the voice generator .
mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text remains unchanged as default input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your voice generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
the kt@@ as@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; dem@@ on , which provides &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is meaningful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a passage passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a passage in the Text passage directory or in the bar for text passages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the selected passage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be added directly to the input field . the selected passage passage will first be entered into the input field using the selection of In the input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector of the editing window for text passage register , you can choose whether the text message directory should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
when you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text directory script will not be saved . select Before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text directory should be stored .
the word completion contains a list of dictionary entries for the word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box where this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection field , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them into a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field .
select the language you want for this source ; and mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option , you create a new empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly inserted words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided in two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books either via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt + key .
the selected text will be cut and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the editor .
the selected text is copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected portions of the editor .
the currently active movement is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed above the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is checked , a narrow strip in the lower part of the main window will be displayed with notes about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you do not have the command for the voice output correctly or not fully entered . open Settings ch@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for the voice output on the card template language edition . ( see Settings dialog for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )
festival is a language edition system of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows you to use the festival for free and without any restrictions .
to show an example of command line setting for voice output settings , it is assumed that the festival is installed in / usr / local / festival . the command for voice output is then :
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without further limitations .
to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ et . the speech output is then possible with one of the following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example for the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax happily swal@@ lows the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be turned on as default input .
the voice output da@@ emon from &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the language generator is set only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ as@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; it appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
mouth ; to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is an application , with people unable to speak , let text be issued by the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is stored , which the user can always make new editions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not include speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . on the computer a speech syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

before you can use it , you need to use the speech @-@ disc@@ pat@@ cher to use the speech @-@ disc@@ pat@@ cher .
for the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card speaker is shown . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card tab will appear General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as various male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . a so set combination of language , syn@@ thesizer , voice , gender , volume and speed is referred to as speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ ool suits for the same printer .
if you click on the card company spokes@@ man in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card card speaker will be shown . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet .
all the speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for voice output if an application has no speaker .
with a click of a mouse , select a speaker from the list , and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with one click , and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with one click , and click this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ n ; system .
choose a voice @-@ type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker appears on the Cart@@ ridge Spo@@ kes@@ person . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use . go back to the tab General and check whether voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the Language Ex@@ tension System from &amp; k@@ de . click on the General tab tool@@ bar to open this card . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the box is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled .
if this check box is selected and frac@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the system area of the control bar when read , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is complete .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , pause , pause , and resume text assignments .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be taken on all pages .
the flash@@ card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first check the text that should be read and select text read in the Main Menu . after a short time , the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; preview lines and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check the text you want to read and select text read in the Main Menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the message system from &amp; k@@ de ; that noti@@ fies you about events you set . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; conversation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages , for example set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
support a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , appears a menu item noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
filters for setting chain replacement offer a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; incorrect or wrong @-@ spoken messages can be corrected . the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which comes with &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech dispens@@ er program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the speech @-@ discourse program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of text .
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read @-@ out , the requested orders are resum@@ ed .
warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the output of the warning .
a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; have a long text read on a website , you can with &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also news .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you send orders from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for issuing longer texts that do not possess any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one of them reads , this output is stopped and finished .
first , you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters work the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may be further types of filters .
character chain replacement parts replace parts of a text with other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined character chain replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or by e @-@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML , contained in S@@ Sm@@ l .
with speech selection filters , you can send orders on a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card @-@ card speaker , you can read the text of K@@ DE news about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues to pass the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts , is sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from the top down to the bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
to set up character set filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison samples . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
using these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list of a file , app@@ end entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to select a list of languages . you can also select several languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application id running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers you must om@@ it . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter cop@@ ete .
the Label Wiz@@ ard will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Apply filter if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character @-@ setting filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so , the words must be limited on both sides by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . but if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor and # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can see it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility program must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is reachable via the environment variable PA@@ TH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker set up on the Cart@@ ridge Spo@@ kes@@ person , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker features which the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card card spokes@@ man .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the specified regular expression . is installed on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the desired requirements . click the button to the right to indicate the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your speech settings or delete all settings .
the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the Voice Output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the speech @-@ over@@ s API from &amp; k@@ de ; . the full documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require language delivery services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for preview and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; console ; window . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers mentioned supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML , -@@ XML ; -@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in the festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . furthermore , make sure the program is installed x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and can be found via the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sets are ski@@ pped or only chew@@ ing wel@@ f@@ . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , this may be remedi@@ ed by a character set @-@ up filter .

the speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license which you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE code archive , you can access the k@@ de@@ compression package with &amp; kt@@ ts . you can also download the source code from k@@ de@@ compression under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of the above languages can be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , consult the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . check also on the kt@@ ts website , for information that is not yet contained in this manual .
the &apos; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos; program uses an adap@@ table modul @-@ architecture for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you would like to extend it , please contact the development team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used to support S@@ Sm@@ l and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory .
to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including packages of k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the &apos; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &apos; program .
if you purchase the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ compression or have downloaded the tar@@ ball you created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before using the speech syn@@ thesizer , you must first check if speech @-@ disp@@ ut@@ cher works correctly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do this , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of speech @-@ disp@@ ar@@ cher . the t@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility is to be developed in such a way that the setting of speech @-@ disc@@ pat@@ cher is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can return , repeat , pause , or cancel sentences or paragraph styles .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best fitting speaker is chosen . if you want to learn more about how &amp; t@@ ts , choose a speaker , look up .
if you click Add Add actors on the tab card , and thus add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the tab card speaker setup will be displayed . for example , the module will be shown below for the module for Festival Interactive . for details on the modules , see .
enter the path to the detailed festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PA@@ TH , you just have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text passed to festival . for voices that are &amp; kt@@ ats , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these slide controls you adjust volume , speaking speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this gray , the chosen voice does not allow these settings to be displayed .
some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices need several seconds to be charged for several seconds due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you haven &apos;t set up a speaker yet ( or forget to click on user ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be shown at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ m@@ gr in the system section is visible , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ m@@ gr still does not run , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control it .
here are all the queu@@ es listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited proposition .
with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
by clicking OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other cards ) and kt@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , instead it is AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the Audio tab . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and administered . outputs of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and messages are not displayed . for more information on the message types from &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if you want G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de to be used for audio output , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
adjust the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % is approximately half and 200 free ; % about twice normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click on Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ n ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of language records :
the output of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and records these orders . once the output of the screen reader has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
news is the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you want to read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; still welcome someone who enters the room .
when a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , it adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of Screen Re@@ aders , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ m@@ gr and click Al@@ erts . the card notification message appears .
check this check box to enable the preview of &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications . if this setting is not checked , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ats ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events from the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent whenever someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC report .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; t@@ ts ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected a user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want here . default sel@@ ects the speaker , which appears in the list on the Cart@@ ridge Spo@@ kes@@ person as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , the action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event noti@@ fications for the application default ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the noti@@ fications to be read as follows :
use the Save button to store the settings for the notification in a file . use the Save button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all items except All noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( S@@ Sm@@ l ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . S@@ Sm@@ l is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently , &amp; kt@@ ts ; S@@ Sm@@ l only partially and only in the basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the standard voice , the festival is used in the edition of S@@ Sm@@ l .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 , S@@ Sm@@ l text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous .
&lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C &quot; - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ synthesis / speech @-@ synthesis / speech synthesis synthesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ synthesis / speech @-@ synthesis &quot; &gt;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and set @-@ level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sets . this allows &amp; kt@@ ats ; faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set limit recognition filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically as default . you can change its settings or add more set recognition filters , but beginners will get dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to select the speaker is to select the speaker selection . on the tab card , select which speaker you choose . switch on the speaker selection , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s selection changed . of course , you need more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with pre @-@ reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can take a very long time ,
you can then pause or cancel assignments on the card card even if the speech syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only be removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for set ends and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) at the set limits ( tab@@ ul@@ ator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the standard set recognition filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters are never used on &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( dec@@ eption ) , warnings , messages , or the output of Screen Re@@ aders .
if you have removed the normal stat@@ ute recognition filter from view , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; t@@ ts .
you can over@@ ride the subscri@@ ber settings for the application on the card selection menu . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the upper@@ most on the card @-@ card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker features are specified .
use the most appropriate speaker with all the features of an established speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , choose &amp; kt@@ n ; this speaker . otherwise choose &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , which is most likely to match the original features .
select the method to enter desired subscri@@ ber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
select the features of the speaker you want . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , don &apos;t enter anything .
select this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the properties in the area spokes@@ man , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker closest to the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( no order number is required to enter 0 ) .
kt@@ m@@ gr collapse immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get trace@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and frac@@ ts ; it was finished . probably you need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , it is possible to install a non compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or deinst@@ all G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output over AL@@ SA doesn &apos;t work if I play music at the same time with another application . if I stop a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; ein . on the &amp; console ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . information on possible solutions can be found on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I uploaded an extra voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festivals , but kt@@ m@@ gr shows this voice not .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / vocals add the new voice . as a guide you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the PA@@ TH environment variable . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card for speakers . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speaking speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into S@@ Sm@@ l . S@@ Sm@@ l has own tags , with which the speed is controlled . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting HTML , to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ S@@ Sm@@ l re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t make it possible for websites to be read with a female voice . I have set up a female festival present@@ er , but &amp; kt@@ ats ; reads the websites with a male voice .
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that the festival does not produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file will reject the GEN@@ DER tags for converting S@@ Sm@@ l to S@@ aber . the same also applies to VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate drawing filter and now I can go back or forth in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ wise or backward . on the tab order orders is displayed , the order consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question marks , ex@@ clam@@ ation marks , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) may not be filtered . instead , use a filter for syntax detection instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is available on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in the version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer , by using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
some users are experiencing conflicts in connection with AL@@ SA &apos;s audio output . if your system counts , you can &apos;t play music at the same time and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freeze , if you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support any real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set is pre @-@ read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general setting of the speaking speed but is otherwise not necessarily necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
have you &amp; kt@@ ts ; downloaded as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , log in as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . switch to this folder and enter the following commands :

the following modules for speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a run time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution guidelines ) .
default is &amp; kt@@ ts ; installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = target option . for example
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the correct folder for programs that are translated from sources .

before using &amp; kt@@ ts , check first if your speech syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice requires festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in the festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit@@ - ) encoding like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the Festival as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed but in the folders festival / lib / . instructions can be found at

Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ered voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java , i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; neither sound level , volume nor speaking speed can be adjusted .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any speech syn@@ thesizer which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) rather than sending output directly to the audio device .
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows managing the network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network Network Set@@ ting in the &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device even shows and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed to install Linux ; installed and configured . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , corresponding to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the option Network Set@@ ting in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds to the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the setting not @-@ again , the definition can be made permanently .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you will be required to enter the System Administration mode at the right lower end of the module .
the whole functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network Interface Unit :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to set up in the Di@@ alogue Device .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more options .
by selecting Automati@@ cally , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start , therefore no further setting is required .
with the option Manual without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration can be made . in the IP address field the desired TCP / IP address must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface while bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the instrument list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the network , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be enabled or disabled on demand . switching on an out@@ dated network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be enabled or disabled on demand . activating an activated network device can be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
determines the IP address of the host on the local sub@@ net which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface to the network in which the gateway computer is located must be selected .
a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be sorted by selecting one entry and / or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with buttons Hin@@ ds or Her@@ under in priority .
by clicking on the Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Name Server dialog .
first , you must enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list of know@@ ingly known computers describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when there are no DNS servers available . in small , shut @-@ off networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually the list of know@@ ingly conf@@ essed computers contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP is to replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known host and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will appear .
enter the name of the known host and click the Add button . if the well known host has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a particular known machine from the list and select Edit .... The edit box edit box will be shown .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be disabled .
the homepage from &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the pre@@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface can be used , such as k@@ package or the installation tool of its distribution .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and other things .
this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; compile . the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changes in configuration files will be discussed .
this area cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated .
IP networks are currently running with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to go through in the near future , so this description is currently focused on IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work place , the network administrator is the contact point to use a valid IP address or if available , D@@ H@@ CP may be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up a small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , the access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are participants in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit .
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically modified with DSL connections so it will not be surprised if there is a different content than specified there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is shu@@ ff@@ led by the scrip@@ ting in Su@@ SE . a different stand than expected may therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing .
before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; T@@ dat ; get the band back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . do not know &amp; k@@ dat ; the advance credits on the tape do not , you will be asked if the band should be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the right index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything has gone smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed through the entry of the entry for the tape .
before ej@@ ecting the tape , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to achieve this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger .
before a band of &amp; k@@ dat - can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use it to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting with &amp; k@@ dat ; . requires your tape drive to format a tape before using . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require a format@@ ting of the tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and capacity , the tape continues with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use .
before you initiate the backup procedure , you must select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select in the Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog box opens for backup . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup .
if you confirm the settings , the dialog will appear . the dialog will show the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in any of the archives and select the menu item Test ....
once the check@@ ered process has been started , the dialog box settings dialog appears . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification .
if you confirm the verification settings , the dialog appears to be checked . this dialog shows the progress of the exam process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can initi@@ alize the restore , the files that should be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in any of the archives that are associated with the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be restored .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders that have been selected will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Rest@@ ore menu ....
once the recovery process has started , the dialog for recovery appears . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog will show the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process er@@ ases all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index in two ways from the band :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all files listed under backup files , only those files located on the same file system are backed up , as the folder . folders that lie on other fil@@ es@@ ystems can be entered separately in backup files . each entry is viewed from tar independently of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before using tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
the settings can be set up via the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command is loaded to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; susp@@ end the ej@@ ection at the tape drive . possibly this setting doesn &apos;t work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , when resol@@ ving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically disc@@ ard the tape . do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to &amp; k@@ dat ; in either case , share the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only cover one memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the band has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .

the program is designed for inexperienced users who don &apos;t know where to get information about your system , or where the system is storing the various protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files .
furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems occurring on their server . &amp; k@@ system log ; therefore , try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes among other things :
support for many different types of log files , for Sy@@ slo@@ g server format and Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ logs provides functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open . will not show you this , and it opens instead of its a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not with system administrator privileges .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion , or after entered strings . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only the log lines will be displayed . in the default setting , the drop @-@ down menu will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and then enter the name of a process in the fil@@ ter@@ bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of Level Er@@ r@@ ors are displayed with a more noticeable color as minutes lines of the level indication . the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you just want to view a specific process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column process . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filtering strip .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new protocol lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ logs ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you will find more recent information about the sources of reference &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archives
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and named in the following ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start @-@ up of the system in the Linux world . it is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ in@@ it .
I will not go into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about this myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without installing a new installation and re@@ format . Linux ; kernel first looks at / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to start when you start the system or switch to a different running level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
you can also run r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run the serial port in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default Run@@ time is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following in the beginning area :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change that , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab from hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you have mess@@ ed up the in@@ it@@ tab .
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument on stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg ; a server running level that lets you run ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . furthermore , I could also have a user running level , which &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult , because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between running levels or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . in doing so , the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new area . to just copy them to a new Run@@ time , you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the Sor@@ ti@@ ern@@ um@@ mers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the tr@@ ash . be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , run@@ level 1 start , running level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones .
to move an entry into another Run@@ time , move it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ time with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sort number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the danger of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , it will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard running level@@ s. and now the machine is constantly starting . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default Run@@ time to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under Run@@ time X , but they are not executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary set @-@ up programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution : please check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just exit without message if their configuration files are not present or mis@@ placed .
the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ time to be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user .
after making changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the File menu .
the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space constraints ( quota ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings .
the Card Password Manager appears , if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD UNIX .
this card only appears if for at least one integrated fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , with the space restrictions mentioned in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation .
the card card groups inform about the group affili@@ ation of the selected user . the default group to which the user belongs will be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add to the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user and / or the selected group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
