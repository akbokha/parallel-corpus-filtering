<seg id="1">To translate the module website you will find in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras page. select the output and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated to the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. in the best case, babelfish produces a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions, without checking the translation before.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only websites on the internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page, where you can insert too translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains different modules for & konqueror;. despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making them readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">For more information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions, refer to the & konqueror manual.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in the & konqueror; to load, select Settings extension.... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the kde; addons. please note that possibly more modules are installed on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package containing & konqueror before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in the & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if present, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module View Filter (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras View Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed page. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documentantes, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views so as to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">Tree Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily recognized, can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; -command can be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for simpler navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over View color mode, can represent either depth for the easy detection of the interocation depth or the image of another file property such as Name, Owner, Group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only when there is enough space to display or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (whereby therefore display errors caused by constraints on the character of the Treemap). furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the lettering in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap representation algorithms, the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView; this target is not always observed.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. in this case, it is always advantageous for the labeling and the avoidance of space losses in such a way that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods in this respect are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum shown area for an entry over the menu entry view. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn to the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap Widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module picture gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the module picture gallery, a dialog box opens, allowing you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The option title of this page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option Image per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of thumbnails of each line in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "with the check box" "" "File Name of the Image" "", "specify whether the file names are displayed under the thumbnails in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "with the check box" "" "File size of the image" "", "specify whether the file size is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">With the check box image size, you determine if the size of the images is displayed in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the Folder folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders are to be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save file selection, specify where the HTML page should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="32">You can use the check box subfolder to set the subfolder to which level the subfolder will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images with the check box to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the check box comments file, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box sele color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnail images than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML, Settings allows you to easily access the general & HTML, settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML, you will find in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media rendition for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; View menu under Windows Navigation Pane or with shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play click on the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry to the & konqueror; in addition, you can change browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that deny access to this browser, change the browser recognition into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Change the identifier in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">With this option, the default browser recognition is used for all pages of the site you are currently visiting.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information on the browser and the operating system in the individual.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module review your & CSS; style sheets and & HTML; documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicode; includes quick picture editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the processing capabilities can easily be expanded with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in the 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with significantly more metadata, such as eg & eg; via the camera or lens that can be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & quot; Programs is also & digicode; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of end users. therefore, they should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">Wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the bug report system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the bug report system. all necessary information is entered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to contact other users of & digikam. however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; homepage to find news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to take part in & digikam; to participate, is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to log in to the developer mailing list from & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you come to the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter pathnames or click the Folder icon folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you must specify a local folder on your machine. here, the data collection is stored. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicode; you will also be using as an old library.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the topmost folder that contains images as a base folder. & digicode; looks at each subfolder as an album. no picture is altered. during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicode; During recursively the library path in all its depth. you can not exclude any subfolders unless it is in hidden folder. this allows you to do exhalbs & digitises by inserting a point in front of the subfolder's name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albian list do not have photos as icons. you can change them by using any photo from the album and discarding it on the folder symbol.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can set up & digitise; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Rohfile support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, you can handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Menu Help Menu Support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly to & digikam. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any media and card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transfer to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device.</seg>
<seg id="75">Photo2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. Photo2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is meanwhile outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and carries out the transmission of images using gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things in & digikam, is how easy its functionality can be expanded by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI Modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam; to make KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, and digitised; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes to & digitised; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Moving and dropping images works all over the world: you can discard one image in another part of the AlbenBuilder, above the horizontal partition line or into another application window. the only constraint is that one image cannot be dropped into keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- A file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. thus, filtering on the file name only works if this is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistejn; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digitized are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the Albendings or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Imported images to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there. in the then appearing menu you must select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you must right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a way to mark your albums so that you can group together under a common name. the collection you set will be used to sort your photos after collection from the toolbar or sort View Samples After collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album Date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums After date sort.</seg>
<seg id="91">The oldest, average, New Year buttons: these set the date on the of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. to this end, try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first opened an album in & digiede, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistejn. this should help you remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you must select the picture with the right mouse button and select it in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digicode; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by recreating all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image will be shown below the corresponding preview. what information this is, you can edit the digicode settings; set up the albums page and adjust the range of thumbnails to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails come with help window, which appears. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction into the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Albums and tags allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can reach all the features that have been edited with & digitized; you can choose between viewing the images, slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing using a photo by using either F4 Picture Editing... or selecting the contextual menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing... in the editing section; image editing you will find a tutorial on how to edit your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digitized; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by right-clicking the context menu and selecting the program from the menu from the opening menu. to do so, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data with you when you save the altered image. as a result, this information is lost from the EXIF- and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicode; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select the rotation. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you have retained the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo & digicode, it is moved into the garbage dump of & kde; postponed. F8 Image Delete Or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift + Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My Datumsliders quot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digikam; use either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be displayed in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet at the bottom of the calendar view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags are provided with a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or searching again.</seg>
<seg id="110">"" "when a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My Keyword lices; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">Tags are stored in a database for fast access and assigned cue in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword, and then choose new keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, this keyword will be substituting this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting deletion. if you delete a keyword, the photo will not be deleted itself. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and discarding it. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking and editing the keyword in the keyword menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot; My keyword; change.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click on the picture with the right mouse button and select as album preview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can drag them to the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and choose from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of key words. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to him. in this way, you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have a picture with key words, this will be shown under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Edit menu. the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-dependable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame you only have to click on the lower rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the bottom field you can enter a title and save your choice. this appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Encompassing all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next he search box is a small lamp the green becomes when the search finds matches. if you click here, filtering will be deleted and all images will be shown again. if the search did not find anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this, you can save a simple search box like the one described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as a search criterion.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your choice, press OK and search will be performed. the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you only have to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">When you select editing, the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information entered. if you select as advanced search, the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search. here, more rules are available for searching. for more information, see the Advanced Search section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digitized; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules will be added to the search group, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list with search group / search group. any option can be associated with others about the logical operations All..., A..., No... or At least... You can also search for type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitised; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop every image to find a similar one. by means of a swing, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere along the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and & digitized; find the right pictures. also here can be set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out or hold it and move it. move it while you move the left mouse button. press Ctrl; left mouse button to open a square. all images inside these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the bottom field you can specify a name for your Geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digipee; provides a lighting stand in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L The Lighthouse added from the context menu. the selection will be added to the light table and its window opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow tells you which copy in which window area you want to see. if you want to synchronize thumbnails from the toolbar and perform zoo or shooting operations on one of the pictures, then they are also shown on the other image.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you navigate pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison. now use the left mouse button on any preview image to see it on the left. this simplifies to work through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, normal delete actions also work directly from the Lighthouse like F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both thumbnails. this makes it simple for example to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function, which you can see on the crossed arrows. to swing the visible area of the image, you must click it and hold the & LMB; hold down. in the preview mode both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zooming works just like in other views. simply use the zoom control below the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos receivable, scans or stores digital photos takes a form of digital stock management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up, find, protect and use your pictures again. we focus on the digital photogravure procedures that & digikam. we look at downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital asset management takes up, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, confuses and exports contents which have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information on or a documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then you certainly don't use & digitized; the approach to save the metadata in a database as well as in the image files ensures very quick searches and a secure archiving that you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive, or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">The rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you make enough photos, then you will be using subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% of archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files do match together? the separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies backup strategy and migration. you will always know whether you are looking for an original or a derivative image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend to use the metadata option in the edit page of the metadata in & digià; to enable it. this ensures EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which? to do so, & digikam, provides them a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. of course, these are the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, since you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and set the value then. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now go with keywords, keywords, as you often call in other programs, or Categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">When you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digitized; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. reordering the tree within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different meta-data overlap. this is a very rough representation, as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to captions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want to let anyone know your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are surely interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer, then catch some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachets; in the French Normandy 60 years after the landing. wow! you begin to dream of having associations, memories, the historical time span is again present, you may even hear the silence. so the caption has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to generate an interest. if you show images you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the subject you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if an image is not perfect if it has the strength only with a label for itself to work alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized Alphabet (UTF-8), as a label. if you export your images in web galleries, then these captions are exported to your wishes in the caption and / or title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find in another city without navigation system? was it earth not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now running at speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities to use geolocation are innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your journeys using pictures with geographic information. & digikam; can also export your pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes practice to use copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information was stored in the setup page of & digitab; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author's line): linked to the author. this field contains the job description of the photographer. examples of this may be titles such as: employee Photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here, which offers the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculators can delete or change these metadata embedded in the image. this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique in each image. & digikam, will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failures, disk failure, current shocks, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread of superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you even with traditional paper pictures or negatives.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery firm in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">Of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archival quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers over gold coated DVD, & dollars; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by storing good disks and good recording equipment and storing them in the correct way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and control sums. despite this massive protection they aging through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For faulty CDs and DVDs, there is a convenient program called IsoBuster that apparently works miracles in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux, but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical Media: Blu-ray discs appear to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual player Blu-ray Disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu-ray Disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Do not forget to copy the data back to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep their statistics for themselves. their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic: floppy study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common fault cause, SMART fails to determine these errors. some of the SMART-detected errors can indicate the imminent failure. these are particularly read errors and shift counters. the expected lifetime amounts to between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be restored without any major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make a lot of electric shocks, it looks different on devices with computer chips and high speed processes. these can cause severe damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause scratched keyboards, complete data loss, hardware ageing, destroyed motherboard and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that a part of the energy heat absorbs and the rest grounded. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as this also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system ordered. if you buy a UPS you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its safety in electricity problems with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference when considering how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are, however, very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data via the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a common backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very secure from the point of view of data backup. data transmission errors are automatically cleaned up thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and distributed memory in the offer.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram shows the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are prone to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about this is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until one day you have to open a photo and this is destroyed for your surprise.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they create interferences within data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not currently affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard under a GPL incompatible license.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle created an own initiative with its trfs filesystem. this is still in Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for Linux; it is still not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss on notebook and 46% for workstation systems. notebooks already account for 50% of theft.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage than theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has not been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: false, theft, and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while technology develops further, there is a natural boundary for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristic for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deteriorates. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard disk today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected by data loss every year. so, backup your data after a plan and test this backup before making anything dangerous as installing your operating system, replacement of disks or resizing hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a bolt strikes you're lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane accident: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous enough for your data.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs to your neighbor's house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already said above is a common reason for data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files that should be backed up. it is a snapshot of no history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such a backup has been made. this backup will be closest to a versioning system except that it is tanned and is not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transferring scripts, rsync only copies the difference of the files that were really changed. this happens compressed and if you would like to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images right after you have saved them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">At the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further thinning should happen manually after which you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata in which image file stored IPTC data, associated XMP files, preserving memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 year, that is about the span in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to nature, you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate during time. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible. the fewer variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available to everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist printing capability for the ability to change a system in its size.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to grow on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc # source; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of mature if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task becomes easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard designed to replace the GIF. it can store much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bit per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there are relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend to store your images.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as a picture format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (default). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open file format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed due to the need to unify the camera formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to using metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers now available DNG and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource-block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits, since it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can lead to problems when linking between metadata file and image file, and as mentioned above, you should think whether you are using DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include working on architecture and modelling, discussion and collaborative work in DCMI communities and DCMI workgroups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and enlightening efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera edium, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing you can use external programs. if you edit the images with & digicode; edit it, you should add the metadata again. these have been truncated from the other programs under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright using a digital watermark. export them into web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digikam; in addition to adding a photo to an album, you will be able to add a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use & edit your digital camera; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">If you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not provide thumbnails. if this is the case, the filenames and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music etc. will be displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you might need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebar features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Rider Metadata displays internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer remark, GPS, etc. this information is the same as the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that these metadata isn't available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this invites all photos from their camera to a single album in & digi.The pictures are not deleted and we suggest you check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you don't want to download all photos, you can only select the desired ones with the standard selection methods from & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and then download Selected. the button Selected is grayed out until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, a new option is available. these images have not been downloaded from & digianymore. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the All or selected buttons, a dialog with which you can select the destination album appears in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is shown in the section My Albums. select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and & digitized; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by using the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, you will have to select them first and then delete the selected ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successfully downloaded into a & digi-; album before you delete them from the camera. if you want to completely delete the camera, you should do so via the camera menu, since this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use particularly meaningful names as file names. the file names are usually reused after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames if you load photos from different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been taken.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and file-based sub-albums. if you use this last option, you will automatically create a folder per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">During the transfer, three more options are opened before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two relate the data about the author in the standard Autorific section. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the Exif information will be copied into the IPTC fields. with the last option, you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want another date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix foto-% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the edit field. turn on the option Date & Time. for more customizations you should read the help of the command strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the camera filename option, you may have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters. or in capital letters, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, the & digicode; used for a photo, is displayed below the name the camera provides in the preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digikam; can use all information on the orientation of the camera at the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic turn is usually turned on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, & digitized; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to disable automatic rotation, use the Advanced tab and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was taken, you can use it to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, & digitized; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you have to turn this option on. use the Advanced tab and select the Date-based sub-verbs at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, you will see where the images should be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog for the camera appears. select the desired folder and press OK to start uploading. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmentalists, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser which shows the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicode; users wishing to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS Interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; do: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>

<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author's line: this field should include the professional name of the photographer. these can be names such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for provider: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the picture others & quot; offer. quot;. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC fields. this allows the metadata to be permanently contained in the image and not just in the database of & digi.The metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported into & digià; imported without going lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image descriptions as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images. note: for images that already contain labels, these are overwritten by the images.</seg>

<seg id="293">The settings of the illuminated table from & digitab can be set on this page to the default values. however, each time you open the illuminated table, these settings are switched on. however, some images have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you are using image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with a darker or bright color in the image. these colors are set here. in image editing, this view mode can be turned on and off using F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of luminance than in colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for further explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality as PNG needs a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">This reduces the size of the TIFF-images. this reduces the size of the TIFF-images. it does not affect the image quality, since the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With lossless JPEG-2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. as this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of & digikam, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing.</seg>
<seg id="301">When you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. if you use this option, solve this problem with a minimal loss of details. this option traces the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern using the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images that are burned, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights as a continuous white. use the setting colors to trigger some unusual results, since it displays the pointed lights in various rose tones. last, you may try to reconstruct some parts of missing information from the pointed-lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels in general do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digikam, and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or whites you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the Reconstructing option, you get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than the default 1. this can also be done later in the image options of the & digitile; image editing. to keep the time for the demo icing, you should proceed conservative.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaoning algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial data that comes from the color-filtered image sensor that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of colored pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA intercom or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">VNG interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm that was used by Dcraw. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a quick fix with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color softening correction since it is performed during the rough conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the colour information and gives instructions like this should be given again. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from a color space to translate into the other, so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions if an image is opened in image processing / Create color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folders Here you can set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the opportunity & quot; standard source; for your profiles to backend. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which do not include color-tmapping or gamma correction. currently, dscw gamma doesn't adjust for conversions at 16-bit depth. this means you have to change the color-mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it's quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them. unfortunately, not with Canon's models. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. naturally, this answer is unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension makes it possible to recognize the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portraits and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image editing. by providing this interface, & digitised; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will be removed from & digitised; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The slide show settings should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the picture transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes switch the metadata, respectively, which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the ad.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features on the left hand show a list of all cameras currently supported. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, trying to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in screen time mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and Firewire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use & digitize your digital camera, you must connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digitized; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after setting up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will be displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert all of them here.</seg>

<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digikam, you will find more information in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">You can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or from the context menu of preview and selection of the entry View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam, so you may not be part of your distribution. you may also find more information about the KIPI modules in the image editing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, displaying the file name, current file number, magnifying factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image editing changes your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using the Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you may need to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu or using the Restore button to restore image processing in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last save.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image editing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by editing the undo / restore function by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and note Ctrl; -Umschalt-Z for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you want to press the & LMB; pressing the Return or Restore button on the toolbar for a moment, you will get a contextual menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions will be reversed or restored in between.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started processing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, down image or entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter and zoom into the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen displays the picture in full screen mode. you enter the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can also change the toolbar. if you do not want this, you can change it in the dialog from & digitab; see the main window. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print image printing in the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print single images or whole sets. whole picture templates can be printed from your selection. you just have to select the images with the standard methods and select from the menu Album Export printer wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digicode; main window has a sidebar at the right edge that provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicking on the same tab leaves the sidebar to appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the caption view, you can insert or insert captions with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are changed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these limitations.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, either use the user button or switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sortations. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC-field Urgency. the code follows the scheme in the table below:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword view shows a search box to filter the keywords, the Keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords previously used in this digicode; -session used keywords.</seg>
<seg id="362">The Keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered search word. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is another simplification of entering keywords in a series of images. if you have typed different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keyword (s) can also be set by selecting the appropriate check boxes in the tree. all key words of an image will be keyword in the keyword IPTC keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the Keyword Filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyword Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keyword, and search views. if additionally one or more keywords are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also select and discard tags. suppose you have several images selected in the main view to get you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the above example, the main window shows the pictures on a calendar day. the Keyword filter is set to no keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword is drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be switched off in Settings miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or it, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can specify an advanced search across all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the grouping button. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? the free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adapted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a colorless workflow you can reach that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web are similar to those of your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the topic is on color management, everyone wants to know what buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should make informed decisions on each point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you can obtain the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are via e-mail or the web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you use another color space and think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB compared to the colors we really can see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent page and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to callibrate my monitor if I chose to work only in the sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour gamut or not, you have to collide your monitor, since sRGB outputs the circle. so when you work in the color space of sRGB, you must either callibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Compensation and Contrast Troubleshooting Automatic corrections try to make the best out of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the dente values over the entire image, so that the darkest dot is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similar: this method adjusts the intensity reactor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity canals becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the balance has very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Broaden contrast: this method enhances the contrast and illuminance of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a restart of all values in-between. this is only visible with balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted as a color space is worked with 8-bit per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can use the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it via the menu entry Color white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. preview is dynamically adapted to the tool settings. if you want to see the original image again, then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram shows that dynamic changes when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful there, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your results depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or dimming down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play a stat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default setting list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator raises the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result in the white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and does not have any effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">Save as and load the buttons. each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button reverts all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will also result in a different picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color-mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be used to consult the color management chapter.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to also save your settings so you can use them for more photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner will always make the same error and therefore you will always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful possibility to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digitised tool color effects provides you with four color effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, solar power, also called Sabatier, was an effect that arose when a partially developed pressure was replaced by a short flash light and afterwards the development of the picture completed. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photographic paper from the additional light.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase finally creates a negative picture that is not to be generated on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solar Energy effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so called & quot; Velvet aquire; effect. it differs from saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for a light-optimized reverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquoth; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The Neonfilter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the strength of the neon light. for larger images, the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photos. you can experiment to experiment the different colour aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors.</seg>
<seg id="418">Also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. all the changes you perform can be viewed in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mold gradation and the simple denser starch / contrast / gamma the tool is set to improve exposure. even if the dialogue with this tool is very complicated, you will need only the area of the slider for the application described here. more concrete the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three slides are clicked into and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the control knob and watch out how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right side, the original and preview of the image can be viewed. the preview is dynamic, based on the settings of the image, updated. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be used to indicate whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the highest for the dark tones, the middle for the bright notes and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma figures.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic alignment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the exit values can be used to create a hidden picture as background while something else is visible in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons you can save the set values in the file system and reload it later. this will use the Gimp level format.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input will be automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side shows half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. the following options are available on the right-hand side:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for images captured with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most useful. for images with large areas of constant color, linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker tones and that the corresponding image pixels are darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photo, a red marker is visible. if you move this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it then up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you have created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipettes buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. enable the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel, overexposed pixels are displayed, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect at the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shade and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The & digipee channel mixer; image editing is a tool for improving colour channels or changing the color gradations of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The Channel Mixer is another highly developed tool for mixing the colors of the images. you can edit it from the Color Channel Mixer from the image editing menu.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">Controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the picture will retain general brightness too, as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black-and-white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black-and-white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially if you mix monochrome, the reduction of a colour leads to a visible noise coming from the farthest. farbrauschen is made of small room artefacts that don't appear in the same place in the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel. if that is the case you can improve your Monochrome conversion by lowering the farthrows first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The storage and loading buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer settings you can save for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is enabled. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since colour images can be easily converted on the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good at all scene pictures and fits especially well with portraits towards the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at daytime. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepithon: produces warm, bright and middle tones while adding a bit of cold in the shaded tones. this is very similar to the process of unleaking a pressure and redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digicode; apply tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or the three-dimensionality of the texture in the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicode; adding tool frames can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photograph is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to set the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. the picture runs through a colored line, niepce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black-and-white images), shkantet surrounds it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a knock effect and decoratively adding an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specify the width of the frame in percent. the range of value for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be bigger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have previously used the tool After page ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into an image at any place. this is also possible in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text execution, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a half-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have selected for your text can be changed until you press the "OK" button. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed any more.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicode; apply tool templates, you can place a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to the template, simply send an email in English to the template; mailing list digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to put your templates folder in the dialog with the Share Folder button. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder updates the preview bar of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnifying factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink it: this button resizes the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole image, you need to shrink the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image lying under the template. to do so, take the image and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adjusted automatically to preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicode; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it does not sharpens a bit, it works rather psychoanalytically. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its use and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photographs without focus as well as most digitalized images require correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process must combine colors with minimal differences at one color point. this in turn results in sharp edges a little blurred. SLR cameras usually require more retrofit than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">Images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are using a follow-up filter during reading of the image. if you deactivate it, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening sharpness. you can call this with the menu entry Correcting Shares.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should use this carefully since the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also increases the noise. generally, the most useful technique for sharpening an image is the tool refocusing. you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than sharpness. use the tool to soften with the menu entry Correcting soft drawing and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp massaging is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried out first. an increase in the radius or the amount intensifies the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side of an edge. high-resolution images allow for larger radii. therefore, they should be better sharpened in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. this allows for a minimal difference to be applied to an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the fuzzy masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). blurry masking was applied with Radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicode; tool refocus refocusing an image by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted design filtering algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocused quot; in which it reverses the focus. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtr. refocusing mostly achieves better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Vienna Inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced even very strongly by the distant pixels. this causes undesirable results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most of the images, the default value should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in the correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values are 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">The filter can take values from 0-1. however, values are higher than 0.1 only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a good value is 0.03. a high value will further blur the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß'sche sharpness. use this parameter if your sharpness Gauß is sch. this is most often caused by a previously executed lack of blur. in most cases, you should use this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the gauss sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocusing parameter you set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before otherwise change the image. the reason for this is that many operations that are not immediately visible, but later leave undesirable artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you are reading and compressing images, eg. as a JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpness. this might be caused by the unsharp masking uses a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, unsharp masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Linear Filter. the FIR Vienna filter is often better for processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color image that has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital images you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The pad levelling stops the blurring of the area that has been darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink ink allows a modified colour for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The image error correction tool is one of the most widely developed tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the image. whereas larger values mainly smooth homogeneous regions and leave details sharp. a value of 0,9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening should be added subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="520">Exposure dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smooths equally in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD hiss will generate a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG artifacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. so set this value appropriately to the degree of smoking in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it smoothes. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 suffices here.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-range da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be chosen small. make sure that small angles generate a long runtime. so you should select this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step distance [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value of smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the highest quality you get by choosing this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to omit it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. correcting any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and get a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artifacts. the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a bad film storage during the voyage.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be removed successfully with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needed and can blur the image.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if it is increased, you may need to re-adjust the edges filter if you change this setting. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be maintained and noise or blackout occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">This value increases the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole noise can not be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically harder to smoke. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls adjusting the phase damping. this value redefines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used for that purpose. all noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction your life can change. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than to sharpen an image. use tool to soften the soft character with the menu entry Correcting soft drawing and experiment with the smoothness.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photographic artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for the restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, even far from compression in some areas. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; artefacts; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The buttons Save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and get a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button shutters.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can be restored like a photo with uniformly noise. the module is applied on a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures have been reduced to an old color photograph being read by a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts created by the scanner illumination and the photographic paper. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digicode; tool Hotpixel allows it to remove hind pixel from photos with a CCD camera in terms of eight have been removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression feature a built-in suppress for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; light Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image right after the image capture new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark to the picture to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the assistant will see the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Duration: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all faulty pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filtering method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square interface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubical surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitized; Vignetting correction is a tool for correcting the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area evenly. instead & quot; vignettier quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter to increase the necessary closing time in such a way that it is impossible to use the camera manually. wide angle lenses should also use an opening of f / 16 or smaller, as there would otherwise be discurring effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure range of today's film and the grayscale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter by applying a equivalent transformation on a rough image made without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation using a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the Vignetting Correction filter and adjust the exposure of the target image at three more points.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of fibre damping at the point of the highest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or by chance of a lens speed of 2, lower it to compensate for a small degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">You have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminosity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting Correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the Vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. an adjustment and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The fourth grade coefficient adjusts the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value checks the distortion of the second degree. negative values can be used to correct tone-shaped distortion and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">This value is stronger on the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most of the lenses, the 'Corner Parameter' has the reverse signifier of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus results in a correction of first degree. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Bright: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction of the barrel or cushion should be performed before any changes of the correction or size. the best way to do this is to correct this correction first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea edge or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you rectify a cushion distortion, the resulting picture will have black corners. you can remove them with the Zucutting tool in the TransGenerate editing from image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as images from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method used to simulate the GimpGuru.org web page that is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra feature film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview, you can set two parameters for film granulation and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the option Add film granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granulation and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared films, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The Filter panel is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film granules on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films like the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver granules of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grabbing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy look especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need even more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-filtering effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that edited the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digicam; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digicam; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel image is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines, which define the outlines in the drawing, are emphasized. images of whose gradient are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you would have chosen to sketch you. these would be good pictures to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digicode filter engraver shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The Filter engraver is a quick tool for reproducing your images with a 3D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where colour is not the most important part of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, equivalent to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the depth used is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is considered by blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Shaft blocks 2: analogous to the wavelengths 1, the picture here is distorted along with another version of blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button shutters.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom An sharpness: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a central point. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thereby creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurs the image by turning the pixels around a focal point. this simulates the blur of a revolving camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to go back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft-drawing blurring: blurs the image softly into the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Sharpness: blurred the image by a random shift of the pixels and thereby simulates the blur of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the ink in the picture and blurs it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button shutters.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. thus, it gives natural your images a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn copyrighted algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can stick with the & digitile; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirrors or turning to the correct orientation. the tools for this can be found in the Transformieren Turning and Transcoding Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Inflating photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to increase a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom in a picture when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you reinvent or guess the missing information? the Cimg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transformation size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Changing the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with better quality, try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in tab New Size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintaining aspect ratio: when this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it smoothes. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">"" "the" "" "Save As and" "" "buttons are used for this purpose. each insertion for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later." ""</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and move a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button shutters.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see an example of photo inflating below by enlarging a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you need to create with the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, you will see this rectangle as you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">You can change the size of the area to be clipped by dragging on the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply dragging it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The edit button of image processing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save in the File menu to save the newly cut photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview section, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After page relationship, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross-format width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting edge ratio using a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using inches, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio below.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the selected relationship and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the edit tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">Help to set up help settings so that you can compose your pictures better. these aids include:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic partitions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">The golden middle: the golden middle is a division that focuses on different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all possible things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who used to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is equal to 1: 1.618 the gold middle.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more fluid guides when you put together an image. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads to the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. this can be a line or different objects. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the gold spiral mentioned above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonals to place these lines can have a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you are using golden triangles to break up your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontally and Vertical options can be used to reflect the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the Color button you can set the color of the lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate a picture around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can fix this with the digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation. select Transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image will be shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse-cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a print on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have rotated an image you will find undesirable triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformieren cutting from image editing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is to cut the Automatically Scut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option flattens the picture a bit after the rotation. note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically calculated. on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New heights: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation into pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the picture is smeared a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double that strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adapted the perspective you get unpleasantly triangular holes at the corners. one way to clear this is to cut the image with transformable cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scoring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. a horizontal cord, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the bottom part to the left. this is not a rotation, the image is distorted into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shoot your image by rotating the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will appear to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two insulators produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing the image has beautiful triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transformable cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">The available formats hang from your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of picture formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats that are available on your system at this point. however, you will always find JPEG and TIFF under it.</seg>
<seg id="685">This happens based on the file extension and a comparison of this with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, the file in the image editing will be displayed. you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam; accept changes. see the configuration section for more information on this.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format to be used. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images. this reduces redundant information in order to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG for the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless if it is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw format, you can read on Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour. you can convert raw format pictures in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from & digikam; in the configuration section you will find further information about using modules with & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="690">& digikam; supports loading of raw images only with the dcraw program, which is included in & digi.The table below shows more than 200 file formats. all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by & digikam; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support recording short films. this clips are often stored in AVI- or MPEG format. & digikam, understands these formats and will preview films. & digikam, is not a film editor and therefore has no built-in possibilities to display or edit movies.</seg>

<seg id="700">Many tools you need the photo editing are included in & digitized; your description will follow here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image editing tools such as sharpness, soft character, noise reduction, refocusing, unsharp masking, & etc;. use a uniform dialog box to indicate the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture applying quot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertically split without duplicates. the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontal sharing without duplicates. the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the box to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the picture and drop it on the part of the image from which you want to see the preview. preview in the left part of the dialog is immediately updated.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The Properties sidebar shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. this data is from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>

<seg id="731">Further needed software: & kGraphics viewer; is a & kde; -program which requires the & graphviz; -tool & dot; for representation of graphs. requires in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in its own subwindow. initially, when you start & koloviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After you have selected one or more of the files, the main window looks like in the bottom of the screen:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or choose this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (up and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & old; key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been changed by another program, the following window will be shown:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be reloaded or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraph viewer; if you want to change your decision later, you can change the menu item Settings kdiagraviewer; set up..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you want to open a Graphendatei outside of an ongoing & koloviewer; instance, in the file browser or in the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & koloviewer; instance, or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a subwindow of the already running instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice durably, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical parties can be selected freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">When you use multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed across multiple pages without header line and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Renewal Load page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or let the program ask for each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of a graph viewer; specify a standard behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that every time it is asked.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives you the ability to specify the starting behaviour of & koloviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or decide to be asked at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which appears normally by clicking in the main window with the & RMBn, opens up more possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; -layout algorithms. entries, as described on the website of & graphviz, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">The algorithm sets the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few edge overlapping as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for non-lit graphs. it produces representations according to the spring spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a bounce model layout for unguarded graphs. it uses the Fructman Reingold Heuristics, and includes a Multi-Grid for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm arranges the knot circular according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; the & graphviz; algorithms provide special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Determines the type of graph (directed or ungrounded) and applies the standard algorithm for the particular type (dot; for directional, & neato; for non-lit graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this option is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Shows the What is the mouse cursor. click on a & GUI; button with this mouse-cursor to get further help to this element (if any).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available at this address and in the file ChangeLog in the source folder's base folder.</seg>
<seg id="759">& kGraphics viewer; is a & kde; -program that uses the & graphviz; tools for representation. it requires the following program packages:</seg>
<seg id="760">A special setup is not necessary to use & kgraph viewer; in the Settings menu, you will find more options.</seg>
<seg id="761">The main window of the icon editor is divided into five sections: the main toolbar, the bar for drawing tools, the status bar, the .color palette and the grid, in which you draw the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="762">When the current file has been changed, you'll be asked if you want to save the changes. after that a dialog appears where you can choose whether the symbol is to be created from a template, or if you want to start anew from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="763">Restore the last reversed step. if you have not made any progress, this function is deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="764">Inserts the contents of the clipboard as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="765">Sets the current icon in grayscale. this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of & kde;</seg>
<seg id="766">Does not change the symbol, but instead puts the current color on the color of the point you click.</seg>
<seg id="767">The status bar shows you the current actions. from left to right, it shows you the x- and y-coordinates of the current pixel, the size of the current canvas, the magnifying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol.</seg>
<seg id="768">Inserts the contents of the clipboard as a new image (if the clipboard contains a symbol).</seg>
<seg id="769">Open with Settings & kido edit; set up a dialogue with the three sides templates for symbols, background and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="770">With the buttons Add..., Edit... and Remove, you can change the templates for Standard File, Source File, Compressed File & etc.</seg>
<seg id="771">Select Transparent pixels or display rulers and display single-color: or a chess board as a banner. you can also adjust for the chess board the size: the caros on small, medium and large as well as the color 1: and color 2: choose.</seg>
<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides images and provides tools to read and store new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source like e.g. Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry images, a dialog appears which allows you to select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the picture. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears by replacing the default values ducrhe's own to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the scanning button. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed because some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image. here you can specify the compression and type of image file. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore creates very large files. you must also select or create the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots once you have selected in the Import &gt; screen shot menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear to allow you to view other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workplace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other working areas, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been taken, the dialogue options of the target image will appear with the options already described above.</seg>
<seg id="784">The KIPI module calendar currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="785">This module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K3b burning program. you can simply select the ones to archive. an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation. also the option AutoPlay is available for the Windows platforms.</seg>
<seg id="786">KIPI modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions. you can integrate additional menus, keyboard shortcuts and other skills into the program. you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program.</seg>

<seg id="794">The KIPI module Double images search is a tool for searching for duplicate images in your picture collection.</seg>
<seg id="795">If you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr allows you to share your photos with people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put your photos online and show your photos securely and privately to your friends and family around the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication. it is thus virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can register with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr's website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will see the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the exporting module is started to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module displays. at present, the module also does not support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button Photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, start uploading the photos to the Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords box can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during the upload process.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the Public, Friends and Famillie options, you can set the access permissions to your images. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the option Modify the size of the photos before uploading, the photos are changed before uploading in size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images. the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server.</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module Galerie-Export has no documentation currently. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic location allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF-keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools for locating geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization of correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want correlate in the main window and call the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to perform a possible correlation between time and location, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data taken at the same location at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which shows the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data is recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera mode. if the deviation below is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you don't have track data from a place for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add it to the pictures. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same place. since the dialog is the coordinates of one call to the next, you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set with the displayed map. to do so, select the region and increase it. always choose this region until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the map can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to mount the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The selection allows you to select all the albums that should be exported to HTML. you don't need to select these albums in a hierarchical way. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Appearance Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option For each image to create a page creates a gallery where each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture a new page is opened in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated pictures. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder with the name KIPIHTMLExport that contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, the EXIF information of your original images is also stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth you can change the default color depth. naturally, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnail allows you to adjust some of the settings from the Album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not automatically shut down. you can therefore read the program messages to determine if errors occurred during creation. the web browser is automatically launched at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and folders. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After startup, a picture is shown by default in full screen mode. this can be changed into a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless Module is a tool for changing images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases, as no compression of the colour information takes place. this can be found, for example, in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool so you can connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailing list for the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG codec module is a tool to convert a number of images into an MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG codec module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can insert a base image transition. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player.</seg>
<seg id="845">First, you need to select the images that should be packed in the MPEG slide show. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Diashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the Portfolio. there you can also change the pictures or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you are planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds to display a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. remember to trim the extension mpg if possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie by pressing the code. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now take a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back again.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that codes or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printing wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve you or print out with the Gimp Module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format to one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quotation from him is: do not expect dcraw to produce the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that should be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the Preview button, you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-color RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera operates in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information on your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you intend to edit your images frequently or later use them elsewhere you should not select the JPEG format as there is only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG image in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Run button. if you want to break this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which is the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite the existing file automatically. however, this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image size.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 dent): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation, the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): change of size in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent in advance.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the picture window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images via the button images. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images onto the picture list and drop it to add you to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">To remove images, remove the selected images from the list of images to send.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you just have to add the addresses and the subject here. the images selected by you are already attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure you don't send too many images at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails to send. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send a lot of pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The e-mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used each time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will have to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and the mail is enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG images in JPEG format and the original JPEG format files, then the original images will be added to the images to send.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is complete, the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages, search for errors. however, your e-mail program will start automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow a window will appear with questions like you want to show your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL transitions in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions by means of OpenGL. however, you have to have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">"" "the" "" "File Name" "" "option will show that the file name of the images displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation will be displayed." ""</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "Loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an infinite loop." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">Between the images, the temporal distance between the individual images can be set. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are over a dozen transitional effects between which you can select. randomly, any transition between images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During the slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous one and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current file name, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has no documentation currently. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module wallpaper is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have annotated your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & Photoalbum; Browse through them, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now entries in each group, i.e. in persons, places and in the group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have annotated your images and videos with annotations. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click on the entry with the mouse, the browser's view changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images are displayed on which both persons can be viewed. by this selection method you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, places and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view images of your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name. you can save with & kPhotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, which of course applies also to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the names, select the button on the right of the toolbar. in the context menu you can select which view you want to use for each category separately. this has the advantage that you can, for example, display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual. to do this, you will need to select the Picture Angle window (described in more detail) and select the category Editor in the contextual menu. in the View window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. this dialog can be viewed on the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the caption or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to be sought; the date can be either a part of the total data, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window you can search all images by certain names as you can see in the picture. here is illustrated by pictures where Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the home page of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & start photoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & Photoalbum; for the first time, or select in the menu help the menu entry kPhotoalbum; demo. then, some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & kPhotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this strip you can see here:. as the name says, this strip shows you data statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the previewed entries from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a range of timeline by holding the mouse button and dragging the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of this period will appear in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures. one is integrated in & kphotoalbum; the one is available as module (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version which you can create via the menu File HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas content, layout and target. in the following each area is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the moment and a description that should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-Example pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether you want to create a & kphotoalbum; export file to be seen on the overview page. you will find more information about the export files in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid information that is visible to the viewer even without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why they are not specifically dealt with.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this allows those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images which, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your page can change the resolution at any time that you have set. so it can search your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transmission time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this settings area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best of all, select a root folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, you need to select the main folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can select either a folder or a supported protocol, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser, after the pages have been created, will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you have created aren't yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, properly works you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all been related to root folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & K photoalbum; coming together, you might want to create your pictures with these. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you must work with & kphotoalbum; this work will not do again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all the images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold manner. first, it searches the images that are in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export menu...</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manually option to copy near the .kim file you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically move near the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images are already compressed with JPEG, and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want this anyway, simply select the option Export File compressed.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Importing... menu, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in the description.</seg>
<seg id="943">The importing assistant is four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the importing images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category person of the file personer to import (if you are a domain) while this category is in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the file to be imported and what categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and look at pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and see a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is shown.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) fixed information about your images, over (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and adaptability.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures. however, it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but frequently it also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can save with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where they want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; memorize the folder where your images are stored and use it automatically in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum; then start a different folder tree with images, you can start with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the User's Guide, the various settings are explained.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which you can call on the F1 key by pressing a button and click on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up full member groups, e.g. all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a mediglide as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">See the settings available to you for setting up the member groups. with the list listed above you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphic applications, such as digicode and gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and are not described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most of the modules have a help page, which you can access via the modules themselves.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together from several applications together, it may be that the modules have been tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using this on your own pictures The & kPhotoalbum; demo database can either be called using the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum -demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't tell me, I wouldn't have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & K photoalbum do not work. this is the downside when sharing features with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that use KIPI is that the other applications categorize their images into albums: here, an album is simply a folder. even if & K photoalbum; this type of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order by albums so that you can use the features with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, so all the images that show you the picture show at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, PhotoAlbum needs to be added; the modules also have a list of albums. here is a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & K photoalbum; s browser displays the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will be the category that you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you are using the category persons, you will do so, so do if you have selected people to view this and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are with & kPhotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select in the area modules which modules should be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you see an example of a start screen as soon as you get a photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you can see at the top a toolbar and toolbar. under the toolbar you can see the window with which you have entered your image database. currently, we will return to this window, but now click on the entry images to show you an overview with all available images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the ability to annotate each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons depicted in the image, etc. you can set each picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is mapped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing, as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by specifying characters, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is to relocate the images in the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can so that the used names are moved up, the persons find and assign.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the list to sort by date on the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected comments for each image individually, you may still want to edit all the selected pictures and add these images with annotations. in this case, simply click on the before and back buttons that are located under the thumbnail of the image on the upper right corner.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">In the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an overgroup. to show you that it is an overgroup, a special icon will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Commentary dialog context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new revision or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry to a category and place it there to make it an subcategory of this entry. attention, this assumes you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the upper edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... which provides you among other things the possibility to save the current setup and look of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you would like to see this window later, use the Options... and then hide / hide windows. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or of all images if you have not set any filter. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply pointing downwards of the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">When you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set up as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on an image, it will be displayed in the picture viewer. if you do not have a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove key or select Edit option in the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & K photoalbum; namely images even without having you stored on the hard drive. of course, you must have the images stored somewhere, so that you can record in the database index. in the picture you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right upper corner is cut are not stored on the hard disk. however, for images 5-9, however, thumbnails are present, so that you can preview these images. however, you cannot view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back into it. & kphotoalbum; so far you don't have to ask for the insertion of the respective CD. so, if you want to avoid trouble, how to avoid messing up your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Pictures menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end those who want to make you inaccessible and click on Current View in the Privacy menu. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may see and elect all except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This way you have set which pictures should be hidden in case of case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu entry images, so all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again displayed, click Lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to set a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply choose password change in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very secure. on the one hand, all pictures can be found on the hard disk and on the other, anyone who can access the file index.xml can read the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to take a look at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you spend all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in it. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it with your mouse and put it somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the picture above and down the picture. you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can let them run as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how frequently it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to fullscreen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you are using the viewer you can move in and zoom into the image. to zoom in, simply drag a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus key you can zoom in again The Plus key zoomed in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point button, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not shown zoomed. with the tie-key sets the zooms, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the single zoom operations work with videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the shooting functions from the context menu you can rotate the image. this is not working with videos. you can make comments to the current image with the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you may prefer to preview only the picture and see more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to develop the images on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while watching one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer has the possibility to provide images with features while you view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in you see a picture where the characteristics A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have set features on your images, these are available in the browser. so, if you have all the images you can edit, print or whatever you have selected, just put all of them at once with comments. this is described in. afterwards, you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview. if you wish to view categories in the preview window, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case, you will allow you to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The mixture is not saved with the image, but in the database. in the way you can reverse your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to stop the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select on the image from the context menu. to exit the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & knot modeler; you must use the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation to & Povray; should you have absolutely read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wire model views is displayed yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an object that is already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">With deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click on Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on the user or discard the changes with abort.</seg>
<seg id="1019">When you enter the path to & Povray; -User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When editing a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render only a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture mapping), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button, thereby changing the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a level of view as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the higher object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only when selected or their level of view is smaller or equal to the visible level of view selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& knot modeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window arrangement or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply switch between different configurations.</seg>

<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the attached to the right or left side of the view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over each other, drag the viewer in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the flashcards at the top of the views.</seg>

<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & krepvmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & krepvmodeler; version 1.0 does not support.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Rendering icon in the toolbar or select the menu item View Scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and the quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the menu View Render Modi... select the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to have a name that lets you see the features of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the size of the map, you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the picture, select the check box subsection and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the field of combination quality, you can select the properties that & Povray; for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diffuse reflection light. a detailed description of the render features can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called Anti-Aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this feature are better off.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of the super-sampling. adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling the neighbouring pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because each pixel is further divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel is split into 4 sub-pixels, which are individually pursued and checked for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is to reduce the generation of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you switch Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The final setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated using POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays have not hit an object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly ended, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; scene, select the menu entry file Importing... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently, & krepvmodeler does not yet support the complete scope of commands from & Povray; if error messages or warnings occur when importing, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray. this adds the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & cuvray models; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & knot modeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the Properties view, & cuvray; the & Povray; User documentation to the displayed object. here, set the path to your retention and the version. the versions 3.1g and 3.5 will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the Wire Model Views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more detailed wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detailed fidelity for advanced projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections. this feature results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you want to activate channel smoothing, the non-recursive antialiasing method will be used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more exact information about the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window configurations or create new window configurations. in the Window Decision section, it explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The drop down selector standard window arrangement: displays all existing window configurations. & krepvmodeler; uses the selected window arrangement at the start of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The Add-in window prompts show all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected order with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views for the selected window layout. new views can be added to the Add button and Clear selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The new column's position. with New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with card card you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and hovering the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & knot modeler; installed and now you want to start without more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this manual, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that as a result you will only receive a black screen. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should follow these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to render the rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene is in the dark and you just get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & krepvmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">To follow this tutorial, you must first remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">This is the view of the scene from the camera point of view. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the User Documentation to & Povray, you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change anything to the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you click the Apply button or click the input button, the wire-model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert Endlicher Centricular Quader) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& knot modeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the input button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire-model view now also shows the level, although at the moment only as a finite finite layer. if you render the scene, the plane extends to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the object properties view.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene, you should move the ground to exercise a unit below the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters. select a shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog box opens, in which you can select how the object is to be inserted. please select First object. the pigment will then be displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (Name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button Preview you see how the pigment now looks.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the Pigment Preview only shows matted black material, because you still have to re-enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with one click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the Quader and Sphere in the preview, click on the Apply button and then go to the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the Color List you need to enter two new attributes, called one-color. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more frequently, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, always choose colour-coloured and change the colors in the object properties view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step you should already be able to do as you should have understood the basic method of working with & knot modeler; the ball can be created just as easily as the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties you can immediately change the settings. set the value for the radius: on 1 (do not forget the input button or the user button), that the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the floor, because you have shifted the ground around a unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering now gives a weird result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have chosen the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already at the bottom, give the sphere a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First object and change the name, for example, in sphere Pigment. click on sphere Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finishing properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click on Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gloss effect and reflection result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal: not selected yet:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options are available to you & knot modeler. I hope you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional picture of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots the hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by each pixel in the scene. the Render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog have. thus, the scene pixel is processed for pixels.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered is a few light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you created previously with & krepvmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be stored under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Editing Unusual.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Save the current window arrangement and open a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & knub modeler; here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands preset for & krepvmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog for the creation of toolbars. you can add and remove tool symbols for & krepvmodeler with this option.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A dump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without modifying each diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file both for a dump map and for texture mapping.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& cuickshow; is a convenient image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images for viewing.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in fullscreen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very simple. the file browser lists files that you can click on the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in its own window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the Configuration - & kuickshow dialog, there are five flashcards. in three of them, General and Editing and Slideshow, you can set the mode of operation of & kuickshow; in the other two short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts for each window can be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color, which you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">This point activates, loads & cuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current image. this reduces the delay when you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option, & cuickshow; when ending the name of the last opened folder. next start opens & cuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if in window mode the window is larger than the picture, the background is filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; so set up that only a few of the file types can be displayed, which can also display the program.</seg>
<seg id="1140">With this option the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for larger images. this option is turned on as default setting.</seg>

<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use it as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, you can exchange scripts with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages enable execution of external programs and commands. in this way, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this purpose strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can also ignore events if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Enables the script to show the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok sets the folder to the folder where all the data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange shows that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions you could ask for more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu entry is clicked. to add an entry, you can use dcop Amarok script addresMenuItem (submenu). to remove an entry, use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; ends, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed to perform e.g. cleanup work. this includes saving data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packets with the exhaustion of amaroscript. for this reason, you should name your script packets right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining loadable modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file rights:</seg>
<seg id="1199">When your script package is complete, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; app. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus. you may also search for a very specific title of thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collection Browser and Quick search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">You might have some playlists but can never decide which one you want to hear? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if you still find it hard, choose dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has an excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. this and many other useful functions make Amarok the most advanced audio player. Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - just the right one to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually, you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">As & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should not have trouble with compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that can be activated or deactivated at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. details can be found in the System Requirements section.</seg>

<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually stored playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, will be used. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">To keep the current piece visible in the piece change causes the playlists window to roll up / off to keep the running piece always visible in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing parts to the context browser, it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is alluded.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can adjust the appearance and Amarok's appearance. the section is part of three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the usage of different fonts in & Amarok; by selecting Custom fonts, the otherwise gray represented section will be selected. you can choose fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows and context browsers. press Option..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the choice of Custom colour scheme you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selector activated underneath for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback when starting, that & Amarok; after program start, resume playback automatically with the piece in place with which it has been stopped at the end of the end.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to turn on the OSD. when using on-screen display, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings directly in this preview.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shade causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the OSD colors for font and background. a click on the color icons opens the dialog for color selection. if personal colors are not activated, the preset & kde colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input box displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to determine which screen of a multi-monitor environment the OSD is supposed to appear.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The flashcard audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field. some drivers still activate more settings in this card card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The collection card collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder that & Amarok; to search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, check the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes that & Amarok; Browse both the selected and their sub-folders to music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: enables & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes and Amarok; add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. then, the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The Part Incentive Database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination panel Driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup in the MySql subwindow is needed.</seg>
<seg id="1236">MySql setup is used to set up the database for & Amarok; on Calculator: enter the machine on which the MySql database is located. afterwards, the network port will be entered under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use Username: and Password: to enter the data needed to connect to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The load map.fm supports the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Enter your Username and Password for your Last.fm profile. if you don't have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the features and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok needs only the kdelibs package and no other KDE packages. so you must have kdelibs installed (including programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions, such as the OSD, require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause trouble for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org and also hang the broken file that caused the crash. after that, you can delete the file and create the collection again.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, this is because tagliar crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developer under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. the support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all libraries used by & Amarok have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; GCC 3.4, Taglib but GCC 3.3.X compiles, this will result in crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic switch off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail will automatically start with a crash). if it is a common crash and send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following perl script solves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARP [0] doesn't exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; get _ v2tag; print "Error writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\" unless $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2day, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok finds the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>

<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; appears only an empty playlist. how do music pieces come in there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left-hand side and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitive, the start-down window was converted to the statistic window. you'll find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the rating column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the playlist tab and select a column review. click anywhere in the new evaluation column to specify the review for one piece. you can also use the short commands Windows + [1-5]. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No. yes, this really is true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, so the real question must be: which media types are supported by GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support almost any audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! perhaps use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, which in default does not include MP3 entries (for patentwise reasons). the solution: alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, input key</seg>
<seg id="1271">Start the YaST Online Update and install the 'Multimedia Option Pack 1'. so... & Amarok; plays MP3's: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you to find the problem cause and solution. for GStreamer, you might need to provide a different sink (eg. osssink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you'd just listen to a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Either use the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with the highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEM codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. enlarging the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the arts driver, but instead use GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster arts codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use another driver (the xine driver has been strongly optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less dreamers react the visualizations.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, thaws & Amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all the components. follow register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok before!): - download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then execute all mpeg files once as a system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all the mpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with the latest-config / GStreamer-config) and run svn register again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1344">Context browser contains three subwindows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail. they provide information about the current piece to different aspects.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you may notice that the subwindow has dropped off. the information presented there is now divided into other parts of & Amarok; furthermore, the information can be collected in the Statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The subwindow music displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first area in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to find the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its rating.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display covers in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also show cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended Pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "among the" "" "Recommended" "" "pieces are the favourite pieces of this artist. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist." ""</seg>

<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to start playing immediately. you can also click with the right mouse button and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages with the help of scripts. once you click on the text subwindow, try and Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the internet. if no text script is yet running, you can choose which to be started.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required for this.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Artist - only grouped the top layer, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are sorted by artist and below will be a further division according to the respective album. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year for an album is unknown, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All records of your collection are alphabetically displayed among each other. the performer is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / artist - your pieces are first sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can adjust and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button, you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section of the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter is a selection box, with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. there are different time windows available, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year. in addition, you can of course also select your complete collection, whereby the filter is practically switched off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Right-click on an entry in the Collection Browser you get the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empty the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order into playback.</seg>

<seg id="1374">All pieces of this interpreter burn / Burn CD - This will then send the selected pieces to K3b and burn either as a data or audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit Metadata (for n pieces)... - Displays the dialog for piece information and lets you modify the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) move files in the trashns... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Record compilation - Changes a recorded album back into a normal album. after that the album will no longer be displayed under various performers but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes handling of many playlists very easy. among other things, it also contains smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. these utilize & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist containing the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">You can also create playlists created by yourself. click Smart playlist to open the dialogue to create a new smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for connecting & Amarok; for example, to use your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the top list view of the Media Player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired title from the playlist and drop it on the performer list. if you're done, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, finish & Amarok; and resolve the drive connection for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Among the toolbars is a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files will be hidden, which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, there is an address bar where you can pick music from an entered URL. if you type: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz, you can access music in the music file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping files. in this case, holding the Shift key can be helpful: as a result, dropped files can be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply dragging the entries into the desired position by using the mouse. once you enter the letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by whitespace, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one in two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">For example: one OR or two OR 3. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three (or a combination thereof) are found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then complete the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries contained by Mike Oldfield, but not after entries, such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you may also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, put a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR Frequency: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that include either Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-clicking on the entries in the desired order. the entries then receive a marking with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The playlist of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left, you will find the link you can add to the playlist. to the right, you will find playlist, empty playlists, and Random Miss.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly generated project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively, you can obtain a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project obtained using # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void, createFolder (Qstring name, Qstring parent) void addulls (Qstring parent) void addulls (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path, Qstring NewName) void set VolumeID (Qstring id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder test dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kAudio Creator; is an audio CD; -Read for & kde;. with it can easily be read audio CD; s read out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. other formats are possible depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudio Creator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard drive) and by many encoders that encode these wav files (compressed). currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (This encoding packages must still be added from the Linux distribution).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and saved in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also into other formats like the lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is very likely not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, only the Kodiver packages must be installed that are needed. if for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Welcher Kodierer gives a small introduction about coding, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudio creator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to crack any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device does not handle protection, it is not possible to avoid copy protection. simply avoid purchasing copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up needs to be done only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), it will subsequently explain the daily handling for reading a & CD; this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble across in the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or work completely without a network, with everything being recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. by step, step by step, you will find more information about how this program is used, as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD-data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must be made first.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder is configured in the code settings tab - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders so that the selection can be read with another encoder as the default. note that before the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the File Manager, so an already read file is selected to encode instead of a complete & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (like protocols, beeps) for program events (such as read out the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudiocreator; with various flashcards (like encoder, to set up the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho-acoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may have an easy advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate, the differences are less important as both codifiers produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is still provided free of charge with most distributions, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG gambling machines is available.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate app. 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a track. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR shared stereo, compression rate approximately 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or fetched automatically from the freedb through the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can hand over / needed with & kaudio creator; and the encoding program to create folder and file names as well as the properties of music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help with the encoder explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keyword (English: tag) when MP3s are coded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudio creator must be added. the result looks as follows: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database, in which people can read the audio CDs, the information can be downloaded / entered, so that all others can download this information instead of itself into the computer. it is to be noted that only text is spoken: & CD; Titles, artists, names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of translator: that is the author meant) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a bumble through one & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for using freedb can be used with another (fake) address than the one installed in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & audio creator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit at freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually issued monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">What selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know it more accurately, search the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see Note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done.</seg>
<seg id="1537">For the first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) can be found on the tab for setting up the encoding. other encoders can be added to this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for predefined encoders. for more information on encoders, please refer to the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can obtain more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console), and 'lame' must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reader experience on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this won't work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Did you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure about what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine as it is considered not completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into it with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something that will probably be done once and for all.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what each listing & CD needs to be repeated.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code to use for compression of the music (lame) and the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we divide the program to use the freedb to download the data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at any time reading a & CD; if the appropriate settings are found once.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program to read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, the effective device name can also be specified. if the drive can be accessed with other programs, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries in the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The flashcard general settings. here you can't do much. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left as left / keyed as shown in the screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information request information, so that you will be informed when information about generating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; -settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically downloaded via the Internet from a freedb computer.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the freedb server while reading the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. directory and filename is changed with konqueror- &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, dem & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you want to use the database before. however, if you want to use the database before. however, if you want to use the data in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know what data the CD should get? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to freedb.org and look for a mirror server nearby. on this track, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as there are many firewalls supporting the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80 because the & HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we do not want to transmit data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should be enough.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take over the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of concurrent pieces: sorry, there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one available drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, so try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: tick this to throw the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you cross this, then / must specify the path / folder in which the wav files are stored. this can be useful if only space on another drive is present. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter everything in the same way as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be straightened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later modification of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside of this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of concurrent WAV files: with a dualcore or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; finished. this configuration is used as a standard for any output of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create and setup MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was described in the previous section, as we are comfortable and the & CD; the process described in this section must be repeated for each outgoing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data obtained for a & CD; therefore, you will learn to insert data manually instead of retrieving them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try to find the & CD; this example. it's a 'special' issue of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, then the & CD; in the drive, which was defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, just like in the screen shot. this only when the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for the Help section in the FAQ section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the songs have already been filled out and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; a window is displayed, and you can select the database entry that matches your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic querying of freedb (on the page and CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you will need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 2: the CD Editor - Input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; corresponding to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "the artist no longer has to be entered in the" "" "Actual Title" "" "input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece." ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for the individual comments line size per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after successfully retrieving the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor (e.g. if all words begin with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we use only ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and on only 28 characters for the commentary area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio creator; this option is set on the encoding settings tab; take a look at the section 'Basic settings'.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files later with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encodes or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Just select an entry that obviously matches the style of the outgoing CD; in this example, this is not important as we don't transmit the & CD; anyway. for more information go to freedb.org website and read the information about categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you will return to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the current piece's fields.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are marked so are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece to or off. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the All items button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">By clicking on the selection button to read the selection process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is located in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window for controlling orders. the first piece is just read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message will show you if you are trying to work with a code you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and destination folders?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new record: assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into MP3 format. thus, read out and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has no configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. with powerful machines, the result is unclear. the used computer with an AMD64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read, while another piece is coded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is coded, a small window is displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you will need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is directed to people who compile from source files, and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help, how the program can be customized to your needs when it happens, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many different settings. it is best to read the step by step, for example, to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the various flashcards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first start of the program, without any clue how to continue from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start), or from an unusually short menu?</seg>

<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click the arrows on the left and right of the speed display to change the playing speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar, like pressing the button break or selecting the menu item pause in the menu item, interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; the playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use text, others use song code and again other both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically determined, which uses a song so you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke text. but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries in the Settings menu. the same function also includes keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarise. in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu item under the item Organize.... Click here on New to specify the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking to copy and then specify the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the entries in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection includes all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that when you add many pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it must be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song to the Add button. again, it appears to the file dialogue with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">If automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece will be automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then add the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the series from the submenu of the menu list of the menu Collections, the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order is redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next Song, the next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the Previous piece, select the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter since it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI-capable. in this case, MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all of the change patch to Bright Piano events into the events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are unfortunately no programs to create MIDI-Maps, so you need to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required replacements for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, it is necessary that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Default PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail to help me in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section, it is stated how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard, for example, does not support a gun (GM patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60) that sounds similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gunshot), it will patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and play the sound 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here is the term Tromp Patch of the patch, where each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the note represents the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"" "" "" "Keymaps" "" "are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. for example, take a look at the supplied keywords." ""</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on the N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap with the name name for this channel will be used. if you use the Keymap option, all occurrences will be ignored, which attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The option ForcePatch can be useful, for example, to always use the percussion patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBender Ratio announces in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if an MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender occurrence with the value n, it is converted with the n * (r / 4096) and then relayed only. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM records that a keyboard, which receives a pitch benefit event with the value 4096, will play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two sounds up to one octave. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid; try around.</seg>
<seg id="1677">"" "to use a MIDI-map, simply open the" "" "MIDI Settings" "" "dialog. this can be found in the Settings menu," "" "Midi" "" "settings." ""</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list, where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings on the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The tempo change shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can result in two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This may happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (e.g. by kmid; 's homepage)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, therefore, supports & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key on the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on one & kde; - Desktop a & konqueror; - Windows with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a karaoke file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file).</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, switch the automatic addition to the collection, and the new one; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.G., B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so you set the automatic addition to the collection and open Amid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play with Bmid and C.G. and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this encourages me to continue programming.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; Laga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga. at the moment I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Laga.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files if you have a question, an error or an idea for an expansion of & kmid; or even if you want to make me simply happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arracis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will be among friends of & kmid; list (if you want to). before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have & kmid; completely written in my spare time and doesn't give money to anyone for it. I would like to stress that I'm not programming only because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also is Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the AWE support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Magnus Pepa, Thorsten Westhoder, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error notification or even a supportive email.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you are using an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you have to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you had a sound card except that you can of course not listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and ffmpeg. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or phonon formats, as well as to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & cappname; was not yet finished as & kde; installed on this machine.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the website The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; user mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only appear when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save preferred links under the Bookmarks menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchical level. if you select an entry, his group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback will begin with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the different files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / folder can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you have to select playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and changing [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during start does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be disturbing in the end animation, so the user can finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite picture: & lt; smilgt; & lt; body; & lt; img dur =\ home / mum.gif "fit =" meet "/ lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; /;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuration of MPlayer in the configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the Toolbar of KMPlayer. here the output of mplayer can be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog from & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, just like setting the backend per mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & KMPlayer; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the player to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. the started process is knurlayer. if there are no mistakes here, the backend issue is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that always a given backend for a certain mime type is taken (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog can be used in the settings under - &gt; Quel- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. the encoding must be detected (e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also supported only on the first screen (: 0.0). therefore, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Various names are used internally by KMPlayer. at the time of the origin of this documentation, dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, vcdsource, vcdsource, vrsource, source, source, source, vcdsource and vrsource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hint about how I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is run as root after connecting the device. it is absolutely safe to make sure / dev / cdrom is on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine only starts slowly, why does every time my CPU have to be checked for its performance?</seg>
<seg id="1734">Note: the answer is outdated. kxineplayer automatically needs the last saved value, only the first time xine will check the CPU.</seg>

<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font size. if the font size is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the source code above has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is to use the menu building or the quick assembly button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be stored before compiling. & Kile; does the storage automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using fast construction, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, it should also be considered logging.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few places should have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} would then allow the opening of the font in the surroundings (Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are provided solely within the environment (by\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no limitation (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and user-friendliness of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold, cursive, undercuts, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the\\ end command or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics printing and is available until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a phrase can be italic italic with\\ emph {word} italic.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex; markup language was presented, now follows a step-by-step instructions for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text has been entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made for the better legibility of the document. at least one quote, a few passages in the fat and italics print and a poem are used to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor-View or Ctrl E can return to the Editor again (with the internal viewer). with an external viewer, its window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format. these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed by file printing (in viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar allows the conversion of the DVI; file into other formats. once the DVI file is created from the & latex; source code, the transformation into desired other formats can begin using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview mode allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers an appropriate setting for all & latex; Binding files. to do this, simply set up Modern under Settings box... Tools to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the preview search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source code and then clicked on forward searching. the jump to the appropriate place in DVI; viewer is then performed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece, with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -document from & Kile; opened and bound to the corresponding line. to do this, & quot; in & Okular; to be specified as text editor.</seg>
<seg id="1796">If the quick installation of the & DVI file does not open, a fault can be present. if an error is present, this is summarized in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file tells the source code source code. in the editor the buttons can be used for predictive LaTeX errors and other LaTeX errors for sprints between errors. the logging file always indicates the line in which the error appears. to view the flawed line, it must be clicked on the error in the logging and & box; jumps to the flawed line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template to be used for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting a blank document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard can be used for the quick creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for nearly all documents. templates can be created, saved and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file needs to be open or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document with a new file, some strings are replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings cases... settings General set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by typing in the document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the resulting entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; a simple way to create a template should search for a template found on the Internet and the steps below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and emerging from many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & Posters, and its possibilities, the manual should be consulted to Kate. users of & Kile; can begin there directly by reading the chapter working with the editor of Posters.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very convenient & latex; command reference, which can be called for the LaTeX reference menu. it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands which can be found in & latex; and their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-clicking with pressed Ctrl button to select the & tex; that means that in this way, when clicking on\\ par,\\\ bigskip, just\\ par will be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with the left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the most different kinds of source texts and emphasize them. for example, the & latex; -statements from the normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by a different color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many Wizards can add additional jump marks. this is a special kind of bookmark inside the text. the menu entries do the jump marks or the respective keystrokes allow the jump to the next or last jump brand.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the key aspects when using a program like & Kile; Even though & kate; already excellent options have been added to & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; & latex; always support many environments and groups, and therefore support & kick; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Select a complete paragraph (group of lines containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">This selection also has an extended meaning as this command also selects & latex; -commands with a back-back character (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key. & cade; provides the Key Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. & box; provides with own commands for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands to delete the text are included:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & box; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further orders under Edit surroundings for an easier work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">With this command, jumps to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to save the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jumps to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested environmental commands, the overlook can be lost quickly. this command buys the last opened environment so that the nested environmental structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also provides special commands for the & latex; groups defined by brackets {...}. under Edit tex group are a few important commands that match those from the Edit environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command jumps to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jumps to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly locked clasp.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is located before or behind the sharpened bracket of a & tex; -group #, jumps to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested graded group brackets you can quickly lose the overview over. this command buys the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple receptacles are used as gates. for the useful implementation is used in & box; the character 'is used for two simple quotes. also for the ending of the appropriation the character is' used. & Kile; knows this case and for two end-to-end quotes for & latex; one.</seg>

<seg id="1843">Command mode is not necessary for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters to be entered with\\ begin and the call of the completion mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & crunch; a special mode for the completion of the environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When you call the Save Mode menu or the Alt + Shift key, the command will be automatically added to the opening of the environment and it will appear\\ begin {. thereafter, the ambient will be continued in the simplest way and will be finished by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this has been completed, the environment will automatically be closed again. as soon as & Kile; recognizes that it is a Listen directive, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>

<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus; invite, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the tapped in & Quantaplus; the plug-ins can be used in a large number of & GUI; more about it below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we begin editing the Edit menu. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog allows you to manage all of the plug-ins and add new ones. we describe each and GUI; element in it:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location you use and quantaplus; this path for searching the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Often on one project several people work in a kind of hierarchical relationship to each other. & Quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift + F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member may have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and subproject leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of one's own identity are important with regard to news and annotations. see for further information on notes.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is a further advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event for information to the team leaders can be created when something is happening. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project, so that later, how much someone has worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script inserting a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">On the side event configuration of the Shift + F7 Project Properties dialog, events can be created, edited and deleted.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An email is sent to the addressers selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Notes are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by the following items:</seg>
<seg id="1943">You can either select the comment entry from the editor context menu or input the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">In this case, the syntax @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), with nickname of the chosen nickname of the team member, is a role in the project from the following options: team leader Subproject Manager After the area and subproject leaders, the respective area or sub-project names should be mentioned as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but spaces around the parentheses and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages that is DTD agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>

<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for the detection of different types of files. using the Standard Restart button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the coding of newly created or otherwise than files opened with file opening (where the encoding of the file can be skipped). however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Default DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting is removed from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; produces backup copies regularly so that in case of a power failure or crash during the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source text at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1966">In the Structured tree settings, the visibility of node in the tree, the updating frequency of the tree when working and how deep in changing the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty knot are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element was found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The setting of abbreviations (a type of templates) that can be unfolded when editing to larger text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means there may be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause abbreviation means something else than in a group for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins are part-applications from third parties, which can be re-used by any part-enabled application, the most known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plug-in at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "Only-Read" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-read-parts typically refuse loading if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, then testing & quantaplus; whether the entered information is correct. deselect allows saving the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it shall be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. the support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) Debugger was set, just like the support for the DBG Debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, the support for using & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">The use of the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger Plugin Option, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all stops are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is displayed. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to debugger if necessary, or it tells the plug-in to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened, which uses a debugger, so that normally it doesn't have to be paid.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to launch a debug request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and constantly sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a debug request is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script, without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues. happens before a debug request is given, the execution starts as soon as a requirement is placed.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where it is possible to clean up in functions and include files.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the instruction and go to the next one as if there weren't the current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you & quantaplus; can adapt to your needs and how you can and quantaplus; help to become better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type Editing Packets (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for brand and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes from & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages and / CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the Tag file and the toolbars. tag folders contain two file types, the descriptionrc; and TagXML files with the extension .tag. tool bars are handy, symbolic guiding of image buttons (above the editing window), which could include text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or automatically created from an existing DTD. see for details on the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how TagXML files are to be created, then the descriptionrc; and also tool bars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and contents of the property dialog, the & quantaplus; for the day shows. the descriptionrc; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; self. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of writing errors.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folder. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders bear the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information about working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than just-element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when using it, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Only valid for the class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only Family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only Family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only be used once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of attribute. additionally, there are other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a just-element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that group together the elements of a list. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specify the position of the attribute text within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single-element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; declaration: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the top of the & quantaplus; to start Windows and select checking tag XML. another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available. currently, the check is only performed when loading tagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In the following example, for a family 1 tag XML file. this file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; scheme. the file name for this tagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following example, for a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file a & PHP; Superload function is described. the file name of this tagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tags &gt; & lt; tag &lt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "function" returnType = "function" returnType = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tags</seg>
<seg id="2024">The descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it accessible via DTD Editor DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = Change 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD input. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as a nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can set actions... to be created. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User-defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with K1 the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the settings and when the action is executed, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but then it is not restricted), which change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & Quantaplus; themselves are the Quick Start dialog or the different See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myNavige.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as sh% scriptdir / myscript t.sh. To find the script at the following locations: $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / scripts in its path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current and quantaplus; only one instance runs the text unique will be added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document, or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script input from & Quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined, which is to send to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful for this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, to the default output run. it can be specified, what is to be done with the output written on the standard output, by setting the value the selection field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create a toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add the day to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning its use, enable "Edit Tag dialog" if available, so you can enter the action when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? do we replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kido edit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics Other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">In view of the start of the tag, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually described as loose, fixed, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user should be signaled that clicking on this icon will be started; -tag in the current document will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol it has to be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selection of the desired action. next to the text field is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators in several groups. open the toolbar to set dialog over Settings tool bar. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">After selecting the item you want to add to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might think that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by using all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Secure in the right folder. after newly created XML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & Quantaplus; for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create one & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you might check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done this for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first, you need to look for an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = functions.html Section 2 = Section1.html Section 2 = Section1.html Sec2.2, # Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Section1.html tag1 = tag.html tag2 = tag.html tag3 = tag.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation such as:</seg>
<seg id="2062">Documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax,...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of box (except reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces influence nothing, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that serves to shape the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation should be displayed for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate contextual elements to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (as you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that they are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich but proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the different resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with promotions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places, there is an e-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) to send with Email, send toolbars tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all others and quantaplus; users can download them. the contributions will be checked and only made available if our team takes them as correct and useful for publishing. in order to contribute to this, we recommend to sign the resources for which it is a GPG / PGP key.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for their private GPG key after their passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New Resource you need to fill in the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD DTD package (DTEP), upload tool bar tool bar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripting tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signification. in the event of problems it warns and it can then be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work on XML-languages that are currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag-files in tagXML format might be necessary. there's the easiest way to convert DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Convert a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. after that the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Destination directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / quanta / dtep folder.</seg>

<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to get full benefits from & quantaplus, they must first introduce themselves to these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory, so that only this user can personally use them.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; -patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emofrees the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree view, the file-tab with information and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the file leader with the right mouse button to get a context menu with current document appropriate entries, such as close the current, other or all file frontrunner, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or version of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the edited documentation contents, such as basic processing steps (cut / paste / paste), edit the text under the mouse-cursor or open the file when the string is labeled as a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as default for which a set of toolbars is displayed. in the course of further expansion of Tools, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; paste it into your document, then click the tag that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The construction views (QIT;) enable to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and roam them. in the presentation with file operators are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouseclick. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage medium can be performed with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; All possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects are only usable in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of breakdown in Global, Local and Project also works here. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the information available to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands opens with reference to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, some attributes and namespaces can change. the entry system oriented to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packaged documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added, edited and viewed project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two file fronts at the bottom of the window that can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all DTD changes are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & Quantaplus; -scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & Quantaplus; toolbars are extensively expanded and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function from & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & Quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar Archive via & kmail;. if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can save it to & quantaplus; like any other back up and load!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the configure script; autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are simple to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting with & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that there is no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH before its bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a multitude of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML, editor, the developers of & Quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a stand-alone, extensible Markup Languages editor? well, this would make it the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer confined to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good use of free software, the idea of why developed what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, & quantaplus; to extend as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">With self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automating almost every task is possible. through the program Commander, they can extend it without having to memorize any script language syntax. (read more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast Web development and was quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; type, or helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffinity Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, with the oldest entry removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. check the section on Templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard, converts special characters to & HTML; description, so that they are displayed correctly and not misunderstood by the browser as a formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Convert the text from the clipboard in & URL; Note that is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Disables the selection of blocks. this allows you to select text blocks with the help of Shift + Shift.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Goes right to a line number. this is very helpful if you & PHP; script outputs error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Search a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of the script actions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Disabling and switching the porter on the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter gets activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the columns to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the filename of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -projects are stored with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example, to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Downloads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, how & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & Quantaplus; -Projects, you will find the details explained.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Create a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be set up by setting actions... they are stored. tool bars are stored for toolbars, or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbars to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is present in the next release).</seg>
<seg id="2137">Allows the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else has made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE directory, the store fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags attached to the currently loaded toolbars. if the standard (HTML) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting using tool bar is denied if this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the above-mentioned menu points. click on it. clicking on a activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the Posters; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; with the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, changeover may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will activate the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar display on the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specify the behavior of the editor window. in the Documentation of Posters, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add them and modify the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the mouse cursor's environment, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they will find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled out from top to bottom, since, for example, after completing the project name, the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">By default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you are processing local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.com) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment might be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to go differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Let's check if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be included. if a project is started from scratch, not hooks.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option all files and folders are displayed inside the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clip from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project project properties in the menu tree in the subwindow Profiles or Shift + F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders may be possible), which are rewritten for project related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This means that the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles subwindow, high-loading profiles (see in) can be set up, as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile, by showing one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the subwindow team configuration, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, event actions can be turned and these actions can be added, altered or deleted. event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs, such as the backing of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, it opens & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the toolbar. the dialog project opens and allows selecting a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing opening and opening... in the right-click context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Different profiles can be selected here. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if only one profile exists, the button is faded to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forget about programmers. this option is useful when there is a need for frequent upload of files and the rather uncertain password saved on the disk -option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog, if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-loading profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialogue is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the server name on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so that it cannot be read easily, but anyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened, or deleted in the project toolbar or the project toolbar, accessible via the Toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of Quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity but also allows adjusting and adaptantaplus; to their own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars are stacked in & quantaplus; the best way to customise toolbars is to add and add toolbars. adding tool bars will be added at the bottom of the Add Toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and symbols can be set either with context menu (right-click on the toolbar) in which new action, a new toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbars rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog where actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries are additionally removed and action processed that are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings... and set Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & Quantaplus; uses templates as a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you imagine for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some templates with & Quantaplus; included templates have conditions for their use. please read the terms presented at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created by any type of text document. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents will be created in appropriate subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in the appropriate way to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be included in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can include everything from a comment to a final note to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure grouped together in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Design a document structure as you wish (XML;, & HTML,, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As Template As Local template save....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree at project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can easily be dragged and dragged onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file into a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag and drop or insert over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files, select a name for the template and back up. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. they can pretend headlines and footers or dynamically interact with & PHP; design, insert or associate with them. in addition, you can keep a few things in mind when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">Template structure in subwindow templates is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / .kde / share / apps / quanta / templates. each folder corresponds to one of four types of container, as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder in the template view, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is faded as soon as elterial attributes are haunted.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template view. if a root folder were set so it would generally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text block. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers by copying content templates to a folder with special header lines / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show right mouse button) over a full command collection for adding folders or copying and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; Editor and VPL; & sourcecode editor accessible via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second tells the editor window in two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL file editor works as follows: it downloads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; -page and a cursor. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor if necessary, in which the implemented changes are visible in the VPL; editor in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">While working with the VPL; editor in a document that & PHP, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit it, the source editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are visible both in the source editor and in the VPL; the editor is active in the source code editor and in the VPL; the editor is already active. pressing F9 will enable this mode to move the active cursor from one window to another while keeping the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The Synchronization interval between the VPL; editor and the source editor is adjustable via settings Quanta. after choosing VPL; view, one can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small span for fast hosts and a large span for slow ones.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming that you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to choose tool documentation. this allows you to edit invisible tags when working with the VPL; the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the manual encoding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons down. a click into the list allows changing the content, e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key word2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of creating pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS stylesheet by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Cursors are possible, like in a word processor, by moving with arrows. in rare circumstances the cursor behaves peculiar. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing keys and deleted using the back button or removed button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way over the toolbar, as in the source editor. it should be noted that inserting tags will not be removed previously, e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, must be removed any other anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the Sheets Assistant or the Listen Wizard are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release the tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for analyzing style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; successfully compile, do not need the libraries libxslt, libexslt and LibXML, which are already present in a typical installation of & kde;</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & how difficult;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & knu3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later, lots of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparison and merging of folders. this function turned & knu3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two people work independently on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & knu3; while automatically selecting the correct changes. the merge editor under the differences windows allows you to edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& knu3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screen shot shows & knu3; in case of folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& KL-diff3; displays the exact differences and resists the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently have to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabulators are displayed visibly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can simplify the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 -o target folder with diff3 folder 1 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog allows you to manually type file names, select the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will tell your selection and will show it next time. you don't need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences is done with two files.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By clicking on the Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparison and merging of folders will be introduced. however, if a file is selected for A, then use & knu3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merges are checked, the input field will be active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately set an output file. you can do this later when you save it.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting to merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & knu3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in opening dialog, you do not have to select any files, you can simply close the dialog using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag & drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; download and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you can't remove anything from & knu3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program to cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while over the line. then a small help window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, the color indicates which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's good in the next section (merging) well.</seg>
<seg id="2306">When differences are found, the color displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in character strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file doesn't have lines. if the line break is activated, the line is dotted with broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the reference windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [changing] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the sprinklers to find next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison windows are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, by automatic merging or manual editing, no more line is left in the group; then the text & lt; No line in the queue is displayed. this is only a wildcard in the event that you change your mind and perhaps again insert another source. this text does not appear in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: when selecting the sources ignoring the options or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">When you click in any of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, down, side on, side, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl End, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in any of the context columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Strg-bottom / Strg-above), to the next / previous conflict (Strg-picture upstream / Strg-picture downwards) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the marker to the clipboard, you must copy the copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl insertion). if this is checked, whatever you mark, it will automatically be copied to the clipboard and manually copying is not necessary. however, be careful with this option because you could inadvertently overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + line feed\\ r\. Katten3 does not retain the line ends of the source files, therefore you should use & knu3; also not using binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files are saved automatically when loading, and restored at the next start. (menu settings - &gt; Katten3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog provides variable width fonts, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences in italic script will be displayed. if the chosen typeface does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be scastened. on these systems, the preset button automatically adjusts an unaltered color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, pressing the tab key will insert the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise, a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will be automatically used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. the manual copying to the clipboard is omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line you prefer to save. the default value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The second step compares each line. in this step white characters will not be ignored, even when merging white characters will not be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, while others may only look identical to a newline '\'. if this option is checked, the carriage returns will be visible, but like a white character. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and related characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensive search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled by default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow for very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">"" "in" "" "Automatic" "" "mode, this setting determines how long the results of the selection will be shown before jumping on to the next unresolved conflict." ""</seg>
<seg id="2335">Solves automatic all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments if the options Ignore Figures or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge operation. see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not apply to the current program. you must & knu3; quit and restart to make the change active. (this option is in the KDE version of & knu3; not available because the language there is globally set via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following code settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the top setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the selection fields for coding a brief note appears what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Customize the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files can be compared and merged with different coding.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessor commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of preprocessor commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Disable this to suppress changes in white characters in the text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options Ignore Figures or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences will be displayed in a color coded oversee column. however, sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the space available on the screen for long lines. just stop the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arrange the comparison windows side by side or overlap. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then decide to merge the files. merge the current file in the merge menu even if you just compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is handed over to this external command. in & knu3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that exactly meets your needs. you can use this function, for example, to cut out troublesome pieces or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal preprocessor command has been specified (see above), the output of the command is used only for line calibration. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to give the user greater flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases used or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessor command for line synchronization to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 in the appendage string refers to the found text in uppercase letters. the\\ U converts the found text in uppercase.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). they all follow the same pattern $keyword created $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Katten3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line sampling. sed's / [0123456789.-] / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several placements at a time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the placements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER 'However, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor is maintained for displaying and merging. other operations only change the data that the line interval algorythmus looks.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you inadvertently ignore certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often, programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders in recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions with either all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to the comparison and merging of single files. you just have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 will be used as the base. if no target folder was specified, & knu3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not the merging. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, you will be informed of a small message window about the current progress. if you break the scan of the folders, only the files that have been compared until then will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is complete, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during scan is represented here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually displayed collapsed. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories can be opened and all subdirectories can be opened with which you can open or fold all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the Details Pane to the selected object. in such a case the merge operation cannot be selected automatically. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirtiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then turns yellow and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. A folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. A folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, the merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode for syncing is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option directory is synchronized. then selects & knu3; the necessary action from so that afterwards both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B; directly after merging & knu3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New File instead of merging (unsure) is checked, then examines & knu3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, the merging of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging a file is executed after the other. the status column shows ready when the merge operation was successful, and correspondingly different messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is complete, you should make a final check and check if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file-like method is selected Full analysis, KDef3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the selected entry (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you have not specified a destination folder, C will be used as the target in the Three-Folder-Merge mode. B is selected as the target and A and / or B will be used as the target for synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries should be in the folder structure, even in the folder structure. there are some options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). to merge only the current entry: select action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid merging actions exist due to conflicting file types, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog box with the options through, Simulate and Cancel appears.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you just want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& knu3; performs certain actions with all entries. if manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you're done with a file, select start / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then & knu3; its work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you decide the cause of the problem. if you continue the combination (F7 key), & knu3; give you the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before you continue merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, it remembers & knu3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them at the later compilation of all entries. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered to be completed. only if you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & knu3; (Settings - &gt; Katten3...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; valid placeholders: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would be ignored by CVS too. many autmatically produced files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems, a previous point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is turned on, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links will show. this is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folder and recursively searched. (note that & knu3) does not check for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would result in an endless loop and & knu3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of dissolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and essentially slower when applied to files that contain no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the change date and the file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain level of security. please use caution with caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of modification, there is no real comparison. the files will be considered identical if they are equal. for example, this can be useful when copying the change date. please use caution when copying. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no target folder was specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the more recent file will be proposed as action. (this is considered unsafe because it is provided the knowledge that the other file has not been modified.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and receives the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also applies to the normal merging of single files, not only the merging of entire folders.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the merge-merge-view stays visible to merge single files; you can move the window-divider with the mouse. if you don't want this, you can switch the option Directory & Text window to switch main windows in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also merge a single file directly, without having to start the folder compilation. to do so, you can merge a single file directly from the merge menu. once you save the result, the status will be set to Erleur and the file will not merge again if you start the folder compilation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you re-read the directory: directory menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDB3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders for opening, located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive using a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">One URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be escaped. (# - &gt;% 23, spaces &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then a file is always assumed as a link target. (FTP: sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date differ from the original. (note the option of confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is now as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start Katten3, press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then select In KEN3part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally needs & knu3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a part, it takes & knu3; assuming that the input file is a patch file in unified format. at least one of the two files must exist. then starts & knu3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu Preview in - Katten3part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the patch file has been created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & knu3; run as part, it only supports comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the Part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDB2 (now it's compact) already exists. furthermore, the name Katten3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and have learned a lot by having looked into the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone that path or are going to go that way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file, you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will first be treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character differs, the line will be treated as not identical. if similar lines make next to each other, this is the last but more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source and selecting the A / B / C button. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort for this was too big so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing the text, suddenly it is lt; No src goes; the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& knu3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild web. many thanks!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & knu3; you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how you can use KEN3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the latest changes can be found at http: / / kdef3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder der & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir sets the folder in your system in which KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & knu3; autoconf and automake use, you should not have problems with compiling. however, if difficulties occur, please report to the & kde; -mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position and replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, after changes to these options, you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the target folder when merging. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (behavior will likely be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on any of the buttons, the lines will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default this option is disabled. different characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual workspaces. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, quit them, or move them. this works both within a desktop as well as several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can view all virtual workspaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the motion can be moved both inside a desktop as well as to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: when clicked on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries Pager set up... and exit. if, however, on an application inside & Kpager; clicked, the symbol and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, maximize, on desktop and exit.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, you can move windows inside & Camp; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is enabled, in the & Kpager; the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Cross this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual workspaces. if it is ticked together with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1. work Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is enabled, the running programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap shows a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; -main window can be determined: classically leaving & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, like from pager applications in some other Windows managers; horizontal shows all virtual worktops in a horizontal and vertical row in a vertical row, which is very good for displaying sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, view the windows as symbols or with their contents and move. in addition, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog settings to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi. if you do not have a write permission for the file, you must login as a user root or contact your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you need a working installation of the basic KDE packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for various users: artists, web designers and people with visual impairment. this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag; its.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended with new functions. it is optimised for use on powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & mag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. below, this window is referred to as magnifying windows. the image shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">The default setting expands and Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a moving loupe. alternatively, you may wish to display a selected screen area in the magnifying window (dropdown mode) or the surroundings of the mouse-pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse-cursor to be displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse cursor setting. please note, that & Kmag; currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard kde; / Qt; -mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse-cursor in the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifying window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you are in addition the & Shift, press down or use the & MMB; you can move the drop-down window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), turn the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts / stops the updating of the display. stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the Update Rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the upgrade rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection box will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short commands to store files, open a new window, print, reload (with the button document again load in & konqueror;), Enlarge and smaller & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag is also known as & kmagnifier; it is a screen magnifier. you can magnify an area of the screen so as if you use a magnifier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click when the mouse cursor stays in the same place for a while. it is intended to help people who suffer from the petitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which each mouse click causes pain. moreover, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. this requires a little practice however.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by the mere moving of the mouse. do you suffer from pain related to the use of your computer, you should consult a doctor if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aid tools: the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click once you stop the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent shift is activated, & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button emulating. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the intelligent shift requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This residence time must be rolled after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click performs.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Positioning is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; wait for the release of the mouse button before releasing the mouse button again when no moving is done in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This feature activates a slow moving to the right and back followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but it can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">When the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the response time. go to the Sound & Multimedia, select sound system and select the tab General. there is a slider sound buffer, which you set to a lower value to shorten response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started with each start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other Windows environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the user button, the settings are reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, you should leave the intelligent shift off first. if you get used to the automatic click, you can later accept the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; to reduce sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of where a mouse click has no effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that do not represent a link does not result in unwanted reactions. you can therefore park the mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to take the mouse ball out. as this happens, mouse is different from mouse to mouse, but it should be clear quickly if you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and the dirt can easily be scratched with a flat blade or a fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent shift in this case, it means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you are using & kmousetool; using a different window manager and moving a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you run a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try and kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor where you want to have it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to have a keyboard input. thus, an accidental move can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around toolbars and menus and titles of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't make it possible to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart sliding is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to mark text, copy and paste it into the clipboard, or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse while pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart shift when you just start using it. instead, select text instead: execute a mouse-click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while moving the mouse-cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this means that every time, when & kmousetool, the mouse button presses a sound like a mouseclick. so you know exactly when the move time starts with intelligent shift. later, you can use the intelligent shift also without the audible mouse click. but this requires some exercise.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window must be installed. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button once the mouse cursor is short. this program was developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to the stupefaction.</seg>

<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced features of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">Text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech dispenser program. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace wrong spoken words or abbreviations, to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand the functioning of filters, it is important to know how the speech-discourse program works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes four types of text.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read-out, the requested orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after the output of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">A message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; have a long text read on a website, you can with & kmouth; notifications are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you send orders from the card card is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for issuing longer texts that do not possess any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, except for the output of Screen Readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one of them reads, this output is stopped and finished.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters will never be applied to the output of Screen Readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters work the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Character chain replacement parts replace parts of a text with other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; is supplied with predefined character chain replacement filters, which allow the creation of chat-emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or by e-mail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use an XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format. in delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML, contained in SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speech selection filters, you can send orders on a speaker depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card-card speaker, you can read the text of KDE news about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues to pass the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts, is sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the established normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from the top down to the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter, and the further below setup dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">To set up character set filters, you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparison samples. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list.</seg>

<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application id running programs get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers you must omit. if for example, & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The Label Wizard will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen Apply filter if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the character-setting filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\ s. so, the words must be limited on both sides by delimiters (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. but if you have installed the & kde; Editor and # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can see it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions.</seg>

<seg id="2651">The Speaker Selection Filter allows you to send text to a specific speaker set up on the Cartridge Spokesperson, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; a text to the filter passes, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected on the basis of the speaker features which the program provides, which sends the text to & ktts; sends, and the characteristics of the speaker set up on the card card spokesman.</seg>

<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks seem to cause errors in the synthesizer, so that whole sets are skipped or only chewing welf. what can I do against it?</seg>
<seg id="2669">First of all, make sure the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language. if there are problems with certain characters or words, this may be remedied by a character set-up filter.</seg>

<seg id="2671">The speech synthesizers used by & ktts have their own license which you will find in the related documentation or on the respective websites. there are also voices that have their own license.</seg>
<seg id="2672">If you have access to the KDE code archive, you can access the kdecompression package with & ktts. you can also download the source code from kdecompression under ftp: / / ftp.kde.org / pub / kde /.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Contains many languages, a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page http: / / espeak.sourceforge.net / languages.html.</seg>
<seg id="2674">American English, British, Spanish, German, Finnish, Czech, Polish, Russian, Italian, French, Canadian French, Kiswahili, Zulu and Ibibio.</seg>
<seg id="2675">KTTS works with any language synthesizer which can be started on the command line in a & console.</seg>
<seg id="2676">The list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizers to the supported languages. check also on the ktts website, for information that is not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The 'speech-Dispatcher' program uses an adaptable modul-architecture for speech synthesizers. if you would like to extend it, please contact the development team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used to support SSml and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later), including packages of kdelibs and development files for the 'speech-Dispatcher' program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you purchase the source code from & ktts from the source code archive for kdecompression or have downloaded the tarball you created every night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using the speech synthesizer, you must first check if speech-disputcher works correctly with your speech synthesizer. to do this, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of speech-disparcher. the ttmsgr utility is to be developed in such a way that the setting of speech-discpatcher is possible directly and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is broken down into individual sentences. the user can return, repeat, pause, or cancel sentences or paragraph styles.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best fitting speaker is chosen. if you want to learn more about how & tts, choose a speaker, look up.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click Add Add actors on the tab card, and thus add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the tab card speaker setup will be displayed. for example, the module will be shown below for the module for Festival Interactive. for details on the modules, see.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the detailed festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text passed to festival. for voices that are & ktats, this setting is done automatically. generally, Western languages use ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these slide controls you adjust volume, speaking speed, and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select a few controls and display this gray, the chosen voice does not allow these settings to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multisyn voices need several seconds to be charged for several seconds due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so (with larger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you haven't set up a speaker yet (or forget to click on user).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window kttsmgr will be shown at the start of kttsmgr. otherwise, after the start, only the symbol ktmgr in the system section is visible, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and ktmgr still does not run, it appears in the system area as soon as KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control it.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all the queues listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the job, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the currently edited proposition.</seg>
<seg id="2694">With the buttons in this row, you can move forward or backward in the order selected in the list below. (but not every order consists of several sets).</seg>
<seg id="2695">By clicking OK, all changes in the settings (also on the other cards) and ktmgr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section. then click on this icon to display the program window again.</seg>
<seg id="2696">If the sound system & arts is not installed, instead it is ALSA, GStreamer or aKode, click the Audio tab. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Here, only text orders are listed and administered. outputs of Screen Readers, Warnings and messages are not displayed. for more information on the message types from & ktts, please refer to.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Select the type of audio output here. if a component cannot be selected, & ktts; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or & ktts; can not load the necessary libraries.</seg>
<seg id="2699">If you want GStreamer or aKode to be used for audio output, select the audio output. if no output modules are displayed in the list, you must install at least one module. if you have selected ALSA, select the PCM device here.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Adjust the speaking speed here. 50nbsp;% is approximately half and 200 free;% about twice normal speaking speed. so that these settings can be implemented, the program must be sox installed.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Click on Apply to take over the new settings for the current & ktn; system.</seg>
<seg id="2702">The list of ALSA devices includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system. most of them will not work. you will need to find out which device works with you. in doubt, choose Standard.</seg>
<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are executed whenever the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four kinds of language records:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of Screen Readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and records these orders. once the output of the screen reader has been read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news like & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News is the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks messages. if you want to read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; still welcome someone who enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">When a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, it adds & ktts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file is always played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the output of Screen Readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To read with & ktts; read KNotify messages, start ktmgr and click Alerts. the card notification message appears.</seg>
<seg id="2711">Check this check box to enable the preview of & kde; notifications. if this setting is not checked, the remaining settings are deactivated and & ktats; do not read alerts.</seg>
<seg id="2712">When this setting is selected, notifications in which a sound is played are from & ktts; not read.</seg>
<seg id="2713">Use these buttons to add or delete events from the list. if you click the Add button, a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list.</seg>
<seg id="2714">This event reads the message, the & conversation; sent whenever someone mentions your nickname in an IRC report.</seg>
<seg id="2715">All events, for which nothing else is specified in the list, are ignored by & ktts; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2716">Use this drop-down selector to specify what & tts; do when an event occurs. you have the following choices:</seg>
<seg id="2717">If you have selected a user-defined text, enter the text you want. you can use the following wildcards:</seg>
<seg id="2718">You can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want here. default selects the speaker, which appears in the list on the Cartridge Spokesperson as the top entry. see also.</seg>
<seg id="2719">Note that there are three levels for events. if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application, the action will be executed. otherwise, the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application.</seg>
<seg id="2720">The event notifications for the application default (all other events cannot be deleted from the list. for this purpose, you can specify the notifications to be read as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2721">Use the Save button to store the settings for the notification in a file. use the Save button to load saved settings from a file. the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list. if you want to start with an empty list, click Delete. all items except All notifications are deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. SSml is a part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently, & ktts; SSml only partially and only in the basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the standard voice, the festival is used in the edition of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonous.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / www.w3.org / TR / speech-synthesis / speech-synthesis / speech synthesis synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / www.w3.org / TR / speech-synthesis / speech-synthesis" &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set-level detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into individual sets. this allows & ktats; faster with pre-reading, since only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set limit recognition filter. at the first start of & ktts, a set limit recognition filter is set up automatically as default. you can change its settings or add more set recognition filters, but beginners will get discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to select the speaker is to select the speaker selection. on the tab card, select which speaker you choose. switch on the speaker selection, change some features and check how the speaker's selection changed. of course, you need more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster with pre-reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel assignments on the card card even if the speech synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only be removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limit recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for set ends and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) at the set limits (tabulator characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the standard set recognition filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never used on & kde; messages (deception), warnings, messages, or the output of Screen Readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal statute recognition filter from view, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc file contained in & tts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">You can override the subscriber settings for the application on the card selection menu. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the uppermost on the card-card speaker). in other words: no speaker features are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most appropriate speaker with all the features of an established speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, choose & ktn; this speaker. otherwise choose & ktts; the speaker, which is most likely to match the original features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter desired subscriber properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the features of the speaker you want. if this feature doesn't matter, don't enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property is to have priority over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application will send text in another language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the area spokesman, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speaker button and then use the speaker closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (no order number is required to enter 0).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ktmgr collapse immediately when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and fracts; it was finished. probably you need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, it is possible to install a non compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or deinstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA doesn't work if I play music at the same time with another application. if I stop a text order, freezes & ktts; ein. on the & console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. information on possible solutions can be found on the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I uploaded an extra voice for festival from the internet. I installed it and can use it in festivals, but ktmgr shows this voice not.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / kttsd / festivalint / vocals add the new voice. as a guide you can use the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch with the & URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and be discoverable via the PATH environment variable. some Synthesizermoduls such as Festival Interactive offer a setting for speed even on the card for speakers. depending on the chosen voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speaking speed are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSml. SSml has own tags, with which the speed is controlled.) Deactivate either the filter for converting HTML, to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite bold, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSml reformerfilter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't make it possible for websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival presenter, but & ktats; reads the websites with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At festival 1.95 beta, the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that the festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file will reject the GENDER tags for converting SSml to Saber. the same also applies to VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate drawing filter and now I can go back or forth in & ktts; no more set-wise or backward. on the tab order orders is displayed, the order consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question marks, exclamation marks, comma and semicolon) may not be filtered. instead, use a filter for syntax detection instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">ALSA (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). ALSA is available on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in the version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules are registered for GStreamer, by using GStreamer in & ktts. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users are experiencing conflicts in connection with ALSA's audio output. if your system counts, you can't play music at the same time and read a text. & ktts; also freeze, if you stop a text order and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode still does not support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set is pre-read.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for general setting of the speaking speed but is otherwise not necessarily necessary. Debian users can install sox with the command apt-get install sox. the program is included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows managing the network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting the kcontrolcenter; Internet & network Network Setting in the & KMenu.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to enable & knetworkconf; the device even shows and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed to install Linux; installed and configured. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files, corresponding to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the option Network Setting in the & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when starting the module network settings, this will attempt to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds to the distribution and the Releasestand. by selecting the setting not-again, the definition can be made permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode. previously, all options are displayed gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you will be required to enter the System Administration mode at the right lower end of the module.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The whole functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Rider Network Interface Unit:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... to set up in the Dialogue Device.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with more options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">By selecting Automatically, the TCP / IP settings are fetched from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information at each system start, therefore no further setting is required.</seg>
<seg id="2812">With the option Manual without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration can be made. in the IP address field the desired TCP / IP address must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface while booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the instrument list.</seg>

<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the machine requests http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will trigger this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator allows you to easily manage this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be sorted by selecting one entry and / or downgrading in the list with buttons Hinds or Herunder in priority.</seg>

<seg id="2833">The installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the precompiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a & konsole; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface can be used, such as kpackage or the installation tool of its distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; in addition, the development packages are required with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only by experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & compile. the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic network technology, in the second section all of & knetworkconf; changes in configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This area cannot replace advanced knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently running with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to go through in the near future, so this description is currently focused on IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface. in foreign networks, on & eg; work place, the network administrator is the contact point to use a valid IP address or if available, DHCP may be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up a small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, the access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are participants in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own machine).</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">This section contains the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf, and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective unpacking.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be bound by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& Tdat; get the band back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. do not know & kdat; the advance credits on the tape do not, you will be asked if the band should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the pre-tensioner, searches for the right index on your disk. if this cannot be found, you will be asked if the belt index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything has gone smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed through the entry of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejecting the tape, first the integration needs to be solved. there are three methods to achieve this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be ejected without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band of & kdat - can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use it to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting with & kdat;. requires your tape drive to format a tape before using. floppy tape drives usually require a formatting of the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, the tape continues with the formatting of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and ready for use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you initiate the backup procedure, you must select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder is backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select in the Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog box opens for backup. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you confirm the settings, the dialog will appear. the dialog will show the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in any of the archives and select the menu item Test....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkered process has been started, the dialog box settings dialog appears. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the verification settings, the dialog appears to be checked. this dialog shows the progress of the exam process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initialize the restore, the files that should be restored must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in any of the archives that are associated with the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick. only the files and / or subfolders that have been selected will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Restore menu....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has started, the dialog for recovery appears. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the recovery settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog will show the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recreate the band indexfile using the tape content. this process erases all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index in two ways from the band:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current work folder in which the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all files listed under backup files, only those files located on the same file system are backed up, as the folder. folders that lie on other filesystems can be entered separately in backup files. each entry is viewed from tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before using tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up via the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is integrated, the command is loaded to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; suspend the ejection at the tape drive. possibly this setting doesn't work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, when resolving the integration of & kdat; automatically discard the tape. do not use this option with floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you need to & kdat; in either case, share the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only cover one memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the band has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the band has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $HOME / .kdat file.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are tar archives created directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The program is designed for inexperienced users who don't know where to get information about your system, or where the system is storing the various protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlogs; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Furthermore, & ksystemlogs; experienced users provide quick access, for example, to information about problems occurring on their server. & ksystem log; therefore, try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes among other things:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for Syslog server format and Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlogs provides functions with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open. will not show you this, and it opens instead of its a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not with system administrator privileges.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion, or after entered strings. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically so that only the log lines will be displayed. in the default setting, the drop-down menu will only be displayed when the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and then enter the name of a process in the filterbar, so show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. protocol lines of Level Errors are displayed with a more noticeable color as minutes lines of the level indication. the colored display of protocol lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you just want to view a specific process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column process. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filtering strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the main window context menu to view all new protocol lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlogs; allows you to display multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlogs; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. dort you will find more recent information about the sources of reference & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystem log; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository: ksystem log; in & kde; -Archives</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and named in the following) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly becomes the standard for the control of the program start-up of the system in the Linux world. it is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about this myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might attempt to switch a machine to System V Init without installing a new installation and reformat. Linux; kernel first looks at / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to start when you start the system or switch to a different running level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">You can also run rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run the serial port in / etc / rc.d.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runtime is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably notice that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change that, you can edit / etc / inittab from hand and change the 3. be very careful if you have messed up the inittab.</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the directory init.d.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written so that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument on stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have & eg; a server running level that lets you run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. furthermore, I could also have a user running level, which & eg; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult, because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between running levels or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. in doing so, the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new area. to just copy them to a new Runtime, you must explicitly select copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the Sortiernummers of the surrounding entries before you can again try to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the trash. be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, runlevel 1 start, running level 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous ones.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another Runtime, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runtime with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sort number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the danger of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, it will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard running levels. and now the machine is constantly starting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default Runtime to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under Runtime X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies configuration for the proprietary set-up programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution: please check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just exit without message if their configuration files are not present or misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of & Linux; -Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the Runtime to be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. this program allows you to manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After making changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two card cards, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space constraints (quota) for users, a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The Card Password Manager appears, if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if for at least one integrated filesystem space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable by the file quota.user / quota.group on the file system). here, parameters can be changed for each user, with the space restrictions mentioned in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The card card groups inform about the group affiliation of the selected user. the default group to which the user belongs will be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add to the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user and / or the selected group works analogously.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
