although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run their sport .
in fact , this country had such a deep impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington how he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magnet , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free from Method You , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona alone increased my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very sch@@ wär@@ mer love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me , how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stops in his opinion behind the mountain as he says so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people have responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever achieved by the party nomin@@ ee .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
also , Tr@@ ump@@ et Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
tr@@ umps In@@ tolerance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced with Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who handled me like her son .
she still fits the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ co , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump went on his way to the nominated Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America .
however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 , more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contemp@@ t for non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people have voted for tr@@ ump because they either shared racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the junk voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters who are most white have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , maybe they wanted to say that they are still important in that country ?
perhaps .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks contemp@@ tu@@ ously on those who look differently from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( An@@ W . Ü ) : white and whi@@ pl@@ ash based on white and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big van Jones described , has killed exactly what America has made so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America is welcome to everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a vast majority of the white America gives up this promise and says : to hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say .
with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , could my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr. Khan asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and her voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone not be like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and vocal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the land for which his son fell , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find any place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t let their love for music spoil by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca province with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an town of C@@ ate@@ ura in common ?
the fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , just 16 miles south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town , which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence .
but this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hop@@ el@@ essness .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle and bustle you learn day by day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ manufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of Fa@@ vio Cha@@ vez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had seen something that he had never seen before : a violin produced by waste .
today there is a whole orchestra consisting of instruments made of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic tr@@ ash @-@ pon@@ y ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance from tr@@ ash to music all around the world .
the orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork thri@@ ve on illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the shared use of content .
in West Africa , it was known back then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it consul@@ ted the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobil@@ ised against the ship . they refused to bapti@@ ze one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior cler@@ k of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia on the basis of lo@@ oting the fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal fishing ( stop illegal fishing ) .
the members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , who then expelled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to track down . therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate breach of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , IU@@ U fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the slu@@ g stamp , with the information between individual countries , the actions now happen in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ tively follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , using satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing license , where they were on the road and possibly , if they have a pen@@ al code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships at their ports based on this information , meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , managing director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the so @-@ called platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues , which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen falling into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world .
their practices include sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , imag@@ inary names , fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and exploit the weaknesses of an un@@ brid@@ led control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is now trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to now , the closed front works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels .
it discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eing ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the International Authority in Co@@ unter@@ ing Crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to track down illegal vessels that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we are trying to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is designed to help identify criminals with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can actually influence this un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened up the Global Fishing Watch platform , together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana , a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed by the position of every single track@@ able ship in the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows the tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only det@@ ecting criminals but also deter@@ ring them .
ships that used to f@@ use without license and had little consequence to reck@@ on now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now posted a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats have bought more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets where they were forbidden .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that other countries now copy us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined together , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; With safety , the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state Somalia reported his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used tra@@ w@@ l nets , which are now forbidden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way of working to protect the oceans really works across the oceans .

her articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , The New York Times and The Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ covering the country &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government rejected Venezuela &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into void by gathering in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the return of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country , including in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is worsen@@ ing continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , Con@@ tri@@ but@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises in her latest article the context of government decision in the following way :
within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a gra@@ ding and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum on ten@@ ure for many as the only way to re@@ conquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , the demonstr@@ ators called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The rec@@ ap@@ ture of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Venezu@@ el@@ ans . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter , images that talk about confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and abuse .
particularly large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the prot@@ esters with@@ drew to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government according to its own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round that forms the scale of repression a day :
so the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official opening procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s for this purpose :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado state that 1 % of signatures are counter@@ fei@@ ted .
here is your inaugur@@ ation !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from its point of view , has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to let go of critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported to the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike rather than work or go shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities at La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied in the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba against his father .
the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , investig@@ ates crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years , he kept the family secret .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was okay .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Service Division in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ ñ@@ os &apos;s son , a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and he said before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a path of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everyone named him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP .
don &apos;t worry that they will not take you some@@ day and I will have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary Pe@@ op@@ les Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian revolutionary workers &quot; party .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers belonging to the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over there the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large cl@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were put off and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wed in and saw a couch tor@@ tured upon men .
she looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that they were fixing this to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
they rarely attached a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw it with water and drove him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there inside was app@@ alling ... like a dirty bottle .
years later when my father was put under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
immediately I recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible for one person to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face down - they were all tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance people looked sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I was seeing the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero ham@@ mer@@ ed and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was sentenced to death by the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the Memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way to which the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look on the map , you will see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
if they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order came from above that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was at the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that one has fought against an enemy .

but when you enter a house and steal the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , painting , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who drive cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we do not need anyone else to do this !
so my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ collar pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ jur@@ er in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can give me a burden on what they wanted .
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the van@@ ishing of the body is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you executed people during the dictatorship . but why let the bodies disappear ?
why to kid@@ nap children ?
one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I asked myself again and again : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
you could have put them in jail .
I guess it was just decided to kill these people , but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people not have families that could be handed over to their mortal remains ?
the van@@ ishing of the body is the last abom@@ inable thing you can do to a person .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machinery to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course there is always something left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie myself .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the idea of showing my father was made during a conversation when he was put under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to witness on his behalf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly disgu@@ sted and asked myself what all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian sentim@@ ents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they allegedly defended were good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally expressed myself against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes : including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 lower oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases pen@@ alties ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 accused died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ say State terrorism
all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped along with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent room :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ humane people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations that have worked for years on justice for victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship :
the process lasted more than three years , but research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government transferred the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there was a memorial to be erected there , which is now run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto , where you can pro@@ long your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
adaptation of original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , witnessed a very un@@ successful translation last month .
the Japanese word was presented in a shield like the &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously - possibly also with malicious mind thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in social media .
the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a Ky@@ ot@@ os citizen . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which was released in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city such as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture continued to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text she received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the insufficient correction ( translation ) from our side , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News dealt with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents all over the country is a reason for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 sen@@ iors in 2005 , representing a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors grew in the same period .
the re@@ porter , named in particular , brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So fla@@ wed is the translation not at all , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common across Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive knowledge of the language in order to understand the source text and active language skills in order to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators are in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language that could translate translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , fa@@ th@@ oming costs or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees let the translations be made in @-@ house . then the Japanese associate , whose knowledge of English is considered to be the best , is a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
the sentences and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the pu@@ zzling prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood at all .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by big companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source of its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; portal ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later on , other users wrote that the internet appearances of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also took footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups opposing the Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros government .
the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , a journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was m@@ apped and recommended to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to gain access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ awi : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an Provi@@ ders are once again blocked .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net site .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially during periods of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ in@@ fil@@ e.com later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online broad@@ cast@@ ers . this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly will transfer its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS .
if a site is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies mis@@ er@@ ably or refuses to request a request from such a website .
we confirm a DNS barrier : @ el@@ bon@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ v@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third closed channel , was dis@@ continued on Thursday , 6th April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV c@@ amer@@ aman El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was imprisoned .
Fl@@ ores was beaten as he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates internet connections , making the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimony from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report by the jury , which is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , deca@@ ying schools &quot; ) edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation from university , she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one who has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began working as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay there are more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
but what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be charged - and all that is within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected witness testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ bs is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double illusion , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , the family who decides to take out their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make something out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the family that embra@@ ces the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education and might even be star@@ ved .
victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in seclu@@ sion in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ ac@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent be@@ atings .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military member Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 Fer@@ rei@@ ra started with a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go &apos;s practice pro@@ found@@ ly responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they designated the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay as children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
without papers it is much easier to off@@ end un@@ punished the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ te .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be landmark - if for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register for bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all the time and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time so that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employers .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the sooner she finished with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to go hungry but didn &apos;t get any in@@ definite food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the owner &apos;s library as food out of the fridge &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she recalls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the library was well @-@ equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ izer of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings the owner of the house , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to not believe the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; again . &quot; that means that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would return home to Guar@@ ani &apos;s native language at home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them .
she was , however , fully aware that she paid for everything she got from them with their hard work .
even at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ minated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never talked about is har@@ ass@@ ment and har@@ ass@@ ment to which Cri@@ adi@@ tas are exposed when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home . I had no circle of friends in the school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group to share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atric girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the advertisement received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the town Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman who also came from Ñ@@ u@@ by offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author switched on again :
dear friends , I have found one . I look to see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ adi@@ tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ adi@@ tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ adi@@ tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history , we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í were ens@@ la@@ ved and subjected to Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were paid tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were paid tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination ) and the system of the Mens@@ encounter , where they become light sacrifices for abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to show power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government authority to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up to give citizens a permission to grant social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users have to register their real names and identity card numbers on the website to be able to use social networks .
if this fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &apos; imprisonment or a fine of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs and uses over the Internet to communicate with others by voice , video , and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted , since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine &quot; Al @-@ Monitor &quot; that registered users received a username and password from the Ministry of T@@ elecommunic@@ ation &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to construct a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on the ground are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Techni@@ cian &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no doubt about the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that as much as they control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who apply for permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court case .
technically , this is by no means realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; stands in accordance with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose minds the control is maxim@@ ized and that no devi@@ ant nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those who are found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot;

this article by To@@ dd Respon@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article is published as part of a content sharing agreement .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights campaig@@ ner H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working on protecting the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which strikes through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish eco @-@ system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a great predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and advoc@@ ates that protection zones for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region are set up .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , has been docum@@ enting the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; Three Times Cat@@ astrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ensu@@ ing ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring coun@@ t@@ ess Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture also experienced a nuclear accident , alone that &apos;s why 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows , from the local point of view , what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents .
the full report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of the suffer@@ ers themselves .
the housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of planned replacement H@@ ouses were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed here .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with 70 percent is the final light .
nevertheless , six years after the catastrophe , even six years after the catastrophe , Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el Meetings ( or , Kaz@@ et@@ su pr@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) res@@ ett@@ led into final replacement houses .
after the three @-@ cavity disaster , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of those ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful on this occasion . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ ac@@ uation , which after the disaster struck in house shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools who were affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ land from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma stays far off .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal residents find it harder to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ ac@@ uation participants . it questioned them about the state of reconstruction and how their emp@@ athy has changed vis @-@ à @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami @-@ risk .
in her introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of those surv@@ eyed believe that not enough has been done in regard to disaster prevention .
as it is about those ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her edition of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ated people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the devastating earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma &apos;s pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
out of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent substitute houses .
as of 2017 , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation centers , which are still in Beh@@ el hausen , older than 50 years old , are known to fail because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people from other countries meet people who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities first .
after a while , however , one often sees that more connected than it appears at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , bro@@ aden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with topics that get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members remember@@ ing a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has strengthened the lack of shared language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

right : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was handed over to the intensive care unit last Friday . last Friday , a police officer had struck him with a strike against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him on Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás have known that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive ward , his face would be visible for six months on TV and the entire repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz Lu@@ z on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly after him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10.000 bracel@@ ets ( about 2,@@ 700 Euros ) to cover part of the costs for medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado is calling for further acts of violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ er@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ app group joined the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who struck him with a strike .
police sur@@ geri@@ es
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only State in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers were at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP , Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to refrain from violence against prot@@ esters via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has sli@@ pped street protests by directing the focus to another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ screen .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported on a broken glass window in order to illustrate with a photo their title pages illustr@@ atively .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken wind@@ screen than the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special thing .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of material damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
villages forgotten by the H@@ indu@@ str@@ alization in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso close to hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba concluded the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site .
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others are res@@ ig@@ ning and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that are still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier @-@ veter@@ an , who runs every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period of time are in operation again because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry with@@ stood the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the community saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane plants were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive were they un@@ sustainable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural Issu@@ es &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; that was the first words by Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o .
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane plants , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane mill Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he says most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es have the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
it was a matter of officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in use , &quot; he affir@@ ms .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped build .
with every part he removed he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
Cuba &apos;s most developed industrial area and the most important counter@@ tops have been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president in the eyes of the persons present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding since 2004 .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ assemble them , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ted the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other businesses as well .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they have become spar@@ es .
without future prospects , many young people left the region at once .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production does not even serve for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant continue to be impressive .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
nin@@ ety @-@ nine crops bring the old soldier a retirement of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that he told him .
they have tor@@ tured him for ten years .

first Nations young people use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture

teenagers of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do it using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the teacher David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e @-@ communities in North Que@@ bec and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop proposes that young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main performers .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ zum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
most cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages although the young people do not always speak the languages of the First Nations in native language .
in the following hymn , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation have recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from Nor@@ th@@ stars Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe , who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an the stan@@ za is available in Um@@ schrift , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel as if nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and proceed with our youth as well
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the commentary section , the reader and advocate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( for , etc . ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , what is exactly on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to@@ u ( &quot; plastic models of dishes &quot; ) of any dish served in this restaurant .
customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are many small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend transforms them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
near Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes coated cell phone tapes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in dietary supplements is becoming increasingly more time @-@ consuming .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we have found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part of the exhibition at Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple which holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or laughing gas is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing gas ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic meals can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and w@@ rist@@ bands made of dried salmon .
other bizarre plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # . , .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , then this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi neighborhood , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry , for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ to@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing persons and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the mour@@ ners or the communities that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico created the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; with the Drug Tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were caught up in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire congregations have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear life changed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly those stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who scans secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on only one single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked ourselves to go and to search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprenticeship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment she has no income .
you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but they are not paid out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known disease and sensation @-@ journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with images , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files by specialists .
it brings me out of the lamp@@ stand .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or look at this as normal .
she continues writing :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fu@@ tility of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town can be justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wet &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not moving and still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; it describes how armed criminals were forced to make money from their business every month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain will never pass away , the trauma remains , fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ nap or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether tears would dis@@ integrate my deep @-@ rooted emotions , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to cry . I must learn to live with the pain .
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , warm tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier when he was only a couple of blocks away from his home , saw the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , which had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looks like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , as a result of organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of mur@@ ders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; the 2015 animal Pol@@ í@@ tico established the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , which aims to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this post and the pages to which he is linked involve images where violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared the first time ? content in social media , whether true or false , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial release , it has been mis@@ leading to identify trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between picture and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 a tank car crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died .
after the civil war Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es , which were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank car fell victim to the victim .
local authorities described a fire@@ ball , which covered dozens of houses , including a movie near which was full of people who watched the World Cup .
houses burned and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ability .
a picture entitled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident will depic@@ t the dre@@ ad@@ ful scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been ti@@ pped several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody was left to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been cut in pieces , shot or burned .
the following time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from DR Congo emerged again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ sely relate the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to supply arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a Blitz@@ krieg , published by the United Nations , those who could escape were beaten , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts resem@@ bled the following , which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page fal@@ sely claiming that Myanmar &apos;s president has said that monks and politicians were involved in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , they had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be viewed here .
other news agencies referred to AF@@ P as their source have also wrong@@ ly attributed Th@@ an to this statement , but had not brought the picture from DR Congo in connection with it .
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
using an inver@@ ted image search , you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries .
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages , including English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed false reports , occasionally others have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of the ab@@ u@@ sive usage and associated them with the respective countries based on what side they had been published . thus , we want to present the range more clearly than by the language alone .
from the below listed countries ( which are also linked to one another in some cases ) , several examples may be used for abuse .
here are some cases which can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
card : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of incorrect post@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false reports .
the Coun@@ tries in Grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are likely to show fal@@ si@@ fication examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only uses the wrong message , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although it is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
France , 2015 .
T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , like this one , who used the image from DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no pages such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster to refu@@ te this .

Hong Kong , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme example of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand , the attempt of a blo@@ gger to del@@ egi@@ timi@@ ze the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being used , as the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government posted a right to judge what it meant as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intentionally resour@@ ceful news and photos , international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this rec@@ tification , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors used by H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims are killing Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often propag@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inf@@ ancy angi@@ ography &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill the Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page wrong@@ ly claimed that the president of Myanmar managed his 2012 , that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed by B@@ oko Har@@ am released from the news page An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital published now , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were links to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burns , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo sub@@ merged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ et@@ ted ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message pur@@ ported to circul@@ ate by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , discussion forums such as this were in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false .
the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated from the message in which the image from the DR Congo was included .
there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
unlike other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , Tin@@ Eye also points , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that perme@@ ate these posts , the first frame focused on religion .
the photograph was used for greater discussion about the silence related to the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of thousands of people who inad@@ vert@@ ently take part in drinking water around a tragedy .
suggest this mood of mis@@ information and mis@@ information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and de@@ mis@@ es the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , the concern is that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing readers and viewers and depri@@ ving them of the ability to emp@@ ath@@ ize emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent depic@@ tions in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used away from context or entirely ab@@ u@@ sive way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
Andy Sim@@ mons photo is licensed under CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online @-@ list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - R@@ oo@@ king your parents in recognition of how they have tried to care for you in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and words in the H@@ uns@@ etry language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the ease or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site want to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite wine .

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floods and land@@ slides in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which is normally used at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ es@@ hah and At@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have res@@ igned in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
following a response from the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people have been killed and almost a hundred people are missing because of floods and slu@@ dge charges .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe places of stay .
the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ w@@ ama Town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood water .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods devast@@ ate the food crisis , Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are made ready for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organisations and startups have also volunte@@ ered to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka ren@@ ders important information on flood and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams are using dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call at 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) taxi call asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the disaster centre is informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u Trop@@ ical storm , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood relief &quot; button allowing users to pick up a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then distributed free of charge to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they also launched a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button that resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flood and land@@ slide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unified efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security to residents in need and provide aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long road to the restoration of norm@@ ality .
the Muslims that cannot be seen
the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
when in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and a loving friend .
I confi@@ de in her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the burning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we are still calling slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we &apos;ll see rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some holding the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf , bound from an American flag , others are sc@@ aping slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that have built up in their imagination .
they have ab@@ used me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice different religions .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , to different kinds . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like I do not fit in there , are un@@ consci@@ onable .
ab@@ domin@@ als are being m@@ ashed
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;an and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the Western notion the religion of Rum@@ is was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting constitutes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have colon@@ ized Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images .
but these pictures stand out even today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to understand them .
I &apos;ve been working in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I &apos;ve seen these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ rations continue to dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shad@@ owed the reality that in the last three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this nar@@ ration fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their veil in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mighty group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who engage movements for change .
it also shows that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been ho@@ ist@@ ed here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and fla@@ wed that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because of these stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry , we are doing more than telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is African @-@ Muslim Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother put her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan was re @-@ thinking the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ wit@@ ted Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a must @-@ have Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief that all Muslims wear - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
we must also not be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists seeking to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which has manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who tears the veil over a woman .
or as the terri@@ fying card of attacks on mos@@ ques across the United States , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms reaches our affili@@ ation .
it attacks our identity , which is so broad , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
maybe my friend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the everyday ritual with my daughter when I kept her silent in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to protect the Koran and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that they be protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , poses with her sisters sometime in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grandmother on my mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; how they win a contest of art of floral arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades ago .
it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete pictures painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
being Muslim is how she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ ght , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - was colon@@ ised by an empire , which established a company called Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather wept .
in the meantime , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept over his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , who ruled India in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at play risk .
to be Muslim means to know that over the last two centuries , Europeans have colon@@ ized all up to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ em@@ ian sub@@ tan of the British Empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

to belong to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent except Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the rub@@ ble of war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy visits the USA and the suspect bears a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim ban@@ ker .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties , with multiple lines , but failing to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion presents more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registr@@ ations that began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it is in the immigration official who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that sh@@ uts its borders to people from the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ List &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we lead and the bombs which we reject on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ appropriate image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to disclose the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have decades back to recognise the roots of our fears , and the faulty and dangerous visual expressions that we get into our message editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ As@@ h Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; S@@ apphire &apos;s Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to attract more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are located .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who exist in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given it ; now they dominate big areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was so old as it now is my daughter , but who have made me an un@@ bound Muslim today .
things that I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb trail in my speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that may spark memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitute our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place as part of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not concepts that we usually throw in our schools around us , or which we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk in 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are fought and how people were given to the public presentation of the &quot; other , &quot; four decades ago , even scientist of Stan@@ ford was .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; other &quot; ; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake feeds , while he already en@@ capsul@@ ates countries and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to get and appreciate the variety of languages of big cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project the following applies :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to it often is connected with understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are used instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to appreciate , to feel , to make . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , historians tell their story initially in their own language and then translate or explain it in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story@@ t@@ eller , their devotion and their interpretation lead to the audience entering into it .
they provoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story @-@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event , John Ny@@ aph@@ iti tells the tale of rab@@ bits and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ aph@@ iti is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they have listened to !
they were alert ...
they were with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers are hoping to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling performances .
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ fixing of public debt from the US
with the aim of a re @-@ audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to $ 72 million , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march started at the pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ des Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
she was called &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen &apos;s front for the re @-@ examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting in Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the re @-@ fixing of debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico are demanding that the politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed remuneration corresponding to our working conditions , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not find themselves with declining pension payments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the United States &quot; sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation focusing on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on the responsibility of the state , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico also requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside will run without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night vi@@ gil for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of book S@@ prints &apos; finished books produced within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom ) .
the book published last year and available here roy@@ alty @-@ free includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real cost to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or residence .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom , and instantly .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have let us begin to think about their own fate , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Military Police P@@ asha on the basis of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strictly secret &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs and conditions remain unknown .
a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project founded by Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
maybe none of them was looking forward to cultural prototypes than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture mixes with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time , Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture that not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet finished this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent all my life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he taught me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ stitute , which she wrote in the years 2012 @-@ 2015 to her husband when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book by Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that every one of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
I forget the cr@@ ush of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and over your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s detention , G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
during the process
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage of the monsters
Bas@@ lan &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared in the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or forci@@ bly displaced by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans died in prison since 2011 according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call for the hope we have to do for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption @-@ convic@@ ted director after release of prison again on previous post
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a case of corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused of ab@@ sc@@ attering 54 million me@@ tics ( around 800@@ ,000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose Council was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released for good lead in 2016 and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not undergo any disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many inhabitants don &apos;t mean the action good .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and under@@ lines the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we notice is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary proceedings against the infrin@@ gement .
however , the company apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal action to apply the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ pul@@ sive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t damage .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
re@@ pul@@ sive !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not have any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and to serve the state , * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead serves himself only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a source of an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so well rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison , not only as a first independent president but also as a sharp , engaging and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he vigor@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious person was capable of all , even the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released .
and today the company , with which he funds funds , res@@ ig@@ ns again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ OM@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ Business@@ Coun@@ cils ( @ az@@ ar _ Ra@@ fik ) 12 May 2017

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or spl@@ itting b@@ lower . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network shared their posts because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still deb@@ ated , it is usually used to refer to people of East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Bur@@ m@@ ese script &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Cal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for its use .
moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamentally different mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spine ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( Kam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the facilit@@ ator A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet considers that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it sol@@ ves all posts that are suspected of spreading racism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to fac@@ tor@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting b@@ sen ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who dissemin@@ ate hate speech , have received quite a good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise your nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who hate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply going to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from browsing , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author shared his views on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition it seems as if they started it without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely solved posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them great sales , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship provided much ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately write &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the grid .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech , but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should also stimulate the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where clas@@ hes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for its failure to control the balancing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; it would have looked better , rather in context than concentrating on code , and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law which should forbi@@ d this practice , so that the age of marriage is now at 18 .
prior to this change of the law , some members of Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ sal@@ ami Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contracting partner of the UN Convention on Children Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN statistics for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children already married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws on to@@ dd@@ lers followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this actually un@@ complicated matter , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country has to agree and let the law be announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which once again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the child marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes for it and no one vote against it .
once it was decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of social media users were enthusiastic because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ured the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost worth every price .
while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ o @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day finally arrived :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Her@@ vor@@ ra@@ gging News !
the law has been decided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , who belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , is a civil society who spoke openly about the importance of the adoption of the law :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation for 18 years .
the amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment of the marriage was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 were present at the voting .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were present have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) Eli@@ minate atro@@ city abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who cont@@ ested him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible catch occurs in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed and he seems to rede@@ em his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj was to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Mak@@ rel@@ l suggested :
rather , instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that we invite the state to our bedrooms , &quot; just pur@@ pos@@ efully talk about the state that our daughters guard against it , that they might be ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled males who are opposed to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or continues to be the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can see Wikipedia content again
the Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA , internationally obsc@@ ured .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ ypass tools for blocked web pages ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocks of the Internet have been taking place since 2007 after the Internet law ( no . 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) .
one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is nevertheless call@@ able despite legal ban .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after we have heard the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in mind to put the sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least look at all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the site www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has brought both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Le@@ aks , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when the respective country Wikipedia is banned .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i - Global Vo@@ ices member and staff at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ rah@@ i &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror .
you access a different URL , which is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

and his hom@@ etown right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly I called myself to Navar@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River .
the river dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to sn@@ apping pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en understanding for the fact that wild animals are not as fear@@ some as they look .
and he should know it , for he was already standing face to face with Tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be bo@@ thered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the book was appearing . he sat down immediately , we looked at us and he star@@ es at me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for conservation ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accomod@@ ations .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to speak out their hus@@ bands name for the first time

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally released on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version was re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid speaking with the greatest care , the name of their hus@@ bands , or even of older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure , they should respect the husband , as well as fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice in life .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was expelled from the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a mock tribunal and was inf@@ ring@@ ed by her family and the village community after addressing a married relative with his name .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives apart from their names is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear if at all they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs there in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers community and sets up for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola has been working with her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices such as children &apos;s marriage up to the ban@@ ishing of HIV and AIDS infected and manages these clubs .
it reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and have made them ambass@@ adors of the changes at the same time .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion rounds were women who didn &apos;t name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify .
not to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud is a custom that they have all committed du@@ ti@@ fully and never questioned .
raw ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is regarded as dec@@ eit@@ ful , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this until this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name of her husband , wanted to try out at home how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on with his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , were protected .
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
then she asked all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ola from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking up a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women never allowed to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
a woman was so shy that she ch@@ ained only in front of her during the whole exercise ; another decided to let out the complete fru@@ stration of him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the rush of adren@@ aline about having broken with an ancient tradition , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands in their name .
and they kept their word .
Roh@@ ini received a lot of reports in the coming days .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop telling his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed at her , she was frigh@@ tened and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was based on violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the sc@@ in@@ ox @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I told my husband that I would carry the zin@@ ap@@ ian red point if he did .
he just laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing it .
the other women have not stopped completely , but think they are now in a better position to choose to wear it on some days .
for many women , the Dis@@ cussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip with every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cake for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are tied to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only worn sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a salad @-@ kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes , the morality combined with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple Kur@@ tas ( shirts ) into a discussion round , so that the women could carry them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they &apos;ll manage it .
to the question whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini ass@@ ures that things are moving slowly :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done little steps so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped to say the name of their husband .
some , including myself , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their life - like the hag@@ gling about more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini Ex@@ pla@@ ined :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a day of commem@@ oration
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29 this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be read in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turn@@ around in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who was exclusively inter@@ viewing the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail trade Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! the day today is the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . for more than 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo .
also today songs are sung by the Beat@@ les in Japanese kar@@ a@@ oke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the Beat@@ les kit@@ sch survived all this .
today is The Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the known places related to the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fiel@@ ds ( memorial in New York )
4 ) P@@ enny Lane
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
sometimes the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges cannot be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today is The Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
right today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran over Abbey Road .
the same we did last year .
and of course , some companies also use the fan base for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! , Today is The Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
and what could this be for a day ?
today I will listen to &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya .
so the day will run today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be target of attacks in Mozambique .
photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald persons for organ trading , presumably for dis@@ believers , worried the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ton , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conf@@ essed that the organs of sham@@ ans were used in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can bring gold or wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC explained .
it is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , which is the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
bew@@ are of bald men who travel to Mozambique . bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Muslim police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ton , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ haf@@ i Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police is already pursuing the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the prosecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ t@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably dis@@ believers rituals , has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a faith exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been killed in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha told the chron@@ icle of B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ na@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I MA@@ KE GER@@ MAN ONE Mos@@ ambique , TH@@ AT I am ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation in which people would pursue honest pursu@@ its or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald persons are hun@@ ted for ab@@ u@@ sive purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for imp@@ ec@@ cable humour .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and thrilled Twitter us@@ ern@@ ers , twe@@ et@@ ted that both Chief of the District Mor@@ t@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both are well known :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mos@@ ambi@@ an authorities are very concerned about the mur@@ ders of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot;

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made only recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement by Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o drew attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized because of liver cancer at the terminal stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; sub@@ version &quot; ( state je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing ) after participating in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; internal matter &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
however , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely avoided the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some international reactions .
United Nations - united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Li@@ u a treatment abroad .
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway fell stag@@ gering after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it did not end up with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China , as exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after spreading the news that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top @-@ ranking diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as she announced in an explanation on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to abol@@ ish all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they are meant to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he helps him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the U.S. Embassy sum@@ mon@@ ed a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible comments on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley stated that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of its choice , which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condition@@ ally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to release the Nobel prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can embar@@ k on proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
at the heart of Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hopes that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources in Peking told Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on China to provide Li@@ u with appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression and freedom to exercise these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France in France
on 29 June , France &apos;s Foreign Office urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments that he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome the Li@@ u government in the country , the State Department announced that there was no further information whether France would ultimately receive it .
Taiwan Floor system Taiwan
the Council of Ar@@ land@@ ings in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who advocate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 around Li@@ u and stated that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
the world is Singapore .
licence : CC@@ 0 Dom@@ aine Public
is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
this statement spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of meeting the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turn logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you &apos;re not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons quoted by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of this , it inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently managed by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re comes up again from the author@@ itarian rulers to be the democr@@ ats , leaving the distorted logic as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam in the last week were really non @-@ answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system .
he was able to answer such questions in a rational way with non @-@ responses .
Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear this point in case he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out as to the critics that one should begin to read the entire manuscript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam testim@@ onies , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the inscription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ important even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as the leader of an adol@@ escent generation makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what awaited me - whether I agree or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes that is really associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ covers the vulner@@ abilities of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make good faith a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the cabinet , Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam comments are of grave importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they defend their city not their country ?
who does our Prime Minister pay for bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
, the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade is ten@@ ding to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country in particular &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of defending the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et is to be displayed .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question most posed to me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been living there since 1994 and back in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his convers@@ ational partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook in@@ war@@ dly when they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who does not know himself , there is little that separates us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans bring a Canadian flag easily visible on their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
they all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ...
so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : being ter@@ med &quot; nice &quot; means to be careful - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has his own Canadian counterpart ) .
if Canada was really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
being harmless means being in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not paying attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major property of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to just take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just nice .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ding Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that de@@ codes the jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 , and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who talks about what prec@@ ep@@ ts his girlfriend does . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not explicitly political , the music video also indirectly refers to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 songs .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; Der Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies , in particular as regards the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta .
take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Army an absolute decision making over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change the settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear provisions are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army to monitor online content and prosec@@ ute people accused of being slan@@ dered and prosec@@ uted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thailand puts a strict &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read the majority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lese Maj@@ este &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , there was a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta is still pursuing is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an intern@@ ment repository , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during protests in 2014 .
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East Asia Minor , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern districts of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ n@@ ava are located in the coal reservoir of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asi@@ ans , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people living in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after having barely risen over a decade .
about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district in 1989 .

the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ hr@@ ow@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native old man .
he starts talking and it &apos;s hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens serving all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have left the district in the meantime .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , about fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the ch@@ ry@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas that still house one or two families can be seen on the balconies , where washing is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hands , they retreat immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to let us photograph , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable growing .
it is difficult to get over the laps .
in winter , the district administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ zh@@ ra@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says .
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; shel@@ ters migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border from Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and will be published here with kind permission .
on the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
it is run by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll frame and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Afrika .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez tells the people to get into full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Afrika !
where are you mother Africa ? . &quot;
at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have also been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys drugs that they cannot pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the shots exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ i@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it fits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao is travelling with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull towards north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um Afrika is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells us that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans travel together often together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards in order to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ i@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; m@@ um Afrika is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez says that her guests often send out text messages when they left to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city there is a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after living there for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes to them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next step .
back in Mama Africa &apos;s house everything is full of guests again .
in the ais@@ les , travelers will calm@@ ly consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but it is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ ma , she brow@@ ses in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , as she introduces it to me briefly .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the residents of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on 10 July , mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi obtained a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities wanted to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia ten Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group shortly after they installed the app .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication of the police state that the app would detect and follow the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal religious &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; activities and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; harmful information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can , of course , be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person home network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ ons about digital cens@@ orship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ uses and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; which is based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , displayed photos from a check@@ point where police inspec@@ tors checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected in a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the physical surveillance technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( RU@@ B ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents .
all branches of government , authorities and affiliated organizations , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the order to leave their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole series of other possible off@@ ences , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death , part 1 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything cries after death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ leep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognis@@ able , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that makes honour to their name .
one that has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if the reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even though the earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents have built , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone for stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the chief of the security service put it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all districts were cov@@ eted , only my own .
for the first time it was still , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put any high demands on a city that has been blocked up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down a bit after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke the silence by shou@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; several times from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent picture that filled my expectations .
in such a moment you become aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the slightest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after you &apos;ve scre@@ amed it all the way to the office of the security service out of the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men there ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to speak : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you scre@@ am &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or you are brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his eyes filled with hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you are really gri@@ eving what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , vanity , perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my thing when I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest chat that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal with that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence lies in my nose until today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I ro@@ de through the courtyard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I put all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have assigned me a bigger cell this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must share it with only one other prisoner , and I can put myself immediately without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I went back to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested method of communication : beating with the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first @-@ first &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a prominent middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness there is no apparent apparent field of sight on me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
maybe he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will be interro@@ gated right away .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would leave him free if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to disp@@ el all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head .
from the distance I hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it has to be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries res@@ ound every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of cal@@ am@@ ity until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th of the Koran ) .
&quot; they are here to be interro@@ gated . &quot;
this was the secret of the secret : in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from fre@@ eing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - so they played out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mailing list and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their view of the world .
this is not a house , it is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminal of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a sle@@ ek and sto@@ cky man ; at least he seems to me that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he catches a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I have grown accustomed to not responding .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to punishment , although I did nothing to deserve this penalty .
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er is delighted at your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot keep your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row .
I had lost any sense in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t like it , so he gra@@ bbed the next to an electrically charged bar .
electricity f@@ lowed all my body , enough to supply my entire district .
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted teen@@ ager : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be worried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move away , you &apos;ll be laid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he lo@@ oses to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ stained lips .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as fel@@ u@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ tried opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are relevant not only in his home town of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as a person who is not restricted by borders in his thinking , and according to his own statement , he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special a@@ version to US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe his compassion for those seeking to survive in war zones , to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian fle@@ d@@ acious of the second generation , &quot; he describes himself , even though he was born in Jordan , and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he po@@ urs down Nes@@ café in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with age @-@ old traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a sen@@ sel@@ ess hot jun@@ ta has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the s@@ war@@ ms of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ ron of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the open sky , especially when you look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just as to drink water in the public during Ram@@ adan - in order not to land in prison .
recently the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former press spokes@@ persons of the Islamic coalition , Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b , said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been canc@@ eled because of the sexual orientation of the singer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that question the old approved legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la inv@@ aded the Jord@@ anian people as a &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights , &quot; who still decided to advocate an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simply rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflected a increasingly clear @-@ cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b decreased traditional gender standards by educ@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently worn unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &quot; hon@@ orable mor@@ se &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ our@@ able kill@@ ings reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is still alar@@ ming that Jordan does not have the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a 1954 law crime control law , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; in@@ definitely be held in prison , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from themes that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come out of the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been att@@ un@@ ed to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward S@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , one verse repe@@ ats stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - either faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and les@@ bians &apos; rights and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember later that his comments were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored according to his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but stre@@ amed was only a edited version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly campaigns for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ which , a poet of the eighth century , who still remains in memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ ova , who was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jordan do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the Association of Te@@ ach@@ ers , argu@@ ing that they had critic@@ ised social media comment@@ aries on the problems connected with the corruption deep in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experiencing them &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ ficially created demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until this is done , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and , consequently , resist@@ s resistance .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the festive carri@@ ages , drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the West of Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ e , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seating , so we got a great view .
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( liter@@ al ) .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
however , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ meter @-@ high car was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely were external appearances and body care as important as in this story , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crimin@@ ality and promote a legitimate profession like the hair@@ dresser &apos;s .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ ies and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region is not safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led more and more normal citizens to embar@@ k on the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these lav@@ ish hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which goes to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the Fris@@ eure du Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , which has been held since 2014 .
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks from them , as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against bar@@ ber tools and instead of poor advice to get an education in hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love with the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tea After@@ T@@ wel@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel ou@@ tri@@ ght ?
this is exactly what the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ ic Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation left the head and inspired them to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Car@@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
it was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the point of view of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , who lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried their arms around the clock , now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take these into their ranks and support them in building a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ istian convinced the young Colom@@ bians to join together and help the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that is exactly what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters in order to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter , who will be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
he explained that we write thousands of letters of love to the people whom we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he continued to tell us this year to share his love with people who needed the most urgent need .
thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC soldiers who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters in person .
the F@@ ARC members set themselves up as they had done before in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in @-@ between , &quot; the Political Science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a told later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters lived ) I saw a gu@@ er@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL gr@@ en@@ ade , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am responding to a letter someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never in my life has someone written something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him quite firmly and placed me beside the gar@@ net @-@ laun@@ chers .
perhaps he was also tired of the war , was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
at the beginning students and some of the F@@ ARC leaders came to a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already at war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State affected the whole Colom@@ bian people . now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear those people who had never heard before and had no right to vote and realize that the people I often saw as monsters and hated even people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former warri@@ ors have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would reign after dis@@ ar@@ ming .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to take up arms , raise up and protest for their rights . and that is also completely justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC are now set on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call on all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and make sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .

this is the translation of an article auth@@ ored by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ co and whose first publication was published on the website of OC Media .
homosexu@@ als and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with terr@@ ors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not only come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that address the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ az@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Ch@@ echn@@ ya authorities who took suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she felt she was a woman in reality since her childhood .
when she was grown up she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned about the gender balance of their country wife , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
from fear of her life she finally moved to the USA .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per for a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was just going to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ yan : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I just know it was a young man , not thirty years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the last analysis .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stab@@ s in my right lung .
OC Media : in which cases were you laid down - in which men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and appe@@ aled to the women .
I am very grateful to him for that .
when I read his name for the first time in his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for treating me with respect .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya in order to prove that it was all a lie .
they set absurd demands : some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad news and Photos@@ hop .
I have particle size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has sh@@ amed not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten .
my human rights activ@@ ist friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help , I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought them without registering with me , without identification , without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
in the moment I wanted to call my mother per W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re safe , just because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you are . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , it is a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this pastoral barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera I actually make effort to look at the person she re@@ members from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
for that I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has been in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not lock a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
that is what I mean , they probably invite relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still being held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not so many .
if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to submit themselves to Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should they be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but pur@@ pos@@ efully sub@@ merged in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise itself .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was incar@@ cer@@ ated in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible .
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known all over Gros@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in seri@@ ousness !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer at that time than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually turned us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore blue jeans and short tops .
the Ministry of Defense of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ led me even one hair .
in front of the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rot is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of sick people .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they have never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never defeated .
OC Media : how long did this grace season last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behaviour of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change .
those who had laugh@@ ed before and laugh@@ ed at first looked at you with suspicion .
at that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic constantly worsen@@ ed .
OC Media : what activity do you now pursue ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize tea vessels , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I have not paid a cent for this .
I discovered these people by themselves when I cleared the type of flood .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
nature is so , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you know with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys on them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an have what the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have what ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet here so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mos@@ que and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think of transition to men who love men , and they believe that you change his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all for that - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : usage with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ on on August 27 came into the spotlight the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the Sou@@ thwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability for his family to rise , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything .
he died short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month saw some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families on the basis of the prosecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi settled in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took over power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime is systematically rej@@ ecting the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas to the Persian provinces , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ating the devast@@ ation caused by d@@ rought , and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ i adolescents has now increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the director of Iran for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who were looking for a job had completed primary school , 55 % completed secondary school leaving 45 % university degrees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at eliminating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ or human rights activ@@ ist living in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since officials and institutions do not preference to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ el them to earn their living outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes .
given the circumstances the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to bear , human rights activists are beating the alarm before the situation will explo@@ de .
it remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alist not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all women .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men despite the same education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
I am convinced that I am suffering dou@@ bly and thre@@ ef@@ old among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin color , on black trans@@ gender women , on black trans@@ gender women , on black women in LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used with racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
yet they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about sexu@@ alised violence as an institution@@ alized form of racial violence , which we face black women in a tw@@ o@@ fold manner .
or that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black sphere and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all people of any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I cannot join as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her thinking , which refer to both sex and skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer have to fight for my membership in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ mented and marg@@ inal@@ ised being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that , through cultural appropri@@ ation , absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women appreciate the importance of the overl@@ apping of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to instruc@@ t them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish itself from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name .
I prefer to release myself whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly from femin@@ ism and join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we black women define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and where the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist .
I am recognised as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment in which my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Respon@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non Govern@@ mental Organization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Water@@ ville Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - a subsidiary of Water@@ fund Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one of Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on neglected , little respected sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of collaborative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities to tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their tough@@ er fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women represents &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weeping women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the murder of women in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by the cur@@ ator . the article is part of the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ jer ( # wei@@ r@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman appeared in Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez did not use the A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos; know@@ led@@ geable display .
a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her adver@@ t .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women make an adver@@ t at all , they generally do not receive support from the State .
in many cases , the women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to being victims of violence can report at all to law enforcement agencies .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Stri@@ ps and statistics 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing under Paragu@@ ays &apos;s laws : good base , poor implementation of strokes and statistics
it is difficult to find out how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a socio @-@ scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office found out 9@@ 600 ads on domestic violence , with 70 % of them fighting for violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5,000 advertisement for domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of the advertisements of women came here as well .
in the advertisements , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; on any woman who has been notified in Paraguay for psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two women who do not do this are entitled to any woman who fails to report on physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year .
until August 2016 , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that does nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should repent her forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red mental violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I never thought I would be a victim of mal@@ treatment .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are fool@@ ed by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they liked this so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of ill @-@ treatment had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything began with psychological abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
Victoria &apos;s indications with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal fight between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good but not to be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill introduced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # pr@@ es ) was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ Wen@@ ders ) are part of a Twitter campaign backed by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that Fem@@ ale is to be declared a criminal off@@ ence and to punish har@@ sh@@ er as is the case already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus , the legal text was changed in some points in order to win MPs for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions banned in Paraguay is generally prohibited and pun@@ ishable by up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had intended to impose the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must carry themselves , if they simply want to reimbur@@ se them and receive a secure accommodation to the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
there must be a change of thinking , so that violence is no longer considered to be normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts will complic@@ ate and contribute to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators will be punished .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to reimbur@@ se such a long time until ill @-@ treatment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law were altered , including a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a major set@@ back .

independent media in Oman one year after the ban of a newspaper continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website has been banned because of a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be found on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Auth@@ orities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the Sul@@ tan@@ ate .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he is serving a year @-@ old prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and put on trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after leaving his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , alongside his role as the single sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s regime is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , restrictions and torture of human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline .
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure , and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its inc@@ eption in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , chief editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested , after an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties in the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in an inheritance dispute .

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited to the special department from the ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS captured the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief according to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper in any way , including online , banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the Trial Chamber held the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot;
in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &quot; imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3,000 US dollars each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1,000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a b@@ ail was set in the amount of $ 5000 ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months in prison .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month jail sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he is serving his year @-@ old prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to leave Az@@ am@@ n again , the paper continues to be exposed to attacks by the An@@ de@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and the Minister again postpon@@ ed the decision of the Appe@@ als Court to allow the publication of the newspaper .
the permanent closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press in Oman has recently been viol@@ ated .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the country &apos;s first independent online newspaper to cease its operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Afgh@@ an authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Afgh@@ an authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally released ;
2. to create a safe environment for the paper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . under all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their ri@@ ghtful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory actions , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring states by promoting freedom of expression and freedom as well as the right to assemble , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with its consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , and it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site : firstly , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more grave impact in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment in resear@@ ching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists itself helps build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic had first serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently running a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
GA : what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain the recipient rather than being a creator himself .
the solutions we get are often not good in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GA : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GA : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GA : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GA : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it &apos;s the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has bred Sal@@ ad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own resour@@ c@@ efulness and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
the patents applied not only to individual types , but also for certain characteristics , such as resistance to diseases , special red or green ton@@ gs or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants , such as cereals or cart@@ els . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production .
as a passionate advocate of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but in the meantime he needs longer , since his work is further ham@@ pered by more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to pump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new type of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement growing in the USA and around the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS were bred and eaten red Roman sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there , it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT department comes from and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that certain plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
but this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seed , cross it to breed their own varieties , and do not cut it off immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
according to him , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , the rights of the farmers , control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasized that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not dealing with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of crops could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says and refers to the ever increasing mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as it is offered on farmers markets in August and September 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to offer their seed freely to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant traits .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing lack of intellectual property rights on plant material .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of the executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ el attributes are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be usable at all or only difficult .
such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salads or car@@ rots .
a question of sight
plants are grown so that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those that improve their taste or colour to such , because they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant traits point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predic@@ able due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to subscri@@ ber C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property supports other breeders because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ etal innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , such protection does not hin@@ der innovation , but promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton looks different : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is , however , that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make farmers work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of patented plant traits : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ p , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures are needed for the cultivation of large @-@ scale her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very timely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as those in international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to are ) own patents , they create most of the smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton believes that by avoiding plant patents breeders would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I &apos;m working with my efforts to produce something new , more powerful than companies that are patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , knowing that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , making it very easy in my opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them in coming to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and selling their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organization Agre@@ e co@@ operates with an open @-@ source licence , which ultimately forms a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding are different from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for Open Source seed systems for which the official launch should be scheduled next year .
a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to see more people soon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has paid particular attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have rarely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5th August , the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them .
in August , the Network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains faithful in spite of this attack and the ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site barriers to the victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no more access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of columns and articles , which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was itself the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of which also has a home blog , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how police practi@@ sed physical violence against two students .
his articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s blocking and reflected what it means to him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) I managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; an arrest , an attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the ban on blo@@ gs as well as any other web site I was working for .
2 ) They have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have an influence , though only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship .
now , however , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
furthermore , af@@ te documented the locking of vendors that was possible by b@@ yp@@ assing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) .
Af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such a practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users might have access to .
the situation is exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day , newspapers in all of Brazil report with glo@@ omy news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The second day a police officer arrives in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ bed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air @-@ port to Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio has reached its highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; in Rio , known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , published the article &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published .
the paper thus asser@@ ted that the motives for their decision were :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from civil@@ ised standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper explained that this decision is not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rocket in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , when distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence can be described as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by Extra when analyzing military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent city in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country , according to statistics from 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is at number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company Glob@@ o is one of the largest media enterprises in South America , which , like C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has reiter@@ ated the state &apos;s security policy for many years .
in addition to these security policy measures , the foundation of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , aims to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police station and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under attack after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles in 2010 , in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - design@@ ating the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also poses serious consequences for the people .
this requires the state to use means and methods that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is now a week ago that the police inv@@ aded the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel controlled areas have been besieg@@ ed by rebel forces outside Damascus , which led people to rely on locally produced or tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods cultivated in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can be planted in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that it has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expresses its relief that it is now becoming more and more well known . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the Can@@ Do humanitarian funding platform called G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families of fung@@ i plant@@ ation , according to Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the writing of this article , they have achieved over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80 % .
due to the shortage of fuel , locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they started with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds coming from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before checking out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , fung@@ i spread all over Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; break@@ age of the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new source of food on the market .
spreading a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creating new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this resulted in the government calling for a state wall of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in Gali@@ cia , Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire erup@@ tions spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached .
in June a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , in Portugal alone around 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can take a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ portu@@ - nat@@ a . ( @ a _ at@@ ula ) October 15 , 2017

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as much as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of open streets surrounded by fires .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened again as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity to be granted if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; continues Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article of P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees made of easily inflamm@@ able wood , spread over and over again , as in a vi@@ cious circle .
to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when inhabitants looked for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative supporting the population with information : it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ go@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers had failed to withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who persecuted the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

two years earlier , a terrible civil war had erup@@ ted between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say that at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe never again .
in the morning , the boy was to break up .
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Haz@@ ara @-@ dominated party Hez@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat had just been assass@@ inated by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Taliban , well @-@ known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found herself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was hard and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and slu@@ gg@@ ish sacks with mort@@ ars who were more difficult than himself to make a living .
back then , as was the case today , the lives of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked .
there were no services and no heating there . we hung nylon before the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left Iran without papers and was ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church which was distributing meals to people in need twice a day .
it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high expectations . however , it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are impro@@ vised bodies in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still apply for months after the asylum application is registered .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so it came to A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible purpose of life helped to liber@@ ate himself soon from these conditions .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af stuck all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast @-@ food snack bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &quot; success story is now the subject of documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates there are about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans living in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans run companies , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ du@@ a the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retailers and return to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are opportunities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happy when I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities like everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity are standing .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
citizen Report : Egypt &apos;s draft bill allow inter@@ connection of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy &apos;s Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Egyptian parliament scrut@@ in@@ ises a bill that fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government agency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
users must be able to use social networks to register within six months of their legal decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months &apos; imprisonment or the payment of a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which has been applied by sixty Par@@ liam@@ entary Members , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a further member of the Euro MP filed a legislative proposal in May , in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced for the insul@@ t of the president or a high ranking official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , however , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
should the law be passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for those convic@@ ted .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photos on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian police , demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inaugur@@ ation of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
during the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in prison for four years in prison .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is facing the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , the fall@@ out from among others weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza condemned the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seating block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ h@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years on 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists to interro@@ gate documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was princip@@ ally interro@@ gated with a triumph@@ ant action plan . according to the plan , it was supported by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , expressly supported a controversial draft bill , accused the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all unused mon@@ ies .
the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at sheds light on how the presidential plans look like supporting the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the attri@@ bution of his sources according to article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
will China comp@@ el users of social media to present their identification ?
according to new regulations of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media .
in the Reg@@ ulations , it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the spread of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and comp@@ el them on request to susp@@ end user data .
this website currently includes websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ chi@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Sper@@ ling Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court decre@@ ed the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as ban in Turkey , after Wikipedia &apos;s administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication stated that the site was blocked because it became &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source working with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries worldwide in which access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain cannot stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week &apos;s reviewed documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
