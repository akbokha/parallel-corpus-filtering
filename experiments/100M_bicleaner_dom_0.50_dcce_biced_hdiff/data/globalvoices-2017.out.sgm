<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run their sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a deep impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington how he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter, who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous plot of an oil magnet, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free from Method You," "" "I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona alone increased my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very schwärmer love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops in his opinion behind the mountain as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people have responded to his statements and voted for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominee.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also, Trumpet Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps Intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced with Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who handled me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with much patience and grace to me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Lecco, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump went on his way to the nominated Republican Presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart of his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016, more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt for non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people have voted for trump because they either shared racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the junk voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters who are most white have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, maybe they wanted to say that they are still important in that country?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to raise a man who looks contemptuously on those who look differently from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(AnW. Ü): white and whiplash based on white and whiplash, as the big van Jones described, has killed exactly what America has made so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - regardless of whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America is welcome to everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan man whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trump, however, a vast majority of the white America gives up this promise and says: to hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, could my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" Mr. Khan asked.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and her voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone not be like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and vocal" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, that is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son fell, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find any place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca province with the children of the Paraguayan town of Cateura in common?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places has not only changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, just 16 miles south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, which is very popular among tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance encounter with a French pilot who launched a musical project and offered the youth a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle and bustle you learn day by day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with remanufactured instruments made from local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chavez have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had seen something that he had never seen before: a violin produced by waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra consisting of instruments made of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic trash-pony) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring performance from trash to music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played its music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork thrive on illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for the shared use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known back then that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it consulted the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilised against the ship. they refused to baptize one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior clerk of the Kenyan fishing authority." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia on the basis of looting the fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal fishing (stop illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are the six countries in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, who then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to track down. therefore illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate breach of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, IUU fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the slug stamp, with the information between individual countries, the actions now happen in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attentively follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in prohibited areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship will load its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the involved vessels have a fishing license, where they were on the road and possibly, if they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships at their ports based on this information, meaning that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "there are considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, managing director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The so-called platform was created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen falling into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, imaginary names, fish protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and exploit the weaknesses of an unbridled control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You cannot run my port." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to Me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole is now trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Up to now, the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It discovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeing ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the International Authority in Countering Crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to track down illegal vessels that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position." "" "and that's what we are trying to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO which also deals with fishery data and provides technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i is designed to help identify criminals with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can actually influence this unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened up the Global Fishing Watch platform, together with Google and the Marine Protection Organization Oceana, a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed by the position of every single trackable ship in the world.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "join with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what - that makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here's a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for research." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global scale." "" "ew Charitable Trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows the tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities are not only detecting criminals but also deterring them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to fuse without license and had little consequence to reckon now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now posted a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats have bought more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to detect Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets where they were forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that other countries now copy us," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars annually disappear by illegal fishing." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined together, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "With safety, the aim is to let even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's most recent member state Somalia reported his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used trawl nets, which are now forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also penetrated into forbidden waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way of working to protect the oceans really works across the oceans.

<seg id="153">"" "" "" "street movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations." ""</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government rejected Venezuela's request for a referendum on a referendum, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into void by gathering in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about: the return of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country, including in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north federal state of Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is worsening continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro; in the end, however, the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, Contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of government decision in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="163">Within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rate belong to the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which there is a grading and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum on tenure for many as the only way to reconquer its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, the demonstrators called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="177">Particularly large waves struck the news about police repression in the centrally located city of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the protesters withdrew to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the police and armed advocates of the government according to its own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of Táchira:</seg>

<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round that forms the scale of repression a day:</seg>
<seg id="183">So the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official opening procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 in Día a Día, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take part in the atrocities at La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now testified in the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">The trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, investigates crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in the La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years, he kept the family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was okay.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Military Service Division in La Perla from 1976 to 1978.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quiños's son, a man who in the course of the years recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and he said before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows what great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a path of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>

<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving licence, witnessed a very unsuccessful translation last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">The Japanese word was presented in a shield like the "older motorists," erroneously - possibly also with malicious mind thoughts & # 8212; translated as "fearful motorists."</seg>
<seg id="349">The incorrect translation was to be read on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a Kyotos citizen. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which was released in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>

<seg id="356">"" "the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "" "terrible drivers" "" "(German:" "" "terrible drivers" "" ") was later replaced by the more appropriate, though grammatically not quite correct term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture continued to apologize for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text she received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt insulted by the insufficient correction (translation) from our side," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News dealt with the phenomenon of "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents all over the country is a reason for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 seniors in 2005, representing a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors grew in the same period.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive knowledge of the language in order to understand the source text and active language skills in order to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators are in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language that could translate translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding of translating, fathoming costs or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees let the translations be made in-house. then the Japanese associate, whose knowledge of English is considered to be the best, is a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sentences and enigmatic sentences that arise by machine translation show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the puzzling prints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood at all.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by big companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source of its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the "Navegar con Libertad" portal (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later on, other users wrote that the internet appearances of VPITV and El Capitolio TV are no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also took footage of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups opposing the Nicolás Maduros government.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in early April, after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, a journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was mapped and recommended to use VPN (virtual private networks) to gain access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenawi: enables your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites of Venezuelan Providers are once again blocked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet site.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially during periods of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEinfile.com later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online broadcasters. this also applies to the Internet site where the National Assembly will transfer its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a site is blocked by the DNS, the server replies miserably or refuses to request a request from such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS barrier: @ elbonoliotv, @ vPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third closed channel, was discontinued on Thursday, 6th April, when the VPITV cameraman Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was imprisoned.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten as he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates internet connections, making the Venezuelans more difficult to access multimedia reporting on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation from university, she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one who has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began working as a Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay there are more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">But what is not mentioned here is that the children have to do countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be charged - and all that is within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected witness testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated to the Cribs is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double illusion," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">"" "on the one hand, the family who decides to take out their education, improve their position in society and" "" "make something out" "" "can be handed over to another family." ""</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family that embraces the girl and justifies its exploitation with the belief that they give someone a chance that otherwise would not receive education and might even be starved.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín came to hospital in Caaguacú, her body showed signs of violent beatings.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military member Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village located 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira started with a stick to Marín until she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the Criadazgo's practice profoundly responsible for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They designated the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there would be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"" "" "" "more cows are registered in Paraguay as children," "" "complained Tina Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to offend unpunished the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Criadite.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be landmark - if for the first time in the Paraguayan history a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are exploited not only as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register for bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all the time and started selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time so that she still had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is adopted, since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities can impose the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>

<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft "stands in accordance with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose minds the control is maximized and that no deviant narration is present on the screen," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which strikes through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, it is between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "is the Persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish eco-system" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a great predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza passionately likes to show a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programmes in Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugwa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi).</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, has been documenting the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "Three Times Catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a state-of-the-art prefecture in Japan, which had to experience both the earthquake and the ensuing tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring countess Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima Prefecture also experienced a nuclear accident, alone that's why 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows, from the local point of view, what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The full report of the newspaper covers both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of the sufferers themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of planned replacement Houses were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was Miyagi, 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed here.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses whereas Fukushima with 70 percent is the final light.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, six years after the catastrophe, even six years after the catastrophe, Evacuated from Behel Meetings (or, Kazetsu prutaku) resettled into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-cavity disaster, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful on this occasion. more than 75 percent of the evacuation, which after the disaster struck in house shelters, were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper, 1074 of 1,100 schools who were affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, the industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the ports in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi could recover 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmland from Fukushima are located in the" "" "nuclear barrier zone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima stays far off.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal residents find it harder to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the paper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuation participants. it questioned them about the state of reconstruction and how their empathy has changed vis-à-vis the tsunami-risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of those surveyed believe that not enough has been done in regard to disaster prevention.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those evacuated from the Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also directed its attention to the situation of the evacuated people from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the devastating earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima's prefecture was also witness to the worst, disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Out of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent substitute houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation centers, which are still in Behel hausen, older than 50 years old, are known to fail because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people from other countries meet people who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities first.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often sees that more connected than it appears at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, broaden our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with topics that get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members remembering a moment when they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music has strengthened the lack of shared language skills during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from around the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back to his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was handed over to the intensive care unit last Friday. last Friday, a police officer had struck him with a strike against his head during a demonstration in Goiânia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators participated in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of Goiás, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him on Saturday and transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local image journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strike. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of Goiás have known that Sampaio was suspended from active service until the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Goiânia with his baton on the face of the student Mateus Ferreira (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landing on the intensive ward, his face would be visible for six months on TV and the entire repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desnealizador," a media activist from Goiânia, shared the video recorded by Luiz Luz on the net in which you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly after him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, has also appeared in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users have donated 10.000 bracelets (about 2,700 Euros) to cover part of the costs for medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiânia while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">Goiás is experiencing a wave of political violence: here, the activist Guilerme Irish was assassinated by his father, because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a Whatsapp group joined the intensive care unit after being attacked by a policeman who struck him with a strike.</seg>

<seg id="615">Goiás was not the only State in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstrators last Friday.</seg>
<seg id="616">Police officers were at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro, where demonstrators built a stage for speakers, rubber bullets and tear gas.</seg>
<seg id="617">The MP, Flavio Serafini, the Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to refrain from violence against protesters via loudspeaker announcements.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso close to hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba concluded the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban Province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - on Spanish sugar mill - notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the framework of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others are resigning and commuting daily to the factories that are still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier-veteran, who runs every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period of time are in operation again because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that Mañalich would get the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry withstood the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the community saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane plants were technically outdated, and hardly competitive were they unsustainable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production target was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar has to remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the 2016 report "Agricultural Issues" by the OECD and FAO, the Agriculture and Food Organization of the United Nations.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"today's day will certainly go into history," that was the first words by Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero.</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane plants, more than 65 million people received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane mill Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he says most is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all the interviewees have the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was a matter of officially written documents, which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was handed over and the letters became more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories which were still in use," he affirms.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, awaits the retirement in another facility, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory in which he helped build.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">Cuba's most developed industrial area and the most important countertops have been wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, no alternatives were created for the jobs and services they generated in the communities in which they were located.</seg>

<seg id="692">Teenagers of the First Nations communities across Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do it using hip-hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the teacher David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree-communities in North Quebec and then worked with the Cree Hip-Hop-Gruppe The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop proposes that young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main performers.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitzumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a road section in Western Canada where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages although the young people do not always speak the languages of the First Nations in native language.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following hymn, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation have recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly from Northstars Hip-Hop-Gruppe, who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the stanza is available in Umschrift, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel as if nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and proceed with our youth as well</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and advocate of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse in syllables (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, what is exactly on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin santou ("plastic models of dishes") of any dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these plastic dishes and decide whether they will enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi there are many small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend transforms them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">Near Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new with plastic dishes coated cell phone tapes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in dietary supplements is becoming increasingly more time-consuming.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we have found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part of the exhibition at Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple which holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comical.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or laughing gas is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with laughing gas?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic meals can also take on a less appetizing form to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and wristbands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other bizarre plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.,.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, then this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi neighborhood, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry, for example with the shokuhin santou.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing persons and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa Cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the mourners or the communities that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político created the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "with the Drug Trafficking"), which is to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people who were caught up in the fight between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire congregations have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear life changed" "" ") tells exactly those stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who scans secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews on only one single day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have asked ourselves to go and to search for graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>

<seg id="771">You are entitled to the insurance of my father, but they are not paid out because they require a death certificate.</seg>
<seg id="772">"" "where should we get them?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensation-journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with images, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from files by specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the lampstand.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it acts as a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or look at this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues writing:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the futility of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring town can be justified by the fact that they were" "" "wet" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not moving and still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: how a family with threats has been plundered." it describes how armed criminals were forced to make money from their business every month until they destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain will never pass away, the trauma remains, fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">I asked myself in these terrible days whether tears would disintegrate my deep-rooted emotions, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to cry. I must learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, warm tortillas and make "Chichi" for the babies that live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier when he was only a couple of blocks away from his home, saw the bloody corpse of his father, which had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, as a result of organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world based on the number of murders according to the Government of Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 killings.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," the 2015 animal Político established the data journalism project Narcodata, which aims to portray the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing a falsification.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the years after something has appeared the first time? content in social media, whether true or false, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been misleading to identify tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false link between picture and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010 a tank car crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes, which were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank car fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Local authorities described a fireball, which covered dozens of houses, including a movie near which was full of people who watched the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to unrecognizability.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "That is Nigeria." from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident will depict the dreadful scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been tipped several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastic atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "nobody was left to count bodies," "" "said a resident to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been cut in pieces, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The following time could only be depicted on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military of Nigeria and the attempt of the Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from DR Congo emerged again when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example falsely falsely relate the image from DR Congo to sources of mass media in order to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a Blitzkrieg, published by the United Nations, those who could escape were beaten, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported the violence against Rohingya, posts resembled the following, which brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news page falsely claiming that Myanmar's president has said that monks and politicians were involved in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, they had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was recently accessed on April 26, 2017, can be viewed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news agencies referred to AFP as their source have also wrongly attributed Than to this statement, but had not brought the picture from DR Congo in connection with it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The worldwide reach of false information</seg>
<seg id="860">Traces of these false couplings date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="861">Using an inverted image search, you can see how far information can transcend boundaries.</seg>
<seg id="862">An inverted picture search with the search engine TinEye has found 344 pictures (as of May 3, 2017) 344 pictures, which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo.</seg>
<seg id="863">They come from a mix of private sites, platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages, including English, Russian, Spanish, Arabic, Dutch, German, Greek and Portuguese.</seg>
<seg id="864">Some have passed false reports, occasionally others have tried to expose the falsifications.</seg>
<seg id="865">We have delimited examples of the abusive usage and associated them with the respective countries based on what side they had been published. thus, we want to present the range more clearly than by the language alone.</seg>
<seg id="866">From the below listed countries (which are also linked to one another in some cases), several examples may be used for abuse.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page wrongly claimed that the president of Myanmar managed his 2012, that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from Sange.</seg>
<seg id="910">The article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this release the picture is still contained in it.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students encircled by Boko Haram released from the news page Análisis Digital published now, has expressly declared that the image does not come from the killings, but it claims that it represents a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="914">Turkey, 2015. "# NijeryaYanıyorDünyaUyuy" (Nigeria burns, the world sleeps).</seg>
<seg id="915">The image of the DR Congo submerged with this Twitterhashtag, and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Hebdo in Paris.</seg>
<seg id="916">They wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam.</seg>
<seg id="917">USA, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9.300 times retweetted), but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>

<seg id="921">After a message purported to circulate by a "Father Juan Carlos Martos" about the Nigerian massacre, discussion forums such as this were in Vietnamese and declared it to be false.</seg>

<seg id="926">In all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture may ultimately have a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible.</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that permeate these posts, the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used for greater discussion about the silence related to the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the murders of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of thousands of people who inadvertently take part in drinking water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggest this mood of misinformation and misinformation that actual atrocities are untrue and demises the actual horror of what is actually happening in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that the retention of images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, the concern is that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and depriving them of the ability to empathize empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent depictions in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that can actually be used away from context or entirely abusive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. irreplaceable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well known today (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobremesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all stubbornly resist any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes context is required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online-list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the VAT-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"" "" "" "vakasteglok" "" "- Rooking your parents in recognition of how they have tried to care for you in recent years." ""</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsetry language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the ease or laziness that you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this site want to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressively these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="972">Following a response from the disaster relief centre of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people have been killed and almost a hundred people are missing because of floods and sludge charges.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of stay.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls continued on Saturday (May 27), and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased.</seg>

<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims" that have built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They have abused me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice different religions.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim, to different kinds. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, like I do not fit in there, are unconscionable.</seg>
<seg id="1010">Abdominals are being mashed</seg>

<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Qur'an and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western notion the religion of Rumis was deleted, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting constitutes a major part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narration fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their veil in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian, Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="1037">We also create narrations which help us understand the world.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it, consciously and unconsciously to solidify the "other"; just as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake feeds, while he already encapsulates countries and "other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to get and appreciate the variety of languages of big cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk is that small and not quite so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project the following applies:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening to it often is connected with understanding," "" "these events are used instead" "" "listening to appreciate, to feel, to make." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, historians tell their story initially in their own language and then translate or explain it in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their devotion and their interpretation lead to the audience entering into it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They provoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the story-teller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyaphiti tells the tale of rabbits and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyaphiti is asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">They have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were alert...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers are hoping to expand this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling performances.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-audit of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to $72 million, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march started at the puertorides Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">She was called "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (citizen's front for the re-examination of debt) and the ecumenical church meeting in Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-fixing of debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico are demanding that the politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt will be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>

<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publisher of book Sprints' finished books produced within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and available here royalty-free includes a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real cost to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom, and instantly.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have let us begin to think about their own fate, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment.</seg>
<seg id="1202">"" "his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "" "Military Police Pasha on the basis of a" "" "strictly secret" "" "command of the military court from his cell in Adra." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that on 12 November 2015 she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts and conditions remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project founded by Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Maybe none of them was looking forward to cultural prototypes than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architecture mixes with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time, Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would do everything possible to wipe out this architecture that not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet finished this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent all my life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He taught me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prostitute, which she wrote in the years 2012-2015 to her husband when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic to English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">"" "" "" "Mozambique reacted with anger on a case of corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus at which corruption was committed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other accused of abscattering 54 million metics (around 800,000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released for good lead in 2016 and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not undergo any disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants don't mean the action good.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and underlines the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we notice is that the company should have initiated a disciplinary proceedings against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">However, the company apparently kept silent and did not take appropriate legal action to apply the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "repulsive" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to inflict damage.</seg>

<seg id="1272">Cambaza was rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone was rewarded in such a way that already insulted the state so massively.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morality and to serve the state, * he had already a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead serves himself only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as a source of an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself became tired of this man who was charged and sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>

<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpea or splitting blower." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network shared their posts because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still debated, it is usually used to refer to people of East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censuses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "in Burmese script" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Calar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically provoke hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored for its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Moreover, there are several Burmese words with fundamentally different meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (spine), 'Kalar OAT' (Kamel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The facilitator Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today, because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet considers that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it solves all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write to factorook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting bsen).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who disseminate hate speech, have received quite a good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise your nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who hate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply going to use a new word or an alternative spelling of censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from browsing, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author shared his views on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "in addition it seems as if they started it without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely solved posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them great sales, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship provided much ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now making fun of Facebook and deliberately write 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken off the grid.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that did not contain hate speech, but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "only to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and their influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should also stimulate the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where clashes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for its failure to control the balancing hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar' it would have looked better, rather in context than concentrating on code, and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>

<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017 the bill against the child marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent one who contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypass tools for blocked web pages (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocks of the Internet have been taking place since 2007 after the Internet law (no. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">One solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid out all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is nevertheless callable despite legal ban.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After we have heard the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we put everything in mind to put the snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents in a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least look at all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the site www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has brought both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiLeaks, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when the respective country Wikipedia is banned.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access a different URL, which is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server further directs the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">A refreshing Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera with him and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly I called myself to Navaraj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti River.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to snapping pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen understanding for the fact that wild animals are not as fearsome as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he was already standing face to face with Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the book was appearing. he sat down immediately, we looked at us and he stares at me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for conservation) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Otters in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accomodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally released on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was republished here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid speaking with the greatest care, the name of their husbands, or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure, they should respect the husband, as well as fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, maintain this practice in life.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was expelled from the Indian state of Odisha by a mock tribunal and was infringed by her family and the village community after addressing a married relative with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives apart from their names is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear if at all they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, came to a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs there in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the Video Volunteers community and sets up for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paola has been working with her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices such as children's marriage up to the banishing of HIV and AIDS infected and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs create a safe place for these women and have made them ambassadors of the changes at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion rounds were women who didn't name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud is a custom that they have all committed dutifully and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Raw ini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is regarded as deceitful, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought of this until this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name of her husband, wanted to try out at home how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband were silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on with his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, were protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Then she asked all, "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," "" "says Rohini Paola from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking up a centuries-old tradition where married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she chained only in front of her during the whole exercise; another decided to let out the complete frustration of him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the rush of adrenaline about having broken with an ancient tradition, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands in their name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Rohini received a lot of reports in the coming days.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop telling his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law she stared at her, she was frightened and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was based on violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the scinox-red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I told my husband that I would carry the zinapian red point if he did.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He just laughed and I stopped bearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not stopped completely, but think they are now in a better position to choose to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the Discussion Club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip with every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear something," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cake for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are tied to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel discussion we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most that's okay, but some wanted to wear a salad-kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of controversy and discussion about the advantages of the choice of clothes, the morality combined with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own couple Kurtas (shirts) into a discussion round, so that the women could carry them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they'll manage it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the question whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, Rohini assures that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">"" "" "" "we have done little steps so far." ""</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped to say the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including myself, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their life - like the haggling about more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini Explained:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail trade Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! the day today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan. for more than 51 years ago, they were here in Tokyo.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald persons for organ trading, presumably for disbelievers, worried the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milton, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they confessed that the organs of shamans were used in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can bring gold or wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC explained.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, which is the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1596">Beware of bald men who travel to Mozambique. bald men in Mozambique are the target of ritualistic attacks, warned the Muslim police according to the latest assassinations of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milton, where the killings took place.</seg>

<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The prosecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mortbala, Province of Zambézia, for presumably disbelievers rituals, has cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM) which also acknowledges that a faith exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made only recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo drew attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized because of liver cancer at the terminal stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years in prison for "subversion" (state jeopardizing) after participating in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China referred to Lius case as an "internal matter" and told a spokesman that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">However, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely avoided the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has consolidated some international reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations - united nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to make Liu a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway in Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway fell staggering after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it did not end up with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China, as exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After spreading the news that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately release Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top-ranking diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius as she announced in an explanation on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to abolish all restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are meant to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans" "" "wish him the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as he helps him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the U.S. Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to release his wife Liu Xia from their house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the U.S. Embassy summoned a furious response from China, with the statement of the State Department that" "" "No country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible comments on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley stated that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of its choice, which they claim according to Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources in Peking told Reuters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vortex of Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on China to provide Liu with appropriate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always monitored the room in hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression and freedom to exercise these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France in France</seg>
<seg id="1669">On 29 June, France's Foreign Office urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments that he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome the Liu government in the country, the State Department announced that there was no further information whether France would ultimately receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Floor system Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of Arlandings in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who advocate peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also urged China to allow sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual guide in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in an explanation on June 28 around Liu and stated that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for whom he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">The world is Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Licence: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This statement sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of meeting the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog" "" "Cavalierio" "" "accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "turn logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you're not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons quoted by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of this, it inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently managed by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the topic, the good old lyre comes up again from the authoritarian rulers to be the democrats, leaving the distorted logic as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given by Shanmugam in the last week were really non-answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He was able to answer such questions in a rational way with non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng asks Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point in case he was highly paid to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out as to the critics that one should begin to read the entire manuscript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of Shanmugam testimonies, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "as a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections were so unimportant even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as the leader of an adolescent generation makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what awaited me - whether I agree or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes that is really associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review discovers the vulnerabilities of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "make good faith a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, which country are the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the cabinet, Mr. Shanmugam comments are of grave importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they defend their city not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our Prime Minister pay for bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>

<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I did not say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians may cook inwardly when they are kept for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know himself, there is little that separates us Canadians from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1771">Being harmless means being inconspicuous and uninteresting and not paying attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to remain unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>

<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video also indirectly refers to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>

<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "Der Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai policies, in particular as regards the situation of the country under the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the Commander-in-Chief of the Army an absolute decision making over important national issues." ""</seg>

<seg id="1795">Two days later, there was a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the Junta is still pursuing is to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black van before putting them into an internment repository, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened long sentences, they should offend the monarchy.</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on April 19, 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and will be published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">On the path of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brill frame and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Afrika.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Ms Ramírez tells the people to get into full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Afrika!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mother Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have also been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys drugs that they cannot pay, she massaging them with a balm the shots exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramirez.</seg>

<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao is travelling with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and her three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull towards north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "" "mum Afrika is a well-known name on the track," "" "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells us that the Haitians and Africans travel together often together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards in order to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramirez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mum Afrika is our mother and we never let her go again," "" "he says, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez says that her guests often send out text messages when they left to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chickens like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city there is a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I've seen what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After living there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes to them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he had fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and tries to decide where to go the next step.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in Mama Africa's house everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the aisles, travelers will calmly consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full but it is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandma, she browses in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair care that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, as she introduces it to me briefly.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The residents of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On 10 July, mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi obtained a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities wanted to use the app for more than the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia ten Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group shortly after they installed the app.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"" "in the communication of the police state that the app would detect and follow the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" "" "illegal religious" "" "activities and" "" "harmful information" "" "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents." ""</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online scams, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can, of course, be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person home network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notions about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censuses and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlet "Images from mainland China," which is based on Twitter, published censored news in China, displayed photos from a checkpoint where police inspectors checked the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiang make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected in a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are meant for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the physical surveillance technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (RUB) also published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the spread of illegal contents.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All branches of government, authorities and affiliated organizations, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">The authorities in Xinjiang published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the order to leave their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole series of other possible offences, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2055">This was the secret of the secret: in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from freeing the traitors and terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawite dialect - so they played out their confessional blackmailing list and betrayed the narrow field of view of their view of the world.</seg>

<seg id="2061">I really can't say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary means of communication for me.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to punishment, although I did nothing to deserve this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this lovingly "confession."</seg>

<seg id="2069">Give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot keep your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2070">My screams were not enough for him, so they exchanged the tube through a cable.</seg>

<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them changed, while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">I had lost any sense in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emslam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emslam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he looses to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his nicotine-stained lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaib's family to escape from their village in Palestine in which they had lived as feluyeen (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned her old-tried opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls out the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are relevant not only in his home town of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as a person who is not restricted by borders in his thinking, and according to his own statement, he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating effects of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special aversion to US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe his compassion for those seeking to survive in war zones, to do anything with his identity as "Palestinian fledacious of the second generation," he describes himself, even though he was born in Jordan, and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "says Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man," "" "while he pours down Nescafé in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with age-old traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a senseless hot junta has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the swarms of lukewarm coffee and the squadron of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan is like a prison under the open sky, especially when you look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just as to drink water in the public during Ramadan - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou 'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former press spokespersons of the Islamic coalition, Dima Tahboub, said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been canceled because of the sexual orientation of the singer." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that question the old approved legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila invaded the Jordanian people as a "progressive supporter of human rights," who still decided to advocate an intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simply rhetoric, but in fact reflected a increasingly clear-crystallized reality in Jordan which clearly appears in Hdaib's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib decreased traditional gender standards by educating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently worn unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of "honorable morse" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honourable killings reached its peak in 2016; however, it is still alarming that Jordan does not have the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a 1954 law crime control law, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "indefinitely be held in prison," and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from themes that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come out of the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been attuned to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sed," Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, one verse repeats strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words, "get what you want" - either faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about gay rights and lesbians' rights and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember later that his comments were torn, twisted and censored according to his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but streamed was only a edited version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly campaigns for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhich, a poet of the eighth century, who still remains in memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuova, who was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordan do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite Kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service established several former members of the government and members of the Association of Teachers, arguing that they had criticised social media commentaries on the problems connected with the corruption deep in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaib's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has prevented Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - is made up of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"" "he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" "" "experiencing them" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially created democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until this is done, Hdaib will continue to rap and, consequently, resists resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which Aman enrolled as a student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">"" "Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the festive carriages, drums and dancing have been handed down over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies of the West of Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emise, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seating, so we got a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gayoen, organised a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literal).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gayoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">However, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely were external appearances and body care as important as in this story, as they help keep the Peruvian youth out of criminality and promote a legitimate profession like the hairdresser's.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima's capital - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robberies and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region is not safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend to copy the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led more and more normal citizens to embark on the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these lavish hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which goes to the ultimate limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the Friseure du Batalla de Barberos, which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks from them, as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against barber tools and instead of poor advice to get an education in hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love with the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine" "" "Tea AfterTwelve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel outright?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Bogotic Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation left the head and inspired them to the campaign Cartas por la Carliación (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the point of view of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">Internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried their arms around the clock, now have to integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take these into their ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian convinced the young Colombians to join together and help the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that is exactly what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters in order to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter, who will be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">He explained that we write thousands of letters of love to the people whom we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He continued to tell us this year to share his love with people who needed the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus arose the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC soldiers who now have to find their place in society and build up a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2,000 letters have been collected within the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were delivered on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt Foundation traveled to the camp to transfer the letters in person.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set themselves up as they had done before in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in-between," the Political Science student Manuela Jiménez Avila told later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters lived) I saw a guerilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed was a MGL grenade, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "he answered," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he answered," "" "I am responding to a letter someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never in my life has someone written something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "then suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly and placed me beside the garnet-launchers.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was also tired of the war, was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning students and some of the FARC leaders came to a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already at war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State affected the whole Colombian people. now that we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "the aim of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear those people who had never heard before and had no right to vote and realize that the people I often saw as monsters and hated even people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would reign after disarming.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to take up arms, raise up and protest for their rights. and that is also completely justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC are now set on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call on all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and make sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will be faced with many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2262">When I was just going to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a man's voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnyan:" "" "how long will you still dishonour the family, you stain?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I just know it was a young man, not thirty years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital in the last analysis.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stabs in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which cases were you laid down - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and appealed to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful to him for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time in his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for treating me with respect.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya in order to prove that it was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set absurd demands: some told me that I had to prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender, that everything was just bad news and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have particle size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world that has shamed not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activist friends checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help, I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought them without registering with me, without identification, without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">In the moment I wanted to call my mother per WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you're safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we don't talk about gender equality, it is a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this pastoral barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera I actually make effort to look at the person she remembers from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For that I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has been in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not lock a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">That is what I mean, they probably invite relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still being held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to submit themselves to Kadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that one can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "should they be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but purposefully submerged in order to radicalise itself.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was incarcerated in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known all over Grosny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In seriousness!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer at that time than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally wanted to introduce us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but eventually turned us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had tinted eyelashes, wore blue jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Defense of Sharia has never curled me even one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means:" "" "rot is not about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of sick people.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They have never insulted me, never hunted and never defeated.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace season last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behaviour of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how people in the city began to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed before and laughed at first looked at you with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">At that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the republic constantly worsened.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you now pursue?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize tea vessels, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have not paid a cent for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people by themselves when I cleared the type of flood.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Nature is so, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chetschenen, who want to make you know with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays on them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestan have what the Kabardines have, the Russians also have what; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims walking in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think of transition to men who love men, and they believe that you change his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all for that - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the indigenous Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong increase in suicide.</seg>

<seg id="2399">Photo: usage with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man named Jassim Moramazon on August 27 came into the spotlight the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the Southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed for his own helplessness, inability for his family to rise, so Ahwazi-human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had lit himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors were unable to do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi Minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month saw some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families on the basis of the prosecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi settled in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it hard for the indigenous Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy in Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime is systematically rejecting the Ahwazi Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab areas to the Persian provinces, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravating the devastation caused by drought, and destroying local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawi adolescents has now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the director of Iran for cooperatives, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of Ahwazis who were looking for a job had completed primary school, 55% completed secondary school leaving 45% university degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy" "" "aimed at eliminating the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestor human rights activist living in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not preference to recruit Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi will be deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and compel them to earn their living outside their home of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name in order to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and be hired as even Arabic names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances the Arab Ahwazi has to bear, human rights activists are beating the alarm before the situation will explode.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is awake and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and published on the Afroféminas website. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all women.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am suffering doubly and threefold among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin color, on black transgender women, on black transgender women, on black women in LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused with racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists and white intersectional feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Yet they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift their voices" and "Kumbaya, my Lord" to sing "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about sexualised violence as an institutionalized form of racial violence, which we face black women in a twofold manner.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women from other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black sphere and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of having domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all people of any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I cannot join as a black woman in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking, which refer to both sex and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer have to fight for my membership in a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a demented and marginalised being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that, through cultural appropriation, absorb our customs and customs in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women appreciate the importance of the overlapping of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to instruct them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and distinguish itself from the white feminism, there is still the word "feminism" in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself wholeheartedly from feminism and join the movement of Womanism, called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we black women define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and where the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement that the black woman is concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognised as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can bloom in an environment in which my life is neither bypassed, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by the curator. the article is part of the series # PorSerMujer (# weireinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman appeared in Balbuena for mistreatment, Ada Báez did not use the Ada Báez 'knowledgeable display.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman withdrew her advert.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women make an advert at all, they generally do not receive support from the State.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, the women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to being victims of violence can report at all to law enforcement agencies.</seg>
<seg id="2489">Inhalt1 Strips and statistics 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does nothing under Paraguays's laws: good base, poor implementation of strokes and statistics</seg>
<seg id="2490">It is difficult to find out how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a socio-scientific research institution in Paraguay. "there are various statements and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney Office found out 9600 ads on domestic violence, with 70% of them fighting for violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5,000 advertisement for domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of the advertisements of women came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the advertisements, 40% of women claimed that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">However, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "on any woman who has been notified in Paraguay for psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "two women who do not do this are entitled to any woman who fails to report on physical abuse," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners each year.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016, journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that does nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. this should repent her forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured mental violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of maltreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient because they are fooled by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they liked this so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of ill-treatment had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you"), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's indications with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an impermeable legal fight between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill introduced under the hashtag # PorEllas (# pres) was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-eWenders) are part of a Twitter campaign backed by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law stipulates that Female is to be declared a criminal offence and to punish harsher as is the case already in neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus, the legal text was changed in some points in order to win MPs for the law, which feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions banned in Paraguay is generally prohibited and punishable by up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had intended to impose the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must carry themselves, if they simply want to reimburse them and receive a secure accommodation to the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">There must be a change of thinking, so that violence is no longer considered to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts will complicate and contribute to the fact that the perpetrators will be punished.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we have to reimburse such a long time until ill-treatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. previously, parts of the law were altered, including a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence called for reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The Reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is regarded as a major setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "this website has been banned because of a resolution by the Minister of Information" "" "is to be found on the website of the banned newspaper Azamn." ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn for their reporting on corruption in the Sultanate.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, is still in prison, where he is serving a year-old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and put on trial, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after leaving his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, alongside his role as the single sultan, he has held the most important positions in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's regime is characterised by the persistent efforts of the security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, public freedoms, including freedom of the press, restrictions and torture of human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to freely express their views on the country's public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on Azamn, its closure, and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper in which since its inception in 2007 about corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) was reported until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On 28 July 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, chief editor of Azamn, arrested, after an article entitled "High-ranking parties in the hands of the judiciary" was published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report, government officials were accused of pressuring the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman to suspend a ruling in an inheritance dispute.</seg>

<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, Zaher Al-Abri, member of the Editorial Board, was invited to the special department from the ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, ISS captured the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who acted as editor-in-chief according to Al-Maamaris's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The paper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that "the publication and dissemination of the newspaper in any way, including online, banned from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the Trial Chamber held the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both condemned, among other things, for disruption of public order, "abuse of the Internet" and "undermining of the Present of the State."</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, Al-Haj was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slander.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years "imprisonment and fines in the amount of 3,000 US dollars each (7800 US dollars).</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year of prison and a fine of 1,000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network for the dissemination of material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For al-Abri, a bail was set in the amount of $5000 ($13,000) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016, but sentenced Al-Haj to a year and al-Maamari to six months in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six-month jail sentence from the central prison in Maskat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he is serving his year-old prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper "Azamn."</seg>
<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to leave Azamn again, the paper continues to be exposed to attacks by the Andean government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further order in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and the Minister again postponed the decision of the Appeals Court to allow the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The permanent closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the freedom of the press in Oman has recently been violated.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatin and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the country's first independent online newspaper to cease its operations.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detention of journalist Al-Haj, the impression that the Afghan authorities are still unwilling to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (GCHR) calls on the Afghan authorities to:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. Yousef Al-Haj immediately and unconditionally released;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the paper Azamn, so that their journalists can pursue their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. protect the freedom of the press in the country and</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture takes place with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media, and it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research conducted on site: firstly, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more grave impact in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment in researching these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists itself helps build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic had first serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently running a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GA: what do you think are the most important current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain the recipient rather than being a creator himself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not good in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GA: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GA: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GA: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion of the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, study of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GA: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it's the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred Salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own resourcefulness and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only to individual types, but also for certain characteristics, such as resistance to diseases, special red or green tongs or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more patents have been applied to more and more plants, such as cereals or cartels. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security in the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate advocate of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but in the meantime he needs longer, since his work is further hampered by more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like a boulder in a river that I have to pump." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new type of lettuce, because all features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and strives not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement growing in the USA and around the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS were bred and eaten red Roman salat of the variety Outreddish in the "glasshouse" of the station. there, it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT department comes from and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that certain plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">But this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others who buy their seed, cross it to breed their own varieties, and do not cut it off immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, the rights of the farmers, control of the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasized that the "open-source" movement is not dealing with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of crops could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," he says and refers to the ever increasing mergers in the global agricultural industry, as it is offered on farmers markets in August and September 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without a seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to offer their seed freely to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant traits.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing lack of intellectual property rights on plant material.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director of the executive director of Ossi, engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all cartel attributes are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be usable at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">Such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby suggest that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salads or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of sight</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they have specifically desired characteristics - from those that improve their taste or colour to such, because they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant traits point out that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predicable due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto subscriber Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property supports other breeders because" "" "patents and the protection of plant varietal innovations promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "thus, such protection does not hinder innovation, but promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton looks different: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is, however, that genetic resources have always been a common good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to make farmers work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will make us impossible if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton interferes with the concept of patented plant traits: "we do not really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Depp, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for the cultivation of large-scale herbicides, which breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very timely." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such as those in international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) own patents, they create most of the smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salad in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton believes that by avoiding plant patents breeders would be more innovative: "it looks like I'm working with my efforts to produce something new, more powerful than companies that are patented.</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "I constantly need new material for my catalogue, knowing that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years," "" "he says." "" "with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, making it very easy in my opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a "open-source" seed program.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them in coming to" "" "open source" "" "seeds and selling their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German organization Agree cooperates with an open-source licence, which ultimately forms a formal and legally binding form of Ossi's commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding are different from country to country, which is why the Ossi obligation cannot be easily adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest aims of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">"" "" "" "the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet." ""</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5th August, the Egyptian government locked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports above them.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the Network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains faithful in spite of this attack and the ridicule of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law and give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of web site barriers to the victim. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no more access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles, which he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was itself the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of which also has a home blog, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reported about the student protests and recorded a video on how police practised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles focus mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government's blocking and reflected what it means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) I managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; an arrest, an attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the ban on blogs as well as any other web site I was working for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have an influence, though only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Furthermore, afte documented the locking of vendors that was possible by bypassing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice points to the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population does not have a legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army in the Favelas in Niterói, a town in Rio de Janeiro State, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in all of Brazil report with gloomy news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"" "" "" "14-year-old shot in school," "" "The second day a police officer arrives in Rio de Janeiro," "" "Thieves robbed pharmacy with military weapons," "" "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and air-port to Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio has reached its highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In this way, the newspaper "Extra" in Rio, known for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, published the article "This is not normal" in which it announced a new section called "War in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now being published.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper thus asserted that the motives for their decision were:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crimes, etc. everything that deviates from civilised standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper explained that this decision is not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rocket in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper declares that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when distorted, can also be used to disguise atrocities of the police who only shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence can be described as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated by Extra when analyzing military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro als" "" "the most violent city in Brazil" "", "according to Cecília," "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country, according to statistics from 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders per state, Rio is at number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">The company Globo is one of the largest media enterprises in South America, which, like Cecília, has reiterated the state's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">In addition to these security policy measures, the foundation of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, aims to capture a favela by deploying a massive police station and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under attack after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that were supposed to protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles in 2010, in which he explains why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention - designating the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also poses serious consequences for the people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and methods that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," in which a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week ago that the police invaded the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident also made headlines: a fruit salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Eastern Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel controlled areas have been besieged by rebel forces outside Damascus, which led people to rely on locally produced or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian volunteers and academics teaches the inhabitants of Eastern Ghoutas, as they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods cultivated in Syria and are only extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their nutritional value makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can be planted in houses and basements."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that it has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expresses its relief that it is now becoming more and more well known. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the CanDo humanitarian funding platform called Ghira Alnahda in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families of fungi plantation, according to Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the writing of this article, they have achieved over 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and the humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Due to the shortage of fuel, locally produced fuels from plastic are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr Leila told Global Voices that they started with the" "" "production of fungal seeds coming from the regions" "" "before checking out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2821">"" "now they have designed a" "" "educational farm for the region" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after 3 months, fungi spread all over Eastern Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this resulted in the government calling for a state wall of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in Galicia, Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire eruptions spreading in the northern and central regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages reached.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images, in Portugal alone around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2851">In addition, building permits are questioned in locations with a high risk of fire.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had introduced to serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees made of easily inflammable wood, spread over and over again, as in a vicious circle.</seg>
<seg id="2855">To these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when inhabitants looked for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative supporting the population with information: it took advantage of its own civil protection data using the application fogo.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers had failed to withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who persecuted the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found herself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was hard and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and sluggish sacks with mortars who were more difficult than himself to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, as was the case today, the lives of Afghan refugees in Iran were marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating there. we hung nylon before the open windows, so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left Iran without papers and was ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church which was distributing meals to people in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high expectations. however, it is also true that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation" "" "Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres." "" "these are improvised bodies in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which can still apply for months after the asylum application is registered.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so it came to Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible purpose of life helped to liberate himself soon from these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf stuck all his savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast-food snack bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis "success story is now the subject of documentary" Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy "(German:" behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy ") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates there are about 20,000 Afghans living in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of the Afghans run companies, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience, where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant is told by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retailers and return to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are opportunities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happy when I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for peasants from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities like everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul in which people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surplus on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity are standing.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, which protested against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacy's Netizen report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "" "" "the Egyptian parliament scrutinises a bill that foresees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after registering with a government agency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users must be able to use social networks to register within six months of their legal decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to six months' imprisonment or the payment of a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which has been applied by sixty Parliamentary Members, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "a further member of the Euro MP filed a legislative proposal in May, in which tougher penalties would be introduced for the insult of the president or a high ranking official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, however, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, so legal experts of Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">Should the law be passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for those convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who took photos on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of Egyptian police, demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the inauguration of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">During the same incident, Shawkan was waiting for four years in prison for four years in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May, because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is facing the death penalty due to one, so many human rights groups agree, the fallout from among others weapons possession, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza condemned the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their coverage of the pro-Morsi seating blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakhany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years on 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to interrogate documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was principally interrogated with a triumphant action plan. according to the plan, it was supported by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, expressly supported a controversial draft bill, accused the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of corruption, provided they return all unused monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the website of Nawaat sheds light on how the presidential plans look like supporting the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the attribution of his sources according to article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared in the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Will China compel users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the Regulations, it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roskomnadzor WeChat failed to register with the state government as" "" "organizer of the spread of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law from 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing content and compel them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">This website currently includes websites such as Vkontakte and Odnochiki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
