this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to Americans from Americans .
but there is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. secret service operation , in which the CIA literally gave Iran a blu@@ epr@@ int for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for nearly 10 years , the government has investigated Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave re@@ porters did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lives with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they mentioned for years that it was imperative in their case , the demands of the government to crack down .
the reason : during the period of electronic surveillance , the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
rather than reti@@ ring and ris@@ king , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his phone calls secret ,
just like his email data , financial and bank information , his credit card , and even travel links with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all US governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional complaint , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy out all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as government technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and ad@@ mitt@@ edly , they can do that from the moment they get in contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that did not exist when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than regular emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , like the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is , however , only a small part of the whole in order to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger all of us .
it is up to us to ensure that not only technology experts like Edward Snow@@ den have a way to off@@ end mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental contribut@@ or who strikes the alert for the polluted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Pap@@ ers revealed that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news of a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has led to the very first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has phil@@ atel@@ ic companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , through a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next disclosed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
it appears weeping from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for major public services such as healthcare , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
media and leading politicians all over the world discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but by the principle after which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples of connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US states , less information is needed , less information must be given to form a company than to get a library card .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator came out as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked us that everyone except one lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer money to our investig@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these prosec@@ ut@@ ors accepted us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single lawyer who has made proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single leading politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about how the system works , through the corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior harder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very stub@@ born as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I can see that some things have begun to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have seen an unprecedented level of transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been operating in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them .
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is behind this .
representatives of both parties have submitted a draft law in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure more transparency in the US and globally .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need executives in the economy who stand up and say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the lack of transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
one day after completing my design studies , I made a res@@ eller sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was getting late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Where are you going to sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he actually plans it . I don &apos;t want to land ab@@ duc@@ ted in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small boot !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard that : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get there ?
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I stepped out of bed , sne@@ aked at ti@@ the tips to the door , and shut down my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me today hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
maybe the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to accommodate people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate withdraw@@ s and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something for it . our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so @-@ called &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure that our cheese @-@ ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we left our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started star@@ ing .
had we just discovered that at the same time we were able to find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ ak@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept .
thus we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting .
via the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the rocket to light .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we have all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things that you can do well . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it &apos;s the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we were aiming for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
next , enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left @-@ sitting neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic that you feel right now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just like that , who actually has Al G@@ ores mobile phone ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build up . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you had 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to release your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests submitted their assessments before placing them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are about age and residence .
we trust the most similar to the people who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation wre@@ aks simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can afford .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; great works of art in your apartment ! I make a holiday with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
all our company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to dispro@@ ve these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not previously covered .
for us , business is just going very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only one fraction of the 123 million spent over@@ nights had one problem .
for people were right to trust one another .
if trust works , it can result in wonderful things .
one of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers inclined to heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who can save life even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive a car in your own car when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want one to feel lonely , they bring books .
they let you stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions go together ?
it is a matter of economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but just call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not justified . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; share Economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; describes a trade that promises human relationships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people are making a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visit , a group of Ans@@ wers would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which you have never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing together ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isol@@ ation@@ ism .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . lots of parking spaces included in the government ,
were offered now residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were sent to people whose children had been moved out . incub@@ ator programmes started ,
in order to be able to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or even host .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality has existed before .
there were already similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted pre@@ concep@@ tions .
I think it &apos;s amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes through me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think of when you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media represent people that look like me .
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ te myself .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was that at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence , and compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , I was able to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow devotion , deep@@ ening herself with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I see myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel someone you perceive you fully understand , and yet loves somehow ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
I was sitting in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking News . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock was quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should this be done ?
I changed the television channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern origin ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , ... &quot; ... Bom@@ bs Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
it was not only my country being attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start with post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I drove -- as we drove silence -- so deep it went to my seat , and I was the first time feared to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ y in well @-@ lit areas &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not miss &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warning lou@@ dly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were considered Muslims to burst into the open .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked the country attacked our country .
I have critic@@ ised the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nowadays we can actually hear people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we release them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and make mos@@ ques .
they talk about my community like a tumor in the US body .
the only question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is kept under observation .
the alternatives are useless because the question is false .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic med@@ als .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces available , but not stopping terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more tolerant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and like me , a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
as a first person , the person is cut off from their community , even by their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts of the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make brain washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or dis@@ liked by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must encourage people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you look at them , they do not do what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality which allows them to read these things into scrip@@ ture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every priest who had spoken to them brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing , and something that would have made sense of their anger , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised to solve a solution .
this Ima@@ m resum@@ ed the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using her of her anger , he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que did not forbi@@ d the IS to join the IS .
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of anxiety affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- shows : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian regime of government , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce .
one study shows that if people submit messages in which negative about Muslims have been reported , they are more likely to accept military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of American Muslims &apos; rights .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims shot upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction on Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool for the manipulation of the public to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
when assign@@ ing collective debt , it &apos;s not just about having to explain yourself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did my brother become such an accomplished young man ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , has murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon .
he shot himself eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision as it was about which America we wanted to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , took off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw made me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled people were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had demonstrated courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe ?
or you will join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what would you say to those who might claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a mind@@ set with depth , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m perfectly normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I &apos;m not an exception in any way .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ packages rush into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the public . a few years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight machines achieve high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test of spaces .
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to exceed the limits of possibility within the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must collectively know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine on @-@ board calculations what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
like other Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
contrary to most of the start @-@ ups , it can float , and therefore has big advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the aer@@ op@@ lane doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . OK .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that per@@ v@@ ade at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be , for example , what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mov@@ able parts that get together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled aircraft that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying works with just one .
this is the mo@@ ver , the simplest tel@@ eph@@ em@@ ised aircraft . it was invented short .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and trans@@ verse ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life happens a lot , so that it can fly stable , and can move anywhere in the room .
but it doesn &apos;t have the elegant algorithm of the rear star@@ ters . to make it fly , I have to throw it right .
the odds of throwing it right when everyone is watching me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the moon is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cou@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is quite symmet@@ rical .
therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in doing so , he receives the extraordinary ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things are possible in models , the rest is learned directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at this .
when flying machines should be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
if something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls out , the electronics or a battery - the machine can continue to fly even if restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration will examine synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercial micro quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for guys like us the reward is in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , clever creatures are allowed to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes were cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far away gal@@ axy . they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of a second in pure energy .
for this brief moment they lit up bri@@ ghtly than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally talk about black holes .
the whole energy was handed over into the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
1.3 billion years ago , a multi @-@ cell life was originated on Earth .
since then , the earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago a group of particularly brave -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most people thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer @-@ gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ shaft @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
so now you call it Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes drift through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of My Dau@@ ghter
and the farewell to my termin@@ ally ill father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of black holes for 23 years and their through observ@@ atories , like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and squee@@ zed into the other .
lec@@ turers often perform a properly sil@@ ly dance in courses on theory of rel@@ ativity .
&quot; stretching , stretching , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ ashed at the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
this means 20 zer@@ os according to the comm@@ a , followed by 1 . this is why the lig@@ o staff declared crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured on less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucle@@ us . that is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are huge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength far smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
sounds are different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually , impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
about the face of your child .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now there is Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; du@@ mmer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot create simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , chir@@ ping simply : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies rotate very quickly , one hears the same circle with an additional key change . this sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement wor@@ m@@ wood , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- heard this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate approximately as fast as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what that means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , cir@@ cling each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we &apos;ve heard it .
there is the permanent importance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to explore the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we cannot see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we learned a lot about space from them .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through since these are opa@@ que .
gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optimistic that there are all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that cause black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the bones of the bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on what happened in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than to listen to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , I would say to all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say yes .
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , but yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of was removing my fear .
my fear of talking , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , called all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you invite me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very proud .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , on our family .
but it also has a start@@ ling side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; say to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am a writer . I think things out , wake you up to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I created television . I produce television .
I do television , in a grand style .
in this TV season , I am responsible for bringing 70 hours of program out into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows simultaneously are in production .
every consi@@ gn@@ ment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days , four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three shows simultaneously : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 Hour TV ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday night .
throughout the world , my series runs in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programmes that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires , all around the world .
do you know who else is doing this ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drops . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you are now running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work , so that you understand that I am not just sitting around the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it is true when I say : I understand that it is not dre@@ aming with a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I go into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I stopped troops , as if I painted on a canvas .
as a result of a high tone , you run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could go on it forever .
many people assume that when I explain to them the bu@@ zz that I am persu@@ aded to write that writing gives me pleasure .
don &apos;t get me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I started with television production when I began working and working and working , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
the sums are more than writing .
the h@@ um is action and activity . the bu@@ zz@@ ing is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a h@@ um , then you can &apos;t strive other than size .
the feeling of being unable to be different than striving for size no matter what price .
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is genius .
maybe it &apos;s called ego .
perhaps it &apos;s the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the bu@@ zz .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more I watch , the more I write history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming , the sum@@ ming .
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz@@ ing . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out .
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ ch , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ ming ceased .
the engine bu@@ zz@@ led .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours of work , worked out weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a Titan is not asleep , does not give up , with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was still@@ ness .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a pre @-@ show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you &apos;re doing it , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing , being a teacher , being a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you knew the bu@@ zz , when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stops , who &apos;s it then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anyone any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did that happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and feel my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read very dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it &apos;s outstanding because my pain and panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl is releasing in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
everywhere peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that &apos;s not right , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing comes back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium frame , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are when I tell you who I am when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the h@@ um is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the Sum@@ ma is the stream that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real sum@@ ming ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a fixed rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice , as long as I want to hear the bu@@ zz@@ ing again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not enough to me how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to be rather than to be home ?
well , I .
honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is not one of them .
we drive around in the garden , in front of and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst into bubbles .
I feel mainly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ ality of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing with the game ?
you can also do it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you think me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie replaces me .
and talking to my teen@@ ie daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year .
it &apos;s just 15 minutes , you don &apos;t need more .
everyone can spend 15 minutes at the play , even on a bad mood !
15 minutes a day !
no mobile , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and keep it out .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I reti@@ re and I &apos;m winning . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in education when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not treat yourself full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the hum@@ ming seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the bu@@ zz but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that &apos;s my bu@@ zz .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the tot@@ ality of work is part of me , but only part of it . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s up to me that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem is playing .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the luck@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I create , the marathon which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the tot@@ ality of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new feeling of being alive within me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
that belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low self @-@ healing ability .
after severe injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; they implant an electro@@ de deep in the brain in order to influence neur@@ ons &quot; circu@@ it@@ ry in such a way that neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain is sw@@ inging to the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , it is necessary to reduce the internal pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to use Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyse brain mass .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue section is comparable to very small children taken out of your families .
you have to find the right food , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw this under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very fast .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were different .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved otherwise .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ell@@ ar bark cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the embry@@ onic stage , they provide for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so certain .
one thing , however , is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain mass from non @-@ linguistic areas and then cultivate the cells exactly how it did Jean @-@ François .
and then mark them in colour in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we reim@@ ported them at the establishment of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- auto transplantation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ plant@@ ate these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ plant@@ ate the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ sig@@ ler , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario , we reim@@ ported the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario , we added a violation and reim@@ plant@@ ated the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ planted .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells we made in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from brain les@@ ions ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
when they had reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor @-@ motor @-@ area in the motor @-@ cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it happened in humans , they spontaneously recovered to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ sed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery , we implant his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey who picked up spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ ported the cells : the same ape , two months after the plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
Bruno . Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the greatest hind@@ ran@@ ces are before you can start clinical studies on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill around two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone reaches the hospital , and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then we have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
after that it is necessary to apply it to a multic@@ enter study .
first , it is necessary to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and for telling us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to regard them as imm@@ utable things .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
democracy really van@@ ishes here , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably made clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections - could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to re@@ think that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group have er@@ red , we could save the democracy , but that we need a genuine and for@@ ceful democracy .
for without democracy our societies are m@@ owed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the topic of waste , I would like to inform you of an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin @-@ summit @-@ Par@@ ad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unt@@ apped cash , which is one of the weal@@ thier savers and corporations , but they are too anxious to invest it where it would be productive and contribute income with which to produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity needs , for example , &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , the United States , England and the euro zone have spent 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lions of US dollars invested in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rail , equipment and so on and so forth .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion sounds like a lot of money until we compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
debts and un@@ productive capital thus form the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest .
un@@ intentionally causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely lav@@ ish art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are crucial to saving the Earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy included too many of course --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the value of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor and gave them not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal temper@@ ing in questions of the state che@@ ek .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not lasted for a long time --
like a candle , which lights up very bright , it is also quickly burned out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for liberal democracy only came when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was narrow@@ ed to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- was a democracy @-@ free zone .
in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two takes place by gradually under@@ mining politics and dis@@ em@@ power@@ ing them .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as in the past ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because you can be in the government these days and still not in power because the power has mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of predat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they feed on , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has can@@ ni@@ vor@@ ed politics so far that it is itself har@@ med by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher will the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if this is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite politicians and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; retain control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by automation and robots .
the problem is that so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks become higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , just like it -- already very soon , as I believe -- to come in countries like China .
so we need to re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ se the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical gains that it has produced .
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; society in which machines serve people and people indulge their energy into the exploration of the universe , or to indulge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long conversations with the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in the practical implementation I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of companies : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while working and in which your capital will follow you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues originate from capital and rede@@ em@@ ing and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those belonging to the enterprises , but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but they do not belong to them . no more pi@@ v@@ ying between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly note that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and any government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trading surplus of each country into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund is invested in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today , in particular , we have them , especially against the background of a re @-@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time the Liber@@ al , in which they preferred privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
are we w@@ aking up in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Lun@@ etti : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something of what I just said is relevant , Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers is called &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am perfectly wir@@ y .
BG : actually , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t mess , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my presentation , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , when I dare say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
to present China now , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experience as Greece &apos;s finance ministers early this year .
Y@@ V : I gu@@ essed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing as we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely to say good @-@ bye to us , and the permanent denial that a massive fault line passed through the euro@@ zone and continues , which threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union massi@@ vely . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the Eurozone , within the European group , have continued to have elected denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union .
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not survive by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you might delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ est juice ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , says he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the contribut@@ ors to finding a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions caused by the euro@@ zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been performing a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika who imposed this policy on us conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be even pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not only have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the world &apos;s strongest economy .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most of them have never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is Senior Manager at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought branch .
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this bend .
this curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows this review will receive .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after you have looked a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he gets more thoughts about the average finish , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is doing something like that , that &apos;s why Roy Price wants nothing to risk .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and by analyzing eight candidates for TV shows , he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch it for free .
and if Amazon prints things for nothing , is it really up to you to do it right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when to start the show , when you pause , what parts you skip or watch again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the true sense of the word -- because the average of this turn is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so something above the average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked on .
about the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team have watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the ratings they give to shows their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , what producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a carriage and decided not to make a Sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data @-@ signed companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work in everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work that way , then this is a bit terri@@ fying because we live in a time when we go more and more into statistics to make serious choices , far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one ever comes into contact with this software in this room . come in contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the US and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is made or not .
just like with Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it &apos;s decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst way through data analysis -- through data analysis of the Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ minated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year around year , until suddenly it stopped working ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the journal Nature .
even the data of sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data stream rapidly into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement of legislation , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics - an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious choices , such as deciding on cancer therapy
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions using data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , do mainly two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a second , you put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intel@@ lect wherever they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what else they would not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is what the data tell us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things are going wrong when data starts to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to not forget this , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will contest it later with a demo of technology .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you of course know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
so maybe the ball is smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what you are doing and take risks .
because in the end , it &apos;s not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
