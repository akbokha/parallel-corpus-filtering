Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
gar@@ den@@ ers farm the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it gets annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , because the car @-@ sat showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are far from actual - but especially insi@@ ghtful .
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Münchner Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that is not recognized as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; documentary sheets &quot; were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities .
these were produced according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops were finally withdrawn with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 : these were the present neighbors who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bayern Map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Palace of Sur@@ veying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the data sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is , like all others , found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison between early and today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was 21 years after the creation of the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first sight : when zo@@ oming into it appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording , &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; little par@@ c@@ els now occupy no more farmers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the October festival in 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow - and not a concrete desert in the 19th century .
on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the data sheet , in the area of the current district of Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the Gast@@ eig &quot; or from the hill &quot; On the Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich district &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren@@ modell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the chain of cigar@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
for 280 patients was first place , later on was extended to 500 places .
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ ro @-@ pension in Haar , 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s biggest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been located there since 2006 .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now meeting on the premises of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , where young people meet at the Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um in Munich .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .
the TS@@ V Munich East soccer field is located to the west , east of residential buildings in the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - an architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ berg , which was destroyed during the Second World War when bombing ra@@ ids . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombing of the Al@@ lied forces broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a great one remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ enhof , where these days will be the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ line .
with the sli@@ ders the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
citizens rights group publishes Travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Pro@@ mot@@ ing of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to discri@@ min@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is expected to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , is calling for special attention to Af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to take special attention when traveling through the state and be noted , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ ci@@ ally @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and will be noted here , &quot; says the group .
a recently passed Bill of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to acc@@ use discrimination complaints , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities that are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minority groups , prompted the group to release the travel warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group quoted incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ enses against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in du@@ bi@@ ous circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of crime .
the Council also points out a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General in which it is shown that black mot@@ orists are raised 75 percent more often than wh@@ ites in the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring in deposit money or know relatives that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report program which classi@@ fies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th R@@ ank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company for housing or employment discrimination .
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which will contribute to further race profil@@ ing in the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States .
the electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ de@@ cca project is a successful project and will be continued next year .
the CD@@ U Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac got a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ Association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the right @-@ gra@@ yed courtyard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
at first Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann provides insights into his farm , where he farms 55 hectares of law@@ ns and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and is accommod@@ ated in five apartments holiday guests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este only regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also Chairman of the B@@ L@@ H@@ V chair of Fis@@ her@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably manage on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area provides a lot of work , much must be handled with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental plant and crops this without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not conduct bio@@ operation .
for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leaders . &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the areas could be dra@@ gged out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013 .
the area of conservation area amounts to 40 hectares , which are not allowed to be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half was promoted by Leader , one quarter bore the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12,@@ 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres of pasture fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ lady you don &apos;t go . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Peter Weiss also stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Refu@@ ge@@ es Directive ( L@@ PR ) in Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state @-@ run grant of Wei@@ de@@ bar@@ ns .
the aim is the openness of the Black Forest .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
in addition , the area to be fenced can not be smu@@ g@@ gled ( inclin@@ ation above 35 per cent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which want to be built just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Fischer@@ bacher Wei@@ f@@ launches project in 2018 .
the area of maintenance is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the sur@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged c@@ amber of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s proposals on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty identi@@ fiers would have ali@@ ghted him if he had done it .
but he took on its significance , and in particular the significance accor@@ ded to it , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , which was added to its base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta cli@@ cked , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ill@@ um@@ ines the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is really right , but as he put it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary resonance of Laz@@ arus , the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich shores . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ event@@ h garbage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who started to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they executed a highly political action .
the sculpture was to show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic portra@@ yal .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and they themselves have a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atives that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
it is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
quite unusual Lim@@ bau@@ gh stum@@ bled on something here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the viewpoint of perception .
Laz@@ arus &apos;s great imagin@@ ative act was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .
in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
the statue of Jesus speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome which they must hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever like to acknowledge .
her torch shall not light the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is the only source of power .
Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ oses Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cing about a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Power Director of the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship leader &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Scotland there is something special &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK have to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think there is something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think there is something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les at their fifth world championships , says it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the medium @-@ sized runner Mu@@ ir goes on this path and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman who was to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games after a great season .
Do@@ yle is reminis@@ cing about her first world championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman was Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
the team captain says she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of her country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als are involved .
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
as for my speech as captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : don &apos;t mess around a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the burning of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he cli@@ cked in the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans &apos;s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and that is why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union filed it at the beginning of this week .
the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
it has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adher@@ ence to principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of people who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spe@@ aker , A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse , defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke with some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound .
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans &apos;s Catholic faith .
lawyer &apos;s Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented on pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors designated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call others &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one has done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn papers with critical articles and to arrest or arrest prot@@ esters .
but this is exactly what happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official who is critici@@ zed for having insul@@ ted Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , governor Matt Pre@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of papers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous wal@@ tz@@ es hit his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ cio &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zing his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain over@@ powered his ministry , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not sil@@ enced her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
and true leadership is to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field links to the final round before losing against Paul E@@ ales , is associated with the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador on behalf of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that really feels very special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the action on home ground .
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more if you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

fewer lung cancer due to passive smoking
fewer people have died of lung cancer over the past two decades .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases can be attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Head of Education Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject of 1994 .
at that time there were still 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger Street is in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Fred Hein@@ ze building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
the traffic , which often hin@@ ders construction work , is a big problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp of St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of drivers in front of red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road was locked and only the regular @-@ line buses were entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ st@@ z and Tim Ko@@ st@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in its wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the char@@ red tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed up with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby mar@@ sh .
a bucket in a gut@@ less room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , working late can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the High@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote for a public lifting in front of the occupying forces .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is desolate . the journey involves a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a 5 hour drive by car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated sheets , which were transformed by rust into different yel@@ low@@ ish @-@ brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes too .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ anti@@ cide and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold@@ land .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , there is an estimated 78 billion US dollars worth of wood resources .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Papua people who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port numbered some 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to one single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ ian demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide according to the Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will Change All &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e of 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electric sur@@ charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as incidents occur every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the screws have increased because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is up to 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes as Muslim economic migrants come from the densely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den caf@@ et@@ erias sell roasted chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to stop here .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local ones , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai immig@@ rant who moved to work in the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the indigenous people of Papua ( the women of Papua ) from Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his electoral campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua people have changed little , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we have voted in favour of Jok@@ ow in 2014 , expecting to fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow &apos;s inaugur@@ ation in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a bon@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers took their tone and later returned to four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ s , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
one child , 16 year old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was struck so severely that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial fighter @-@ bows and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance , im@@ itating in circles and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to cast stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers on an internal funk : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; said it in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to TI@@ ME on the veranda of his painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was over@@ crowded and many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who we@@ ars a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ awes@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the news about the kill@@ ings came only the following day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Jak@@ arta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three weeks Jok@@ ow in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he set up an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses started almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta , saying that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , accused of crimes against humanity , demanding more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum in 1999 , said that 11 cases of violations of human rights in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident ) had already been included .
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims met such asser@@ tions with a fi@@ ery un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says that years later he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ omo repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not stop .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police f@@ lowed down on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 year old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have hidden two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called upon the officers to be held accoun@@ table and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a trouble for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green High@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides are from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; securing national sovereignty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; among the people in Papua Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ content .
the amount of rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous peoples of Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and weal@@ thier migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Papua people rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete with their own companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions of reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission to film was given to them .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy @-@ president of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow &apos;s campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s rest@@ less eastern provinces of Papua and West Africa : visa den@@ unci@@ ation and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the Human Rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4th , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the meeting , but would remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people probably won &apos;t vote for Jok@@ ow again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the tribal council .
he wants Jok@@ ow to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educ@@ ating and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua people , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sho@@ oting victims had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of an victim was buried in a terrain just opposite the police and the military station .
they know they will never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ ac@@ cha@@ ep with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire recognizes the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire occurred in one of the world &apos;s highest towers in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that is swept through the sky@@ scra@@ per in just two years , which is sometimes called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( Tor@@ ch Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an occup@@ ant told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) cleared the fire and cooled the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage was caused by the facing , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation .
in Britain the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and facing at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : more Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has gone through his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the Ho @-@ Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single , which was revolutionary for this sport , was not supported by two @-@ thirds of the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five set classics , which are often very long , but also very much appreciated , remain true to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore narrow@@ ly missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member nations did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the application .
not only for the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal had already come to bring the final in a neutral place .
new starting in 2018 are comparatively minor details : in the following year , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the right to host their host rights in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs of the Organ@@ izer , the requirements regarding training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to do less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 of 5 US travelers will carry banned items into the aircraft , find a survey
a flight pas@@ sports survey revealed that more than 20 percent of illeg@@ ally or un@@ intentionally forbidden subjects were gone by at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent that entered the aircraft , while accidentally carrying forbidden blades or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they had been accidentally discovered that they mistakenly supplied fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey carried out more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules .
from the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X were .
the most common items that have been deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent stated to have know@@ ingly borne items with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it asked travelers around the country to find out how many inad@@ vert@@ ently brought smu@@ g@@ gled goods through the airport security and how many would have done it deliberately .
it is no surprise that people who most likely wear smu@@ g@@ gling ware - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - by security , were those who fly the most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often uncertain about which liquids they may take with you or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
for a while people thought that T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .

so far , he has been suggest@@ ing that a part of the customers has already re@@ trac@@ ted their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the increasingly tri@@ ump@@ tuous figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la chief El@@ on Mus@@ k once again revealed another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure in announ@@ cing the latest quarterly balance : that of the cancell@@ ations at the new mass market model 3 .
over the past few months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed over 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , the delivery of which has just begun .
now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits that 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn from the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are only non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1,000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely back .
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age slu@@ gg@@ ish Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
in the past year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be - 500@@ ,000 - one million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
anyone who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization in practice .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if there are major delays , the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EPA chef P@@ ru@@ itt is moving back on reducing emissions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of dela@@ ying the Obama @-@ Er@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rules &quot; &quot; &quot;
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era &apos;s rules to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint lod@@ ged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
this is a deadline which took place on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for bot@@ tom@@ less o@@ zone .
he announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or obstruc@@ ting economic growth . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump County Public Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al on Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ mah &apos;s regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementing a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that his u @-@ turn at o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often kept the deadlines for carrying out , and then waited to be accused of activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who filed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the EPA statement said that eventually P@@ ru@@ itt will use his authority to delay and all other legally available authority to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pressing for a more comprehensive re@@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States , who had accused the EPA of this week , said that the Group intends to uph@@ old the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the revers@@ al of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important benefit for health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ia , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react in the atmosphere to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered for P@@ ru@@ mah &apos;s surprising course changes .
&quot; it &apos;s wor@@ rying how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to turn to environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
celebrating 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ i their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württemberg Day of the Year : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , apart from the former parish church , there was also a glorious courtyard , which belonged to the church or pat@@ ron@@ al law , and not the other way round .
so there were also men there .
as can be seen from the description of the Ober@@ bay@@ ern Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the outskirts of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement core of the village .
old maps from the period around 1600 confirm these historical facts .
the pat@@ ron@@ al law arose from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man , who built a church , furnished and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church .
associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones of the two sh@@ red@@ ded on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be left later in the Second World War in 1942 .
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell parts were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
in 17@@ 96 French troops placed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was expanded and the church was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the tower of the tower still existing today remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cared for by the &quot; Schaff@@ y Rent@@ als &quot; as success@@ ors by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn the Hil@@ arius installation .
as organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , 16th July , to the sixth seren@@ ade to the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the subur@@ b Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 pm .
for the seren@@ ade of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organisers explore the fantastic views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tumours and radio wel@@ ders .
the friends and supporters of Tum@@ bl@@ i feel particularly committed to home care , such as seren@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to test permission of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval , no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette , since at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
within this concentration area , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the elimination of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city .
these zones are intended to prevent &quot; rec@@ ess &quot; of the landscape .
the city of Vier@@ sen had passed a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette just a few days earlier , but the district government in Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a lack of form .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval certificate is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council once again approved the zone of wind in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is where the granting of authorization for the establishment of wind turbines is legally impossible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been entered into the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes it to the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
already last year the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind park near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies in terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Lower Valais and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was mort@@ ally wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car travelled to Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion to the L 3@@ 33 .
city and dealer plan &quot; Home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gewerbe@@ verein und der Stadt@@ verwaltung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to l@@ ure the inhabitants to shopping in the city centre . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for which offers their own city with@@ stands away from the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
in doing so , the action aims not only on residents of the city and the closer region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that draw attention to the action @-@ weekend , says Christian König .
the municipal administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Tag &quot; for the well @-@ being and selling Sunday , talks with all the business@@ men and hosts , in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential is to be re@@ opened or re@@ opened .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to revi@@ ving the city centre - to land@@ lords , the companies of the whole city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly wider , the king said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that , for the first time , five Thür@@ inger cities will participate in the third &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; day , for the first time .
besides Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and increase its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action taking place under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and its many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct surroundings .

tr@@ ump used after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts from phone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January Tr@@ ump asked En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president kno@@ cked him out because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the Wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull was also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull said that trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; dump@@ ing &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump completed the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury went through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer @-@ strip - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the occup@@ ants were in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged by the passenger seat .
luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only one night .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost all of the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 , citizens rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; it &apos;s really incredible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches even though we know who they are , &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a dirty spot in a story , but it &apos;s a burden to our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Con@@ gres@@ sman of Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him the post @-@ ordination serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays down a bed cloth on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected of the ly@@ n@@ ching process .
but no one has ever been indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects remain on the free foot for decades , citizens &quot; rights say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the election campaign in the summer .
about the same time as the election , according to the FBI the black farmers Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , down during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our of the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Dor@@ othy &apos;s wife Mal@@ com@@ s and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to release Mal@@ com from prison , according to FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they got away from prison and drew near the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a ly@@ n@@ ch mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy involving the state and local prosec@@ utions that had not only been involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and obsc@@ uring the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
her representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , po@@ ign@@ ant and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of which want to believe that he does not exist in America any more .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and even more difficult to see away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ n because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness of all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - went into a room and listened as a Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the chief clan member for many years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ by Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who played Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the test@@ ers scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a reci@@ eves the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people were &apos; n &apos; --- &apos; he &apos; said then . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black actors thunder@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship is replacing the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene begins again .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ended violent and fast .
there are cries , shots and then silence .
a woman dressed in mour@@ ning stands above the bodies of the actors and presents Bil@@ lie Holidays g@@ lowing praise of &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity every almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks takes her on a pilgrimage to the grave sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
until this point the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , if you stand in the same country where the ly@@ n@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse .
children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thank@@ ed the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch@@ rope and wipe their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in suits who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a hu@@ gs two of his fellow players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional strain of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience gets together with the actors for dinner .
at one table , a white couple from Atlanta chat@@ ters about the re@@ position with a black pair that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which made him feel the performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that Lyn@@ chen is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone sets Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he eats and re@@ members civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the post @-@ ordination is inspiring in a way , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so , if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wagner generation in Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf hon@@ ors a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with Mauer@@ park and D@@ ön@@ er bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ d &quot; logo from East Germany or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car par@@ ked in which the Rhine @-@ le@@ vers pose as Rock@@ ef@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - which moves through its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three Rhine @-@ daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Hollywood @-@ style , ESS , they kid@@ nap Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ atter a cor@@ pse in the trunk of Hollywood and give the Kra@@ pan@@ o cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the gorgeous nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a wei@@ ght@@ box .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later we have to believe Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are stor@@ m@@ ingly celebrated , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to Merkel &apos;s smo@@ ker .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes .
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to let go of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violin conc@@ erto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 , five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to have rejo@@ iced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown to be an understanding of how it looks .
I put a positive resume .
max amounts to work as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
lot : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I help out here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at the school for an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
lot : it &apos;s a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ time volunteer .
how does that come about ?
amount : I graduated in high school .
and then a civil engineer studies , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled .
I know for myself that it is a wrong for me and I want to do something different to work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there &apos;s an insight , there you can see how it is on the spot , in the focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it like that ?
amount : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study the dual study , probably do a social worker training in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different places of use during the Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ering Service ?
amount : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you do your FS@@ J .
it is possible to make it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partially in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works .
different than in civil engineering studies ?
amount : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating extras .
there are always other people in the head , each having a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee or a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you didn &apos;t have reservations ?
lot : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
much love , much kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is like that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pear@@ son cuts more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve business &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday , they will cut out more 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company faces .
the job cuts , the general director of John Fall@@ on , announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost .
in May in a third cost cutting programme , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in order to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning .
the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ i attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the capital of Afghanistan , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured and NATO signed a declaration .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports three civilians died in the subur@@ b of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h .
the bombing is the last violent act in Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a Nato statement , the explosion on Thursday evening would happen when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital on the flight site B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest military attack of the country since the US @-@ led troops forced the Taliban out of power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to suits
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay governance of the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states accused the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA manager Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in June P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in some part of the country in order to specify where inc@@ isions must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Columbia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations that the former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have spark@@ ed the set@@ back of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
common room wants common room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the council of Flu@@ orn @-@ win@@ ks decided to establish a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the remaining part of the land is signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
although it may take a long time before the church community still belongs to the church , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living area of around 55 square meters and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square metres space for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council are in a position to see such a common room as a meeting place not only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ ent living , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting cafe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the running budget in the past fall is due to funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the rehabilitation area .
according to T@@ j@@ aden , the establishment of a shared space would be capable of boo@@ sting 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposal envis@@ ages , in order to signal the investor that there is no bil@@ let between the legs in this respect , the finding that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as th@@ at@@ ched roof - which reduces the tr@@ uss height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer , be this addition .
if it helps , he passes the body unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings , with which one does not get that right , but now they lean forward to the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; I am very hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is definitely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against municipal participation .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface , there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter@@ value , which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the opposite .
at the request of Sta@@ ig@@ ers to accept the proposal , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it stays with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which Stefan H@@ aller summari@@ zes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a giant leap to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with Car : cyclists are thrown on the road
when crossing the road a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath and severely injured .
as the police informed , the 82 @-@ year old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Straße in direction Hil@@ den had been on the road with his bicycle on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Straße .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver who was driving in the same direction allowed him to take preced@@ ence .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder took up the road , he apparently did not regard the opposite .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ching car .
FC Bayern München has to disp@@ ense with David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries FC Bavaria is travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
the personnel worries of the German football record master Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8 : 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at the Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also abst@@ ain from the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed this on Friday .
the mou@@ ths of Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are also missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six tests , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least it was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the resin from star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the intention of the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andreas Berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes to meet the need for information of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it connects nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and star patterns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
In@@ quiry : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ss and Si@@ eber .
the information on the boards is to be supplemented by internet .
therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the site .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star@@ path Ticket will be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path , the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars had different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ ous than another , even though it is much farther away .
I will also teach in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been running the highest observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg .
the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation .
from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star@@ base - the planet path .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path with its stel@@ ae leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and to the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ aa ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the planet @-@ dropped Plu@@ to at the end@@ point - are set up exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the earth shr@@ inks so on a 6.5 milli@@ metre diameter sphere , while the sun standing exactly 75 meters away measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet &apos;s route is about four kilometers .
while the light is required from Sun to Plu@@ to for about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the plug with Plu@@ to .
thus , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in space .
the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most thrilling boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion Stal@@ lion went down to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super fe@@ ather weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down to light weight .
and he has to move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko began to agree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asks if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interested in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23rd September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all the fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia commented and later expressed himself openly to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he reck@@ oned Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he might take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko said with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he was thinking that the three @-@ match Champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show dr@@ um@@ ming , then boxing .
both said they could sense the momentum created for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that needs to be done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia commented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after tire bur@@ sts
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were seriously injured in the afternoon .
following initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost the control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market at 4.@@ 30 pm just before the end of the market .
the car hur@@ led right into the slope , where he over@@ turned and then lay on the roof of the green strip .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left landing strip could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
after 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that optim@@ ising the defensive formation in Au@@ e points .
Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the first round of the season , with the result that the two ad@@ versaries would not have been against Br@@ uns@@ wick at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ chain should also be further optimized .
and a gate after an off@@ shoot , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch up anymore .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one else is standing next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that even after his experience in preparation with the tri@@ g@@ chain , his team is better able to cope with the chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we are currently on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ aan and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; Hoffmann said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the requirement is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we do not make so many play@@ mistakes in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e , of course , to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ match from a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , if we stand with four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; I judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Fort@@ una &apos;s inner defender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad@@ mitt@@ edly guests from the Rhin@@ eland start as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep it away only because we claim to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish Asyl@@ um Assessment Test published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested individuals are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Medic@@ ines Agency ( Agency for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Board ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
ei@@ ghty per cent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are pretty constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the journal The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases where the person was judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over their age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the results published 5@@ 81 , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .
the medical age assessment method , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they were earlier or later than usually pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is insufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is that if the person is under 18 , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are proceeding well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going to be great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road Traffic and Traffic in the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three renovation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building end is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be kept .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , cla@@ d with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach passed on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
this is a peripheral mounting , which is also used as operating distance .
a 2,@@ 20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is going to run .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges .
special finger@@ tip sensitivity has required laying cables through the structure in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
the local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished at first .
the traffic lanes are regulated by traffic lights for the bridges between the building yard and the collecting point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully locked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole country is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ out protest with German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the county @-@ stag group ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance that shows the flag peac@@ efully this day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle to the &quot; big campaign launch &quot; according to the poster .
and well @-@ known names at the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ Americans but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ei@@ fel is colorful &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the town picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well , but now takes place in the parking space below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great as many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Original potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police ordered many civil servants to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it also shows presence at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ kin reported from the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ ic Ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces available because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pe is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also a band for entertainment at around 8@@ pm , in the Stad@@ thalle there are several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the room waiting for the nomin@@ ee for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to speak their speeches .
the police presence remained unchanged , but until now the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is in the row of Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ konz@@ erte morgen , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchest@@ ras .
this is Pet@@ kov &apos;s solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo sax@@ ophone player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire to not only cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach res@@ oun@@ ds with the two as in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; Welt@@ musik &quot; mixes with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games blend together into a fascinating combined art work .
this core piece of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart speaks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart , openly about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately came out bitter .
in spite of all this , the b@@ rün@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin insured against the Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar magazine : &quot; I was in love with every one I had .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten claimed she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ ders me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show Bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered in school time when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and embarrass@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girls , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to behave in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself to the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces he changes the Party
&quot; &quot; &quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s democratic candidate .
justice , the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal business from his father .
he is worth about $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , the National Republi@@ can National Committee announced on Thursday evening an explanation in which it said : &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather prevent us from working in order to make our country again great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is only the final rejection of a party which is without guidance from top to bottom , and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight against dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been gra@@ bbed gold and silver med@@ als at competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted on the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the cor@@ rupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships on Friday in London following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still inadequate and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told re@@ porters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tragedy for Mali St@@ oned Sol@@ di@@ ers
at a funeral service in Frit@@ z@@ lar , North Hessen , about 1000 people of the two soldiers arrived in Mali under a helicopter crash .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing to the un@@ resolved reason of the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she described the two reverse pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow before this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen died a week ago in Mali on Wednesday .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Saint Peter .
at noon only the members of the Church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , of representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
roses laid down roses , the relatives stood in arms in arms on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the minister of defence of the Le@@ yen called the fallen soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and collap@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann constructed the flight operation of the combat helicopter tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show any doubt about the UN mission in Mali : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
that &apos;s what the Royal House announced on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s Cathedral Church .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the announcement .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title .
following the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also retired the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by declared , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people were always f@@ lown , Prince Hen@@ rik had a serious status in his nearly 50 years of rule in the Dan@@ es .
in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia @-@ Tab@@ ak and who had the reputation of being the brand of socio @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to quickly re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of potential majority in Lower Saxony
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a quick re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign .
because it was Friday for the resolution of parliament .
before that , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Green Party member from their state parliament faction in Lower Saxony has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a difficult crisis .
five months before the official date of the parliamentary elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover thus lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Gre@@ ens @-@ Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover .
the group &apos;s spokes@@ man , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to commend his faction to include them .
thus , the CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , the SPD and the Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the country &apos;s day as quickly as possible decides its self @-@ resolution .
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Land@@ tag draws the confidence of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be examined legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all questions will be discussed in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally checked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ v@@ est &apos;s step , &quot; but something strange . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself pointed out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described himself as a singer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the stub@@ born de@@ pu@@ ties to return to their country &apos;s state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that they will have immediate effect on their landing tags , which they have received through the green country list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the regional leaders Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen extraordinary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have deliberately decided not to speak any pron@@ unci@@ ation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transition of the Lower @-@ Saxon Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only treas@@ on to voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the chief of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to make the Parliament re @-@ elected .
Australia &apos;s exit costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
the politi@@ cian set &quot; in her last vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests before the good of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony is contributing this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nieder@@ sach@@ sen &apos;s CD@@ U president , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .

Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal last ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , is in an interview with Germany &apos;s editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the most up @-@ to @-@ date information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we know right now , a health risk is practically impossible .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless my house has switched off immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s sad@@ ness .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
the trade , as well as the manufacturers , have to ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ proof and harmless to health .
if the residual oil content of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded in eggs , these are not capable of traffic .
un@@ polluted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , the companies are not to blame .
are production companies and consumers in the same boat ?
according to current knowledge , production plants are not directly responsible .
rather , they must reck@@ on with economic damage as a result of presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too few controllers in serious cases .
is it missing only at the staff or on the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process .
however , the truth is also that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent .
it is precisely because of this that a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the authorities in the cases where criminal off@@ ences can be met is of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ enabled foods . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly judged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result of the company , manufacturers , retailers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals cannot be tolerated and must be terminated immediately .
at all levels , this must be done consistently and with high pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and comprehen@@ sively elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how the football rules of football impact on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded spending of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will still come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the wealthy ruling family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to counter with legitimate sources of income which allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea in 2003 bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er affair .
during the current financial period of the FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini fell out of favour by the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to frigh@@ ten himself from excessive issues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the Buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros can be reported in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , hit the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies tied to the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be deemed to be legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Q@@ at@@ ari 2022 denied that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G about N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .
they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not entitled to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be posted .
PS@@ G expects that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival is a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales after the signature will rise by at least 30 percent .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by saying that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because there are different ways or different interests can have if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new store supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Board Cho@@ colate has produced chocolate for Swiss Life .
now the close cooperation is at the end of a possible end : the airline will re @-@ write the contract .
Swiss @-@ speaking entrepreneur Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on Friday .
according to current plans , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million tiny red and white packaged sho@@ ot@@ ings distribute to 14 grams each year before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to make any statements about the cost .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ der estimates the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves annual sales of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
as many applicants do with the new tender , Swiss will not want to give away .
but only Swiss producers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement .
Swiss have been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights since 2006 .
before signing a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut provided the chocolate tablet in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of co @-@ operation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the First Class customers are spo@@ ilt by the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class nas@@ chen passengers scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as a fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; func@@ tioned surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for an appealing cub@@ icle that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the day - actors middle @-@ aged play hor@@ ny children , who will grow - they still managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes beyond the casting principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &quot; s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That The cra@@ dle is shaking &quot; ) .
at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a novel@@ ist , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) still hasn &apos;t lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy malicious plot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s whis@@ kers from singles , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random del@@ u@@ sions that could fuel this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east vs west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled vor Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingenious idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice bags for watching ( the police sp@@ ends time watching chess on TV , as Americans may do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &quot; Fin@@ ds the voice out &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; gets involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who we@@ ars a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
with six long episodes , it draws away , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; re@@ arranged to a lesser extent , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make it all for for@@ age .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian writers were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact on drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in beating the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as Kon@@ stanz public prosec@@ utor announced on Friday .
15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years ago and arrest warran@@ ts were already issued against them .
officials also ensured larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are presumably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the campaign .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , severe violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office Con@@ stance has been investigating the organised drug trade in Southern Germany since summer 2016 .
between the State Department in Con@@ stance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the big effort was accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo .
in particular , Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia came into sight .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go into the account of the gang .
Weise lam@@ ents big gaps in the for@@ eigner tab
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreign registry in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this lead to some serious wrong decisions on asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er responsible for the refugee management of the federal government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the foreign country register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there could lead to some serious wrong decisions in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are listed in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been adequately cared for , the quality of data has not been good in parts so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data inputs can significantly slow reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in the statistics on a sufficient number of people , EU citizens are also registered , who would not have to travel at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false arrangements led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with adequate &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the federal government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have entered from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this comes from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , &quot; BA@@ MF is leading such proceedings &quot; concerning families with children , with the exception of infants and infants , to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , it was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU @-@ state &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refugees &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are responsible for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the country of entry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with children under age in Italy has considerably increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for the recording and accommodation of families . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten human rights conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ eg@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his 100 donations now donated 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges several times the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it &apos;s awesome as our body is laid out for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ators who make their blood available to strangers , &quot; under@@ lined by mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the c@@ anned foods are de@@ composed into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported from the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ eg@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K district leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously the change in the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were among the multi @-@ don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 blood donations .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter leave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their li@@ fes@@ pan .
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation on an increase .
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members in favour of an increase in this month as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly GDP forecast , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % for 2017 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to almost 3 % in the fall .
but she sign@@ alled that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected on the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mut stimulus package issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial funds for banks from the coming February , although it has been said that now it is expected to provide $ 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the decision on the interest rate , the bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at interest rates , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be necessary to cooling inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than markets are expecting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this year and next year are forecast for 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared with the forecast forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound after these messages fell vis @-@ à @-@ vis the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change will come after the latest dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened rising expectations on a rise in interest rates and GDP grew by 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to fall by 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year .
the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for budgets that will be affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening will be even worse before it will improve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the return of income , but added that wages are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will offset a portion of the lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote that caused the fall of the pounds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for a rise in interest had risen , as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and that it will be put on again in the coming months .
the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; entirely &quot; attributed to the weak Po@@ und .
Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ink , director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages take out and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment after a fight in front of the High Court against the funding of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ pre@@ posi@@ tional pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the Ministry of Health over a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d are among the first to enable registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ p pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a sequence of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p has significantly reduced HIV transmission in infectious disease .
pre@@ p before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come into question for the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants identify those who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be reviewed by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered by a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , how it is used and implemented on a large scale .
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , aimed specifically at needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to a transaction with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said CEO of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcomed and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that they will contribute to the ending of the dis@@ sem@@ ination of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer plo@@ ys have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , moved to an Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger space with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something similar to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that was my requirement , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 ft high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama .
the mezzanine looks down a classic copper sky@@ light from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre , space and light .
on both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , sealed units can accommodate all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
by the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ wei@@ ghty so that when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor area - or how your property will be appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor space and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love electrical sockets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and raised square meter of something by default in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide to not leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million dollar property empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Victoria in the value of more than 500 million dollars .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estates in value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold to USD 85 million in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De LU@@ TI@@ S now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler apartments as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - described by Paul as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court records states that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I held for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to in@@ compet@@ ently manage some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote .
the costs rise in the event of hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter Che@@ que Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties .
Mrs. De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im shop of the family .
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna de LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often told me he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , whereas Col@@ in claims that when leaving the company , Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , Paul says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very reluct@@ ant even though he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from the year 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case was in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e myself and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a steady course .
here &apos;s a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that has fallen into the hands of the President .
Kelly told the people that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by controlling his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television is decades back - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping the Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . OK .
but the idea that tr@@ umps Twitter habit has ever been &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
maybe these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that tr@@ umps twe@@ ets should contain more combus@@ tible material without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his co @-@ workers managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts were worth it .
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversi@@ es .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that possibly promotes their views from the world .
in May , PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - fully engaged in this story - reported on the preference of the advis@@ ers to give the President for strategic reasons doub@@ t@@ ful information .
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with sham@@ eful ch@@ equ@@ es , and that he insi@@ sts on finding out where they come from .
this is exactly what happened in the end of February when someone intentionally mali@@ ci@@ ously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Got@@ tsch@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused K@@ atie Wal@@ sh &apos;s deputy chief of staff to be &quot; the source behind a pile of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ anes , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors still strive for influence .
these un@@ changeable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get Post from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped .
the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
since the addresses of the sought after s@@ words are naturally not known , references from the population will be hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting destinations hide at holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
21 Post@@ cards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled .
since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted , which has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requests could be arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to notices after publication on the website .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est land@@ lords of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some resol@@ ute travellers on the war@@ foot that have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn by the community to demand a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do Soli@@ hull road called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after being thrown out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath where they threw stones on their pass@@ ers @-@ by .
the Council must be forced into action by Sch@@ am , as he was useless in dealing with the problem .
the travellers were there in May , were moved and are now back again .
more arrived yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by holding long instructions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my municipal fee if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a resident who didn &apos;t want to be named said , &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of those travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the numbers have increased and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ supported camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by invo@@ king 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof due to the former ambi@@ ance operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13th , 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the tourist tax .
in the fall of 2014 , the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees arriving in the county , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council .
but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people in the house at that time .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els , Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt @-@ building .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof , construction sh@@ utt@@ ings have been standing in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is carried out .
the floors were pulled out , blankets were broken down , old bath tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to be done by March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on , as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and meeting room belong to the facilities .
one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale inner city level , Sch@@ erer is emphas@@ ised .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
both individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already had talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the performances of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
when the investment is high , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly what he is looking for .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outside facilities are also brought to the front man , which is already clearly visible .
in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .

in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
the panel resum@@ ed work in recent weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal entitled to people familiar with the matter .
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reported that there are already the first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a longer period of time to intervene in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump@@ et campaign team and Moscow .
the investig@@ ators focus on several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more tr@@ umps in his private and business environment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special investig@@ ator Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to examine the evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether to raise charges .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also referred to as prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
they are usually turned on when it comes to bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office in order to invite persons for hearing under oath .
according to the CN@@ N broad@@ caster , invitations were issued that revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who participated in the meeting had been asked for a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump couns@@ ellor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his presidential candidate Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also participated in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the exposure show that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up in the end to decide on the charging of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats a possibility to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but this work usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House endor@@ ses any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the Special Agent in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that I would not be as@@ cer@@ tained by the President .
one has no reason to assume that something has changed in it , it called on in the explanation .
Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this ran@@ ch , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump have been loud , he has hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a sen@@ ate committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a setting up of investigations against the then national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special educ@@ ator and its employees .
this triggered speculation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to be released .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the president &apos;s margins from the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented the bill on Thursday that the special investig@@ ator could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : giant ic@@ e@@ berg dri@@ fts in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in western Antar@@ c@@ tica a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg lo@@ osed from the close seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ ith .
the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , which has a tri@@ l@@ lion ton@@ ne , now dri@@ fts north and will take two or three years until it melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant glaci@@ ers that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
according to research data , the extent to which climate change played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear .
but in total there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for around 30 years , the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) writes in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now broken Kol@@ oss was a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ith .
ice shelf flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ith lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e the balance of growth and abor@@ tion was disturbed a few years ago .
A@@ WI researcher , Daniela Jan@@ sen , writes a complete ice shelf there .
there are a lot of things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e is in danger , because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is currently .
in addition , the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point .
the melting of ice shelf and ic@@ eber@@ gs does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI statistics , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the wi@@ dest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C ice shelf will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers did not return to the destruction of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many of the polar regions of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades .
this long skirt of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends to South America .
according to the data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the last 50 years , making it one of the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate at the staff
because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to withdraw from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , 41 new jobs were dri@@ lled in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 trainees have left their first working day .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously very much sought after .
there were about 6@@ 20 applications for the places to be awarded this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently there are still 50 vac@@ ant jobs in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general management forces .
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the desire of the parties , the administration should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet the short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented care@@ ers of applicants .
the overall concept should focus internally and extern@@ ally , highlight concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , require CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circuit has to deal with personnel problems you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is about a real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this involves a high number of employees who leave the service in an age @-@ related or age @-@ related manner .
it is high time for action so that no more jobs are left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party .
he was already in the circle day for a big surprise when he questioned the personnel costs and the rest of the parties stun@@ ned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be examined , which allow ex@@ iting from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if we do not find a satisfactory solution here at short notice , the district administration with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should seek a ho@@ ur@@ ly tari@@ ff , &quot; says peoples .
in doing so , the CD@@ U is trying to pay more attention to the employees and officials as it actually fores@@ ees the public service charges .
the sal@@ aries are prescribed right now , increases or more money is only available when switching to a higher level , which orient@@ ates itself in professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned that NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Home Secretary Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis &apos;s warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; because their team worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; for us , the saving of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all the accus@@ ations that are currently being raised after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boat , I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that its crew takes rubber din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are delivered to them by human traders , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue missions have so far been prepared to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organisation is Mé@@ dec@@ s without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Minn@@ iti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mers Bi@@ ker , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berliner out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome bonus .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view@@ points followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream plains .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once more , the look@@ out was on the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wer@@ age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and in@@ let huts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed cur@@ ative br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres in altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - spor@@ tily and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga push@@ es for E @-@ Sport
do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium racing at wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included .
this has also recognised the first Federal Law Gaz@@ ette , which is increasingly involved in this field .
at the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports division in mid @-@ July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is sure that some clubs are still going on this train . &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers from different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in E @-@ sport .
the former trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that the young people will go to the stadium even in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with celeb@@ r@@ ity e @-@ athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the national league to Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA will be cont@@ ested at the competition level .
as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other .
and for the Asian Games , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ us has long been dealing with the question .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
furthermore , there are cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability .
professional gam@@ ers should train not only on the console but also their body and watch out for nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport failed .
the scientist emphasizes the high integrity of the E @-@ sport .
players are on the move on an international level , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers .
a study by the Corporate Executive Consul@@ t@@ ancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and major tournaments .
in three years sales are expected to be around 130 million .
against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
however , e @-@ sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants write .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internationally , many countries are already on the move . &quot; &quot; &quot;
major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport competition provider Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school e @-@ sport was introduced as a lesson , says F@@ rob@@ inia .
in the Netherlands and France , the football league clubs according to D@@ utt are meanwhile committed to setting up an e @-@ sports section .
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger mann .
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is not enough today .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company on the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that only in football everything remains as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter condem@@ ns Con@@ rad Roy for the lyrics , condem@@ ning Con@@ rad Roy
a Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to commit suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent assass@@ ination of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is dis@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from a psychological illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when she was condemned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life in order to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has shown no regret . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she depl@@ ores . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even her mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day when I don &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all my pain that we will bear for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person with whom I have been together since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy had died of a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a car in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , jump out of a building , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several news that she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All you need to do is switch on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told Car@@ ter &apos;s attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit by any press of the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
one of the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ uns : learning from the new mini @-@ Lah@@ my of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain in the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern won a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - there is no extra motivation for extra motivation .
something else was different on his place in the cabin , which Joshua k@@ im@@ me immediately saw , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ my and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the rush tightly joined to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavaria &apos;s Captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i could interpret the sign from the coach as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ el@@ f , which had just arrived from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just from the holiday , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those of you who want to get a lot of herbs that you want to keep in your mood .
so those who have been chosen to compete against lam@@ bs can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ i confirmed , &quot; That &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fli@@ ck@@ ering as a mini @-@ lam@@ ine over the field .
to the right , that &apos;s his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did the rest .
and at all k@@ im@@ me worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the rod also best into his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ coordinated trou@@ pe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were occupied with himself .
V@@ idal &apos;s ability to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , to tie him out of the services of the Asia trip ( also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus not to be neg@@ atively affected in their first appearance in the Bayern tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran along with Kim@@ che , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times successfully in the construction of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a good performance at the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shifting , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also taken for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked after the game afterwards .
for example , in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two interviews , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ i retired after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on his new fellow player &apos;s back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new .
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
David Al@@ aba joins the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s best @-@ known foot@@ b@@ aller has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and liked the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire is practically the club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Sch@@ na@@ der@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our ladies .
the twe@@ ets of the Austrian football team of the year and champi@@ ons League winners should be a special motivation sy@@ ringe .
the famous Bavaria @-@ Dus@@ el might well need our ladies .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises Sen@@ dres@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still an economic minister of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is demonstrated after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on behalf of T V on a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minist@@ erial pri@@ es@@ thood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has all blocked &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the major turn@@ around looks natural in infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
this year the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 will be the building law .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West Bank of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Highway Plan .
the aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , &quot; says Minist@@ eri@@ ums@@ y Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive firms .
the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) , as by Wis@@ sing , aims to produce a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label on wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports falling for ten years .
in addition , the I@@ HK has an open ear for people who want to start their own company .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier gives an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is fores@@ een for the passed Master &apos;s exam and 2500 Euros if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
with the planned road construction , facts are fast to create , at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Managing Director of the Trier University of Industry .
so far only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to adjust the knowledge of state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , points to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros less in receipt of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
furthermore , Frank nat@@ us is expecting a concept of the country as to how it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country is also sober@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a score of 3.4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ downs .
on the other hand , former economic minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Gre@@ ens group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months , they already cleared the field because of discre@@ pan@@ cies .
Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW claimed that it would be able to update the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the leader of the BMW Group said that &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving constraints , &quot; referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but nitrogen oxi@@ des em@@ itting diesel engines are considered carcin@@ ogen@@ ic and can cause asthma .
the cost of autom@@ akers to install equipment for neutr@@ alization of exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , making it difficult to maintain the price of cars competi@@ tively .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of plot@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted and others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in Audi &apos;s engine development was arrested in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent emissions legislation in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could pose a serious burden to Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes more than proportion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s win .
this message has the raft on the Is@@ ar on Saturday
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich tomorrow , which has a special message .
if on Saturday you go back to the Is@@ ar , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ b@@ ach@@ brücke .
and this is not a usual raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building office wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large neur@@ otran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a Müll@@ berg .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a worthy game of game is to be sharpen@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
already last summer , the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los C@@ ole n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
in times , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most published cartoon characters , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademarks .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an also records and works on a film with 85 .
his message : laughter , &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he en@@ visi@@ oned among other things as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for congrat@@ ulation cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he once said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , he made a breakthrough at the end of the six@@ ties : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures ca@@ vor@@ t in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits at the drawing table , works daily for almost ten hours .
via cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , its cute figures continue to find much spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon film and TV series for six years with his figures .
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - the most popular animal in his drawings - that has a jack @-@ of @-@ thousands as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is supposed to come onto the cinema screen in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that &apos;s why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced word@@ lessly .
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of d@@ rought and insect @-@ borne insects , which causes researchers and farmers trying to find solutions , causing great headache .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively at risk , because in recent years the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall .
this has an effect on the life of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is a lot of stake in the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evap@@ oration of evap@@ oration from soil , but also spra@@ ying plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resili@@ ent to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary this year .
festival point is this Saturday and Sunday with a middle age fest .
dealers , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ inas or a land camp should be able to experience these days in the city centre .
the murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly paper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings range .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay list or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the cor@@ p@@ ses pile up all over the country , more and more journalists are involved : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year .
among the latter is her editor and her inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear T @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney Office was set up in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders involved in drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ separ@@ able and even though the terrain is still tre@@ ach@@ erous .
without any information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why we all mi@@ str@@ ust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he just managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the &quot; 12th river . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions fight here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes to the United States .
nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival anti@@ trust fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to news@@ letters .
the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez to leave the country for his own security after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
in 2003 , he worked as an experienced journalist for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined five colleagues in the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US @-@ dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to pursue journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and revenue and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved it to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it was leading .
he volunte@@ ered to be sc@@ ared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you think as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not tell what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office and always sit on the same table there .
now they ask : was his love for the routine his destruction ?
she also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it if you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells false , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anno@@ y@@ ance is , the editor of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is constantly changing .
days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen tried protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police , whom the Gover@@ nor himself referred to as un@@ trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the re@@ porters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto in control .
for this week &apos;s edition , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has written three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of former well @-@ known driver Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to state expendi@@ tures focused on the home town of the Gover@@ nor .
and there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Public Prosecutor , conducted a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was charged when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ma@@ stered all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this loc@@ ale , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man kidn@@ apped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have regarded the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about ab@@ duction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected themselves : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .
in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by writing down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press , &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez inc@@ la@@ ims the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials and an equivalent company .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces , who put them under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Cart@@ el : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones sat beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of their director in 2004 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for haz@@ ards .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue work , it &apos;s a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug trade deter@@ red him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on last Friday , when the last issue was already over , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when suddenly all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to hum@@ p .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with ri@@ vals and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated , as promised by a number of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone .
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens are nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were willing .
if they were afraid at all , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When the same day Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to sof@@ ten their enemies
at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
now researchers have discovered that the first findings of the incredible n@@ ash@@ ore of a Canadian min@@ er have been so well preserved that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs &quot; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they had something of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ kept arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that was out of place by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy Earth &apos;s l@@ ump .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into history as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ r &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have discovered that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with a be@@ et and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter@@ f@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed him to get better acquainted with his surroundings and to ev@@ ade his enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli after the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the surprising preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its under@@ side .
although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution encouraged the conce@@ al@@ ment of the confrontation as a means of survival .
but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ les - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been the cra@@ yon time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including its preserv@@ ative agent , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on his back to the se@@ abed .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served sc@@ aly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just glan@@ cing a little with your eyes , you might almost believe he &apos;s asleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when gigantic ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ ious ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the trade journal Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best @-@ kept arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 inch long spi@@ kes that prot@@ ru@@ ded from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the arm@@ oured plant e@@ ater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater re@@ mission of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ tery .
the more I make it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
severe accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , miles @-@ long jams - and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich motorway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the first statements of the police there were about 30 vehicles between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks .
by the exact number of the injured , there are no indications at first .
a police spokesperson said that it was light to moderate injuries .
a large range of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of travel in Munich , a distance of about ten kilometres was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it also came on the opposite course to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the number plates of the vehicle hand@@ le@@ vers who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pun@@ ishments .
shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing remin@@ ders you to sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened into his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes one uns@@ an@@ ft or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the most up @-@ to @-@ date ticket control .
you simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and vali@@ date your ticket .
currently , a test operation is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the offer comes , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the railway ticket de@@ valuation with no conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and one must have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
it is also important to have purchased the DB Navig@@ ator app , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation then appears in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
if the train driver arrives at number Y at the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
the &quot; check in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers .
&quot; if you want to travel without ticket control through our train atten@@ dant , you simply check out the DB Navig@@ ator yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB &apos;s marketing executive vice @-@ president . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because of@@ ten@@ times one has , in any case , one of the co @-@ travellers not all the documents that one needs for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing .
the result is endless discussions between driver and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this can only be done at the connections of ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further gn@@ um@@ bers on the same track are not yet enabled .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ the@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was continually saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was involved in twe@@ eting the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put off her mobile phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photographs of the police band and people scre@@ aming , and of a man who claimed to be a father &apos;s father holding a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed with a polic@@ eman standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman assured his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from November 11 .
it is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resili@@ ence , which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , drove to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the black experience and the black condition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; countless times this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take it with me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know it and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do in order to be free to free ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the Police Department , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosec@@ utor of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there , Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped them pass them on to prot@@ esters .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism totally changed after August 9 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , stating that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis the President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one question came from Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt inhabitants .
his involvement has brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team followed in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; said Davis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I will be portrayed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result documents of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , which after the murder of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ jack Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is held up by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person t@@ apping this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not by chance , even though it was at the forefront , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can sense their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory , since she went on the street in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers will discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves the people , although it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping mall on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
the theme can hardly be cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one went to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Show@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers , the rest of which will benefit from the other shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , where 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a Square with the possibility to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the countryside ladies always like to be very happy .
we also discovered the but@@ cher shop for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether there is a direct market in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rent depends on the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the new project should probably not be very low . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what &apos;s the purpose of shopping in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find this superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of this in our city .
one can see how many shop shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but as there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved .
after all , the goods offered there is fresh , is offered mostly directly from the producer and is also inexpensive .
as you can see , shop shops are only hired by larger companies in a shopping mall , as the rentals there are often un@@ sustainable for a retailer .
too bad , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear again . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a Mark@@ thalle doesn &apos;t suit me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the Pe@@ as@@ ant Mark@@ thalle go during construction time ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually comes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ o@@ sting bit gallery already manage to drive away all shops from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that &apos;s empty .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg give no place for a farmer &apos;s market hall .
once the farmers market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from che@@ eks @-@ t@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the prison Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence , after she public@@ ally opened diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on August 2 is a Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( A fitting simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and a ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and from the 30 portraits were created , like someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also created for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was convic@@ ted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft .
her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated mice became un@@ equal e@@ ye@@ witnesses who , over the course of two years , exchanged several letters .
they even created a comic book illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which the president was to transform judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama would actually demand only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fl@@ aming the rigid divisions he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called with her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is end@@ owed with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , how aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in organic terms , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with us is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own space , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears in the hands of the Dis@@ ci@@ pl@@ ine Unit of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they strike your words , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came straight from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who greeted her from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which gather like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg of portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of murder
a national human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who were looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder due to their alleged participation in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the Ak@@ tes des District Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several bites .
a warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead even at the scene of what happened , and det@@ ectives investigate the guards as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
since 2007 , she has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University .
Alan K. Cub@@ ans , the vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an email statement that she was now in a state of absence and was excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case investigated by the competent authorities and Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are willing to help U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly appe@@ aled to the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them strengthen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi told local , regional and national authorities to help susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zzling tip that said that something had happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation of the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will complete the WA@@ DA @-@ Road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ Prime Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timetable was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the Code , which describes the criteria for the re @-@ establishment of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the website of the Organization .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren on alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system got a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ a@@ v &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission .
in discussions with the Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was banned in November 2015 in the wake of dop@@ ing sc@@ andal as a result of the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the organisation in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA CEO Olivier Nig@@ gli said that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; moves in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the moment

the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to check the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she called people from outside for help .
a new Human Resource start @-@ up race is best to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit to pursue their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys by certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low approval results so that you can drill down why .
companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance sector could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Finance Website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
scent has nearly 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
I have recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent Companies can send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which employees can report bad behavior .
and when the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has caught the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ ting , employee turnover and complaints , &quot; Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has appointed Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives working in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen crashed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , &quot; Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
conc@@ ession received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million .
in November , gl@@ itter@@ ing secured themselves $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s venture partners and brought total funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of businesses , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only inserts .
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are doing good when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the changes are not fast enough or not at all , this can cause dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4.000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies looking too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for if you don &apos;t follow people , ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you take care of that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so ret@@ t .
and after gathering feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to better bonding of employees in an industry known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; Vit@@ rano said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled off their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are enrolled at the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Wasser@@ man Football Club next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was closed on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday .
therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they will perform 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ated on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task due to the clear sight lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ kin Centre , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already cleared a protective net behind a door@@ post .
Bru@@ ins will occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there might be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then adjust to drawing up an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a fairly good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
this is why I don &apos;t worry too much .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy fac@@ tual review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports from third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it &apos;s one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible mis@@ information and to send it to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors that may be able to view results of the fact check from the original article .
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political theme in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ water @-@ filled posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook spoke in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts will be started in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to the knowledge , which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes on his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a Castle in History of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his comfortable seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ opolitan Yor@@ k@@ shire man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says melan@@ cho@@ lic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Herzog , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotional .
&quot; I only responded to the thumb strain on the page of a letter , which was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell smoke because at that time they lit a fire because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers , he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting a little &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &apos; new &apos; castle , exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch .
he walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape instructors , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whis@@ key &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was granted full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks began to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , mess it up on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; you could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des said , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immer@@ se on a broader base in English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des said .
&quot; the uprising began in this area and I thought an insurrection was a good start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected with one another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was presented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug out ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; gentlemen seemed to be a cro@@ ok to keep debts and spend money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l &apos;s men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique write experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle gil@@ ded in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the disappearance of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) .
until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz &apos;s logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August it is said to be the highlight of the campaign on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the campaign have been asking for the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorf since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote on her website yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
in fact , we believe that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer we are citizens about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will pay an average five @-@ figure amount to its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the head of government , the five Vice @-@ Pres@@ idents and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers took part in the consultations .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the head@@ count .
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile @-@ pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating for this week in Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow attempt as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
at the end of February , the paper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ ease in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the army which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the header ban for soldiers , the newspaper wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in any case , the large @-@ scale suit in the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was firing another 73@@ 95 national servants by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered the masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as a guar@@ dian of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan returned the power of the military step by step , not least in appeal to the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is pushing for the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a particularly un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt from persecution in foreign countries , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
anyway , in the Alliance after the pur@@ gations , there is doubt about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration scheme to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media .
he fores@@ ees to reduce the legal Immig@@ rants to 50,000 a year , strict rules for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way the U.S. will change the way citizens from other countries are spending green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the present system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new procedure will benefit the candidate who speaks English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quot@@ ing US media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to san@@ e road for race shuttle
over and over again over the past few months , the future of the racing platform has been cont@@ ested - now it &apos;s going to be very quick .
even before the end of the year it is supposed to be built on the ailing road on which the tourist tram@@ way runs .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work on the track will begin again this year in order to secure the future of the racing car in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the range Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially important link for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he estimated the cost of repairs on the route to about 2.5 million Euros .
of this sum , the country will take up 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future , is currently defini@@ tively adjusted , declared S@@ üh@@ l .
the Ministry and the Southern Thurin@@ gian Railway as an operator have already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; S@@ üh@@ l said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
as a result , the racing stei@@ g Shuttle should be regularly ordered on December 2017 .
the racing stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the course of a pilot operation , the course has been tested over the past few months as to whether the route is used by sufficient number of people in order to order it again in the future .
the route is also in parts strongly bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it
just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can also &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his convi@@ ctions and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his finger@@ nails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
the real B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users , for example , to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xx Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adventurous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ gold has a personality , which is adapted to your personality as much as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics that are all@@ u@@ ding to rape if you take a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( called here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , be@@ wit@@ ched one the most .
on its website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xx ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or simply just another sex toy .
their origins and their increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something more ha@@ ze and deeper in our culture , to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .
most men will , of course , not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their rising popularity , they remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture .
but what se@@ eps out of the peripheral zones can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened in a time when there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women .
the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the worn bodies and the out @-@ out eyes , but how real@@ istically this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .
the aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women .
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no communication or background story , nothing that points to independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the saying of 2017 : ma@@ ids
pumps deliver great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense of man
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has become a b@@ ump @-@ wisdom of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Er@@ a that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , also split families in small @-@ format . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump relatives .
we are all preten@@ ding to be allowed to burst our filter bags .
less was noticed the power of tr@@ umps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tish poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .
with tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the repub@@ li@@ can relationship with whom she had fought for decades for politics suddenly and completely strange on the same side .
around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issuing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that his bi@@ bs of one day will no longer be rep@@ elled .
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can norm@@ alizes the right wing , which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison with its standards .
today I find myself inf@@ ested by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump are indeed a very mild crime .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the re@@ public@@ ans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the biggest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park@@ way , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don &apos;t need a caffeine .
the horses are huge , the fi@@ bre@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals twi@@ sting themselves to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ating music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is actually not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the Top@@ ic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not one - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
but the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a stran@@ gely magical experience , since here two @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 &apos;s can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately nobody asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only results in a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed .
the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of the experience to spread my credit card with five stars .
Oscar prop@@ ori@@ us with chest pain reloc@@ ated from prison to hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
last year , he was admitted to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist , which he reported to the prison authorities in a case in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death belt .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us Appe@@ al , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the neighbour@@ hoods from F@@ utzen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools .
three of the students will go to the secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
the 29 pupils of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle that grew up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch from his chickens .
instead of a hen house a little eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken out of him sm@@ ashed , and the eagle spreads his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
then the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ les carrying the cylinders to make the w@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the eagle is standing for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said chief manager An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , however , belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wished each one of the neighbor@@ hoods to feel accepted in his new school .
thank you to the colleagues , the former head of school Michael Müller , who has always returned to teaching geri@@ es , and the parents representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over now , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher made .
she did not leave her school very reluct@@ ant after two years because it was a really great time .
in the end she was able to rely on the four @-@ door si@@ re .
at the end , all students had a song of summer time and holiday time .
in the process , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted from television .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal camp people were arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released , while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed the control of the free camping and suggest to anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose , can impose considerable fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court may impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected now need to know
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the campaign ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
they are intended to improve the emission behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the negotiated software updates are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously apply only for the vehicles that have che@@ ating software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has been arranged by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
the manufacturers have announced quick implementation in the next few months , but have not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to write to each affected person .
if an inspection is due , that will be done in its frame .
how long will the conver@@ sions take place overall ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ ess . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , voluntary deal@@ er@@ ers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ orists who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
probably foreign manufacturers would prefer to reti@@ re , according to S@@ met@@ an@@ anin .
is a massive decline in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threat@@ ens ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas there is so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE advises to wait for sale yet .
ll Cool J gets Kennedy Center Award
Kennedy &apos;s Awards Gala is one of Washington &apos;s most gl@@ amor@@ ous events .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the prestigious awards at the prestigious Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the scholars this year .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar , who has been announced with progressive TV series , already announced that he will refrain from taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely ignore the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burdens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the position is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a City Engineer for 31 years .
and the work still gives him great fun as he communic@@ ates in the press conference .
he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his success@@ ors .
at the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - there is still plenty of time for an apprenticeship .
since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as an under@@ e building law authority , the applicant must present relevant degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it were no longer able to fill it , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but clos@@ eness to citizens is important to the city and to him , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some significant projects have accumulated , looking back onto the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the building department and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , diverse projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the park &apos;s park area are about to be found .
the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .
only the latter will be able to book about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my success@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great le@@ e@@ way for a city master builder .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own yard and gar@@ dener , it is possible to react very flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble of historic monuments , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is in place &quot; when new buildings are approved , emphas@@ ises the reti@@ ring city master builder .
anyway , the city master has a high level of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he can count on many years of staff in terms of supervision and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years .
also that his successor remains a long time , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
according to the town of Has@@ lach , who would like to be buried by Roland W@@ acker should be able to present a completed degree as a degree engineer or a b@@ achel@@ or &apos;s degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of building regulations and planning law .
the Municipal Building Authority is subject to civil engineering , civil engineering , civil engineering , underground parking , administration of municipal properties , Municipal Works Court with Bau@@ hof and Urban landsc@@ aping , as well as underground building rights authority , including landmark protection .
bicycle on lines thrown : Süd@@ bahnhof blocked
according to the police , the unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike on the lines of the railroad track crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) .
these were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and look for them since the night .
close to the crime scene , a ro@@ man sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been watched by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes well beyond a Laus@@ b@@ ben kingdom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ators , or the perpetr@@ ators , had put themselves in great danger , and also threatened mig@@ rat@@ ory traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the facility , as well as the delayed flight and the costs of moving the rail , also don@@ ors of the railway customers could get to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum was to go out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern run@@ way could be led without any obstruc@@ tions .
close to ten passenger trains had been enjoyed Friday morning , two of which concerned the long @-@ distance traffic .
freight trains did not fall , but they were delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food cannot enter the body .
cells capable of tri@@ g@@ gering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium devi@@ ates too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. repent@@ ant and a diet more tolerant to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan supp@@ ressed a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had been kept separate , did not .
it presum@@ ed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacteria species found in mice with immune cells were found , but without them missing in mice .
mice were tu@@ cked up in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system , the researchers led L. repent@@ ant into a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells , isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , which is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same tolerant sugar@@ s as mice and that most of us have L. repent@@ ant in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. repent@@ ant develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. repent@@ ant may lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho thinks that Manchester United has committed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday commen@@ ced , and impressed people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira on their way .
however , he had been excluded from the blues tour of the blues and only took 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho promised he had to improve before the premi@@ er league season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho got his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three further commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new commitments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new contract for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind is turning : as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still an SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only no fire @-@ fire from the party @-@ centre , but no head@@ wind from the federal government - so was the most important wish of the election fighters .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus &apos;s employees observe the events in the state capitals of the SPD @-@ governed state capitals with increasing terror .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with a counter @-@ wind .
there were deep stops .
one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green can simply not go@@ vern , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ ND &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fac@@ tional exit of a Green Party member has pl@@ ung@@ ed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the parliamentary elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner called on the stub@@ born low @-@ Saxon Green @-@ Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U is a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen has to give back its mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive and Ele@@ ction Manager of the Green Party to the German Edi@@ tors Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs as the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ bin &apos;s message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U after the res@@ ignation of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen combined with his own government majority .
it is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the defeat began with the un@@ expectedly significant defeat in the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , more not , had cal@@ med down the comrades at the time .
after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
that &apos;s what it got - and everything got much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the di@@ ver , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te beat the party smoothly .
the comrades were pain@@ stak@@ ingly ra@@ pp@@ elling again in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just had new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg arrived .
and with him came the next blow .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD district of the SPD , lost his nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city burnt .
and because in the crisis communication he did everything wrong , what can be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW ab@@ at@@ ement and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese Sur@@ ro@@ gation results were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the federal league over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former Mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s surroundings .
they let him go , as they ple@@ dged to stabili@@ ze the party from Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in the process , Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal pl@@ under@@ ing of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in the bottom of no fault .
and Schulz does not at all .
for the time being , comrades , therefore , make an effort to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen combined her own career with the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her person , but on the country list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens to the Parliament , according to the Dutch de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters tw@@ inkl@@ ing four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate in the German elections , the R@@ ND .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties distor@@ ts the election outcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments by the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for local nucle@@ us III
those who want to be rehabil@@ itated over the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives St@@ eg Stadt@@ entwicklung gave a sensation on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler again gave a review of what has happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been areas in which he has been rehabil@@ itated .
at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount .
in the Rehabilitation Area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler the previous refur@@ bish@@ ments are a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achievement project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - it is important to further develop the inner development , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on April 4 , the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III .
the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , amoun@@ ting to 500@@ ,000 euros from the country , the rest from the community .
how is a re@@ development area created ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned area at all to refurb@@ ish .
if necessary , the regional boundaries could also shift again .
the foot@@ bridge on Wednesday evening represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ lib .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal @-@ state program &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , that is , per plot .
the re@@ development area would then finally be set as a stat@@ ute .
the grant period for the funding proceeds from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 20@@ 26 .
however , until sep@@ t@@ ember this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock of the survey , as part of those involved in filling out a questionnaire for filling out a questionnaire .
in November or December , as far as possible , the set of rules shall be carried out in order for the renovation to commen@@ ce next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann then explained that every Commune had to carry out the said advance examinations .
it is about assessing the conditions of urban development and deciding when it is being rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective plot there will also be a remedi@@ ation note in the land register .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann would come again to sensi@@ tivities and make a picture of the situation she promised .
Got@@ ica pointed out that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the renovation intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing Bureau , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; information on the size , layout and inhabitants of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rain@@ bow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled out if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it is important to note that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .
moreover , new building measures could not be eligible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works - those who come first ground first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funds for later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos from the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown in order to make a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a consult@@ ative aes@@ th@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the castles of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock .

the White House &apos;s advertising costs cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a na@@ vy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military left to the TI@@ ME magazine up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior official of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the Connec@@ tic@@ ut helicopter has been exhibited beside a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wis@@ con@@ sin Fire Fi@@ ghter and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi fork @-@ lift truck .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation .
the news showed that on 17 July , the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3@@ pm and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of the service hours .
the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the aircraft during the time on the aircraft .
from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds as if you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deputy commander answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically advantageous purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft operated in the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are manufactured by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the vice press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set the U.S. President in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter sentences .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event included the training requirements of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a be@@ amer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicop@@ ters also flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers accepted the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to St@@ und@@ el@@ rates of the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 US $ per hour .
unit Records list the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting the costs for tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokesperson of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present this week of things made in America , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is of course appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .

the runner @-@ up of the second league of tennis matches the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will start at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
in spite of five games still flaw@@ less , the runner @-@ up of the second tennis league played a sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay , in any case , has respect for the opponent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially in the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the Far North are concerned above all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a look at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ eng@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser crew for the trip to the high North is convenient .
the Blue @-@ White debut could be Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
if the Fren@@ ch@@ man who is active at the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man does not join the Bundes@@ liga match , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) , which is playing at the Czech Liber@@ ec tournament , will be at his first deployment in this season .

how America can do harm to O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , Congress submitted a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he et@@ ched . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US thrust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft seems to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of the O@@ MV , who jointly co @-@ financed the construction of North Stream 2 in Eastern Europe together with other European companies , are accordingly troubled .
the dr@@ one is enormous .
however , it is too early to estimate the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .
he has twelve weapons at his disposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has looked at which the Group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put in the centre of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ co , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is far from over .
the three and four seasons have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show .
with the third season DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of drug traffi@@ cking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell .
led by four powerful god@@ parents , they operate like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions .
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ az@@ ar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .

reverse : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city again organis@@ es the day of the day .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban day@@ care centers .
on September 1 the city of Kre@@ feld res@@ umes the food supply in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in self @-@ control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooking will continue to be out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers refriger@@ ated cooling .
the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area . in 44 , the children receive a warm meal at noon .
in the last year of Kit@@ ay there were 28@@ 00 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat in the day@@ time in the day@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the delivered foods , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give off the meal , clean off , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven rough facilities - determines the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers are now firmly attached to the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , they are much more integrated and it is easier for the hospital administration to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about eating healthy food and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known strength in the ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen capacity , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison for the city , it says from the press office .
and this , although 46 sub @-@ tim@@ ers are re @-@ adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight for around 750 people in the training sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on 5 April .

G@@ MB concern about investments in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its factory in Glasgow , in the case of managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which is manufactured in addition to other products for hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; learn first &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ le &apos;s insi@@ sted on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expressing concerns that financing for the modernization of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the labor force focuses strongly on the local community and the Glasgow metropolis , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently requires a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a female spokes@@ woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to this because we value the continuous commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and in@@ secure economic climate , are constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a place of production fully and entirely . should our operations change at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona be warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga suits her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not pursue in its persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , after giving up an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the record of the world record ?
the sensational approach has hal@@ ted the transfer window in summer , as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G president ?
when Manchester City held interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish society expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves pop@@ e @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides ongoing discussions .
Christian Wei@@ stri@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he expected from the earlier Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Canon Bishop Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the pap@@ al Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false assessment of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence among the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
no one doubts about &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ pi@@ a , Histori@@ an and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public mind to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ pi@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and that &apos;s a bound Fres@@ sen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the mem@@ or@@ and@@ um of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he util@@ ises the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the clari@@ fication officer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; altogether 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were subjected to sexual abuse between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of over @-@ attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that by the master of the cathedral , R. in many cases has been used in many forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially in the case of high emotional appeal , the punishment for the students could be even more intense .
yet , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and that in many cases even positive memories are linked to him in many cases . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen near Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of violence against prot@@ esters at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the one hand , many students raise their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears to be a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible to the elderly when a cathedral @-@ kit brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is in it at all .
he is just once dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
you can , at best , repro@@ ach him , experience it too late or have taken first remarks not seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um on which he worked was perceived by virtually all those surv@@ eyed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes an excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotional appeal , which also led to wre@@ ck breaks .
he was deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the fact that he didn &apos;t just pop with chairs and threw the keys on the floor , but also par@@ ted and che@@ ek@@ ly guys to the hair or ears , he himself had already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period , the 1960s and 1970s , in both parents and teachers .
do you still know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state grammar school .
compared to what is actually going on in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ ella .
one wonders whether it is not related to his famili@@ arity and role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media have just r@@ ushed to him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently on the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , a lot was reported on the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also be accused of any involvement or complic@@ ity in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
none of the 67 victims of sexual assault con@@ tends to have entrusted himself to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of those concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who , professionally , would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Stu@@ dents R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is absurd to assume that it is calculated to him ... to have opened up inv@@ aders or more clearly or even more , than in relation to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust teachers , etc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , the report concludes with a clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in the run @-@ up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of any complic@@ ity .
so he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an adver@@ t .
therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these disgu@@ sting crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was to be read at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this repro@@ ach ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge che@@ ek of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the mis@@ use of the report .
namely , clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the high school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and violence @-@ exc@@ esses as well as , we say once , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the youths of sa@@ di@@ st teachers were har@@ assed and mal@@ adjusted , and suffered terri@@ bly , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with whom Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that , like most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the subject of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one was only happy to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the gym@@ nasi@@ um nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic power .
and that is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him in many cases . &quot;
at the most , the repro@@ ach remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself , and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then only about 1993 .
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently leave the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pre @-@ school will continue to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he recommended urgent intervention in view of the risk of negative press releases .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as Prü@@ fer had been banned in Bavaria long ago .
before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us probably knows .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the penalty was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n und Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pit@@ fall of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger of judging the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is already right there .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times , and not for what was f@@ aded in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , which goes far beyond that .
this is all very horrible and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked out .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. to draw ear@@ ne@@ es and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment has been banned , he has also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
which picture of his Regen@@ s@@ burger time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger play in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope ? &quot;
was the subject Prü@@ fer fine also in the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI tells of his perspective , as the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role .
nevertheless I do not conc@@ eal that he conducted a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world music from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and hard candy , one doesn &apos;t even make a big singer and stand before any success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming .
what kind of people did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger when talking to her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experiences over and over again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , deeply sincere , deeply @-@ believing and hear@@ tless people , of whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something for a fly .
I regularly get contact with him , like many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his education , visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral scra@@ ps are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them close to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , fa@@ ther@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but it was also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look up and worship them .
and please , once again quite clearly : all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have overcome this time long ago .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the state of affairs , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
