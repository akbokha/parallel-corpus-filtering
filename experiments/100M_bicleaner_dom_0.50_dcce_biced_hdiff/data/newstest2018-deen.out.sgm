<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners farm the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, because the car-sat showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bavaria-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are far from actual - but especially insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and communities have changed in the spread-area of the Münchner Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria Atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called "documentary sheets" were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were produced according to the Bavarian surveying business between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon had an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops were finally withdrawn with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: these were the present neighbors who created the idea of an area-wide Bayern Map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Palace of Surveying." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The data sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is, like all others, found on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison between early and today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was 21 years after the creation of the map, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first sight: when zooming into it appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called "original recording," from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "little parcels now occupy no more farmers" "" "land in the sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the scene of the October festival in 1810, was in fact a meadow - and not a concrete desert in the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the data sheet, in the area of the current district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the Gasteig" or from the hill "On the Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked up people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich district" "" "Irrenmodell" "" "was created" "" "On the Auer Lüften" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the chain of cigars." ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also prohibited the personnel from using violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients was first place, later on was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the gyro-pension in Haar, 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's biggest psychiatrists, has been located there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum are now meeting on the premises of the former Auer Anstalt, where young people meet at the Salesianum in Munich.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">The TSV Munich East soccer field is located to the west, east of residential buildings in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - an architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenberg, which was destroyed during the Second World War when bombing raids." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "Main Square" "" "by 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombing of the Allied forces broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A great one remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days will be the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-line.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the sliders the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizens rights group publishes Travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promoting of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is expected to enter into force by August 28, 2017, is calling for special attention to Afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to take special attention when traveling through the state and be noted, as a number of questionable, racially-based incidents occur in the entire state and will be noted here," says the group.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed Bill of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to accuse discrimination complaints, as well as the state prosecuting authorities that are disproportionately aimed at minority groups, prompted the group to release the travel warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the trip through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points out a recent report from the Missouri Office of Attorney General in which it is shown that black motorists are raised 75 percent more often than whites in the state.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring in deposit money or know relatives that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report program which classifies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th Rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had adopted immigration laws to arrest the local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration, which will contribute to further race profiling in the opinion of ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbacher Weidecca project is a successful project and will be continued next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-Association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the right-grayed courtyard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">At first Markus Schwendemann provides insights into his farm, where he farms 55 hectares of lawns and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and is accommodated in five apartments holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is the alternative marketing way for him for the milk of his cows," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste only regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also Chairman of the BLHV chair of Fisherbach, he described the electric fence project as" "" "essential" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably manage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides a lot of work, much must be handled with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "emphasised Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental plant and crops this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not conduct biooperation.</seg>
<seg id="79">For mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leaders."</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the areas could be dragged out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operation," "" "said the Mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion." ""</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of conservation area amounts to 40 hectares, which are not allowed to be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was promoted by Leader, one quarter bore the municipality of Fisherbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac said:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landlady you don't go." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "Peter Weiss also stated:" "" "the best food is produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Refugees Directive (LPR) in Baden-Württemberg enables the state-run grant of Weidebarns.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the openness of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be fenced can not be smuggled (inclination above 35 per cent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots, which want to be built just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Fischerbacher Weiflaunches project in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of maintenance is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged camber of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's proposals on the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty identifiers would have alighted him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took on its significance, and in particular the significance accorded to it, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, which was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta clicked, "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illumines the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is really right, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus, the only one in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich shores."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "eleventh garbage" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who started to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they executed a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the links between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early Neoconservatives that brings the American flame to the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual Limbaugh stumbled on something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great imaginative act was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">In the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">The statue of Jesus speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome which they must hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch shall not light the way, but ignite the hatred that is the only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">Championship 2017: Neil Black looses Scottish members of the UK team</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Her speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete at the 400 m hurdles at their fifth world championships, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The medium-sized runner Muir goes on this path and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman who was to observe the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games after a great season.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminiscing about her first world championships, when the only other Scotsman was Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and finals are involved.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympiastadion again.</seg>

<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: don't mess around a public office if you can't tolerate the burning of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He clicked in the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that is why the American Civil Liberties Union filed it at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">It has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of people who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum that is called officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Speaker, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound.</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer's Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented on politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the commentary section" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governors designated as a" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call others" "" "intercession." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one has done the same thing that employees have been sent to collect and burn papers with critical articles and to arrest or arrest protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who is criticized for having insulted Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, governor Matt Prein (R) also received a visit to ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of papers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous waltzes hit his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>

<seg id="274">These riches are, however, a source of misery for the Papua people who ensure that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport numbered some 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to one single officer.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electric-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of prepositions for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">So far, he has been suggesting that a part of the customers has already retracted their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the increasingly triumptuous figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla chief Elon Musk once again revealed another, less glamorous figure in announcing the latest quarterly balance: that of the cancellations at the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">Over the past few months, Musk has often advertised over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, the delivery of which has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now, Musk admits that 63.000 have already been withdrawn from the 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1,000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely back.</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such non-binding reservations envisage sluggish Musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">In the past year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be - 500,000 - one million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the Chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era's rules to reduce the emissions of smog-causing pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency turned out to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint lodged against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">This is a deadline which took place on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standards for bottomless ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">He announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or obstructing economic growth. "</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump County Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal on Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Prumah's regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay implementing a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his u-turn at ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the States through the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, the EPA has often kept the deadlines for carrying out, and then waited to be accused of activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who filed the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>

<seg id="465">Celebrating 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters of Tumbli their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württemberg Day of the Year: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, apart from the former parish church, there was also a glorious courtyard, which belonged to the church or patronal law, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also men there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As can be seen from the description of the Oberbayern Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the outskirts of Tumlingen, the "mountain" of the third, the magnificent settlement core of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around 1600 confirm these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The patronal law arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman, who built a church, furnished and occupied with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones of the two shredded on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be left later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were smashed and the bell parts were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops placed near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the church was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower of the tower still existing today remained as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cared for by the "Schaffy Rentals" as successors by Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius installation.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organizers invite the friends and supporters of Tumlingens on Sunday, 16th July, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The suburb Hartmut Romann is talking about the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="499">For the serenade of the Serenade, a trunk is held in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organisers explore the fantastic views." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumours and radio welders.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and supporters of Tumbli feel particularly committed to home care, such as serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="507">It was illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval, no wind turbines could have been approved at the time of approval in the Boisheim Nette, since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration area, the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the elimination of wind energy utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">These zones are intended to prevent "recess" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">The city of Viersen had passed a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette just a few days earlier, but the district government in Düsseldorf had not approved, because of a lack of form.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had closed lease contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, the power requirement of around 11 400 households should be covered - roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to purchase three wind turbines at the Linnich wind park near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="888">Eighty per cent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"" "in 432 cases the conclusion was that the person" "" "may be under 18 years old" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>

<seg id="892">"" "" "" "we don't see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant," "" "he said to the journal The Local." ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases where the person was judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over their age.</seg>

<seg id="896">The medical age assessment method, where x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are proceeding well.</seg>

<seg id="908">The building end is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be kept.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, clad with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red Buntsandstein.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10,60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach passed on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a peripheral mounting, which is also used as operating distance.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2,20 metre wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is going to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridges.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip sensitivity has required laying cables through the structure in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable where many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>
<seg id="926">Fish and crayfish had to be fished at first.</seg>

<seg id="1092">Schmidt, How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs?</seg>
<seg id="1093">I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print.</seg>
<seg id="1094">On the consumer protection portal www.foodwarnung.de, the federal states provide the most up-to-date information on the affected eggs batches.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Even if, after all, what we know right now, a health risk is practically impossible.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived?</seg>

<seg id="1102">If the residual oil content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded in eggs, these are not capable of traffic.</seg>
<seg id="1103">Unpolluted eggs can however be sold and consumed.</seg>
<seg id="1104">This time, the companies are not to blame.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?</seg>
<seg id="1106">According to current knowledge, production plants are not directly responsible.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football impact on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA, as the leading organization that supervises the European game has the power to prohibit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the wealthy ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to counter with legitimate sources of income which allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher affair.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current financial period of the FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini fell out of favour by the Presidency in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to frighten himself from excessive issues.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the Buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the redemption rate for the next five years in the amount of 44.4 million euros can be reported in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, hit the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies tied to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be deemed to be legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatari 2022 denied that Neymar World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymars Transfer, announced on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last fiscal year still have to be posted.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects that Neymar's arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after the signature will rise by at least 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going, and she tried to prevent Neymars move by saying that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of the La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>
<seg id="1154">Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger, whose association is owned by an American Sport-Tycoons, shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association.</seg>
<seg id="1155">"" "" "" "it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," "" "said Wenger on Thursday." ""</seg>

<seg id="1159">In recent years, Chocolat Frey Board Chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss Life.</seg>

<seg id="1161">Swiss-speaking entrepreneur Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report from the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1162">According to current plans, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.</seg>

<seg id="1169">As many applicants do with the new tender, Swiss will not want to give away.</seg>
<seg id="1170">But only Swiss producers come into question.</seg>
<seg id="1171">According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey intends to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1172">For the sda, the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achievable for a statement.</seg>
<seg id="1173">Swiss have been distributing chocolate tablets on board their flights since 2006.</seg>

<seg id="1183">Nostalgia goes into "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective" into the niche</seg>
<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80-s, for the 90-year Grunge era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-Comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as a franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" functioned surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humour (it contained an original story for an appealing cubicle that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).</seg>
<seg id="1188">By sticking to the core of the day - actors middle-aged play horny children, who will grow - they still managed to win the last part of the Witzes.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"ten Years Later," with his adults who now play adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes beyond the casting principle, including a riff on the Stalker movies of the 90 "s like" The Hand That Rocks the Cradle "(" The Hand That The cradle is shaking ").</seg>
<seg id="1190">At one point, a character rumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, has never forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost its virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy malicious plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd who shows Matt Dillons's whiskers from singles, whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of random delusions that could fuel this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he achieves what I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon now reminds of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east vs west wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka is to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled vor Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also a detailed producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice bags for watching (the police spends time watching chess on TV, as Americans may do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - ensures a decent game "Finds the voice out '.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" gets involved so much for the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">With six long episodes, it draws away, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective," rearranged to a lesser extent, could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The message for the imagined communist public is that Western culture can make it all for forage.</seg>
<seg id="1209">The fictitious Romanian writers were not wrong: we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Impact on drugs mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in beating the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as Konstanz public prosecutor announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 defendants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years ago and arrest warrants were already issued against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">Officials also ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">In the time of the same raids in Italy two people were arrested.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two are presumably extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators participated in the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1219">A total of over 300 policemen were employed.</seg>
<seg id="1220">The Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime, severe violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="1221">The public prosecutor's office Constance has been investigating the organised drug trade in Southern Germany since summer 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the State Department in Constance and Palermo, there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Therefore, on Wednesday morning, the big effort was accompanied by four civil servants from Palermo.</seg>
<seg id="1224">In particular, Italian citizens with close relation to the Italian mafia came into sight.</seg>

<seg id="1263">The Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation on an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">The Bank's political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members in favour of an increase in this month as weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In its quarterly GDP forecast, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% for 2017 and warned that the pressure on household income would continue, with inflation likely to rise to almost 3% in the fall.</seg>

<seg id="1285">Before the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for a rise in interest had risen, as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July.</seg>
<seg id="1286">Inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said this was expected and that it will be put on again in the coming months.</seg>

<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep has significantly reduced HIV transmission in infectious disease.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Prep before sexual intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">Those who come into question for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated.</seg>
<seg id="1301">In clinics, suitable participants identify those who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be reviewed by antiretroviral treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered by a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer ploys have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger space with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something similar to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot flat has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine for optimal use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">"" "that was my requirement," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 ft high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge consisted of creating a mezzanine where you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "" "" "the steel work is quite complicated," "" "he explains." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">It was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below. "</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms on top of each other - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The mezzanine looks down a classic copper skylight from Retrouvius over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in the addition of theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">On both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, sealed units can accommodate all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">By the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering went inside," "" "says Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counterweighty so that when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor area - or how your property will be appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they succeeded in enlarging the floor space and at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love electrical sockets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself by a good design and raised square meter of something by default in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave them.</seg>

<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Victoria in the value of more than 500 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp debate about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estates in value of more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold to USD 85 million in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De LUTIS now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments as well as shopping malls in the suburbs.</seg>

<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control over the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to incompetently manage some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event of hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Cheque Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first denim shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a steady course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House, which he wanted to repair: bad information that has fallen into the hands of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the people that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would get good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by controlling his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television is decades back - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs to convince," "" "said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "the Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping the Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. OK.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that trumps Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know others - that trumps tweets should contain more combustible material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his co-workers managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts were worth it.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversies.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">In May, POLITICO - fully engaged in this story - reported on the preference of the advisers to give the President for strategic reasons doubtful information.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former trump officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with shameful cheques, and that he insists on finding out where they come from.</seg>
<seg id="1410">This is exactly what happened in the end of February when someone intentionally maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by Gottschateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused Katie Walsh's deputy chief of staff to be "the source behind a pile of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chicanes, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Gold makers added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did this work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors still strive for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchangeable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, the hotel building was offered as a collective shelter in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees arriving in the county, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">At that time, the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels, Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>

<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The panel resumed work in recent weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal entitled to people familiar with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.</seg>

<seg id="1486">The investigators focus on several men who acted as advisors to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more trumps in his private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator Trump had personally moved into the centre and investigate whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Juries is to examine the evidence in possible cases of crime and decide whether to raise charges.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also referred to as prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="1491">They are usually turned on when it comes to bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office in order to invite persons for hearing under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN broadcaster, invitations were issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Those who participated in the meeting had been asked for a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr., Trump counsellor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his presidential candidate Paul Manafort also participated in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the exposure show that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>

<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a senate committee, Trump asked him for a setting up of investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special educator and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to be released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the president's margins from the Ministry of Justice.</seg>

<seg id="1521">The colossus heavy and 5800 square kilometres, which has a trillion tonne, now drifts north and will take two or three years until it melted.</seg>
<seg id="1522">With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant glaciers that researchers have registered over the past three decades.</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">According to research data, the extent to which climate change played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1525">But in total there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for around 30 years, the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) writes in a factual background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken Koloss was a part of the Larsen-C-Schelith.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Ice shelf floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelith lies south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this horseshoe the balance of growth and abortion was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher, Daniela Jansen, writes a complete ice shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are a lot of things that the Larsen-C-horseshoe is in danger, because the front edge has never pulled back as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the iron plate is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks off at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of ice shelf and icebergs does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI statistics, the Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now enters a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the widest retreat since the beginning of the records," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">According to scientists, whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will now grow back or fall back in the long term and possibly fall together, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers did not return to the destruction of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many of the polar regions of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctica extends to South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula has declined 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the last 50 years, making it one of the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants a hourly rate at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU demands to withdraw from the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, 41 new jobs were drilled in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have left their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">There were about 620 applications for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff in order to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently there are still 50 vacant jobs in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general management forces.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU would now like to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the desire of the parties, the administration should" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet the short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented careers of applicants.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should focus internally and externally, highlight concrete measures for cross-climbers and include a training offensive, require CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circuit has to deal with personnel problems you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is about a real" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This involves a high number of employees who leave the service in an age-related or age-related manner.</seg>
<seg id="1569">It is high time for action so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint request with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He was already in the circle day for a big surprise when he questioned the personnel costs and the rest of the parties stunned.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all possibilities to be examined, which allow exiting from the municipal employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not find a satisfactory solution here at short notice, the district administration with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should seek a hourly tariff," says peoples.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay more attention to the employees and officials as it actually foresees the public service charges.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are prescribed right now, increases or more money is only available when switching to a higher level, which orientates itself in professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned that NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean have warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Home Secretary Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis's warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation "Youth Rettet" because their team worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in a statement on the social media.</seg>

<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew takes rubber dinghy migrants on board, which are delivered to them by human traders, and that smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs that are involved in search and rescue missions have so far been prepared to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" "" "significant changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>

<seg id="1594">"" "" "" "Minniti now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit." ""</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome bonus.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">Viewpoints followed, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream plains.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for the long trials rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga pushes for E-Sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in future sit in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the stadium racing at wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">This has also recognised the first Federal Law Gazette, which is increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">At the beginning of 2015 the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports division in mid-July and signed two pros for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified for example.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"" "" "" "the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds in particular, that the young people will go to the stadium even in the future," "" "says the 52-year-old." ""</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With celebrity e-athletes under contract one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the national league to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-sport, computer games such as "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA will be contested at the competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, Ligen has long established itself, in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And for the Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobus has long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">Furthermore, there are cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and watch out for nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasizes the high integrity of the E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the move on an international level, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the Corporate Executive Consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-sport.</seg>

<seg id="1643">In three years sales are expected to be around 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Against the nearly 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little.</seg>
<seg id="1645">However, e-sport "is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or hockey," the Deloitte consultants write.</seg>
<seg id="1646">"" "" "" "internationally, many countries are already on the move." ""</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW claimed that it would be able to update the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The leader of the BMW Group said that "there are more intelligent options than driving constraints," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma.</seg>

<seg id="1777">In times, Mordillo was one of the most published cartoon characters, the noses of his characters are his trademarks.</seg>

<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "For there is too much suffering in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he envisioned among other things as a draughtsman for congratulation cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"" "" "" "the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," "" "he once said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made a breakthrough at the end of the sixties: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and insect-borne insects, which causes researchers and farmers trying to find solutions, causing great headache.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "lavender in Provence is effectively at risk, because in recent years the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an effect on the life of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zikade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is a lot of stake in the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfume and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and evaporation of evaporation from soil, but also spraying plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resilient to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly paper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings range.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's pay list or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the corpses pile up all over the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a Sonder Attorney Office was set up in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated by the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of murders involved in drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inseparable and even though the terrain is still treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without any information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for the discussion of safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"" "" "" "it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why we all mistrust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He just managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the "12th river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, suspected gangsters bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsletters.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security after the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003, he worked as an experienced journalist for Noroeste, when he joined five colleagues in the foundation of Riodoce and sold 50 US-dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drug problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and revenue and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved it to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be scared.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you think as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not tell what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce Team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curb like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office and always sit on the same table there.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine his destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">She also forced her to question her own assumptions about how to do her work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it if you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the annoyance is, the editor of the" "" "odoce Andres Villarreal" "" "said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">Days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen tried protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police, whom the Governor himself referred to as untrustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto in control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For this week's edition, Riodoce has written three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of former well-known driver Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to state expenditures focused on the home town of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group that was in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Public Prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was charged when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite pub of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which mastered all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locale, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman kidnapped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have regarded the column of Valdez as the best informed source about abduction.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we had known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication with our sources are broken." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected themselves: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and walked the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">In the whole country, journalists have become louder by writing down in organized protests "SOS Press," on walkways and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez inclaims the authorities to spy on journalists and kill them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, government officials and an equivalent company.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who put them under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "last year, the media group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">His unbelievably well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable."</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met something that was out of place by the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2.500 pounds (1,100 kg) of heavy Earth's lump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"" "" "" "it will go into history as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaur" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have discovered that this herbivorous, although it is covered with a beet and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counterfading, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed him to get better acquainted with his surroundings and to evade his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million-year-old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The surprising preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution encouraged the concealment of the confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most of the contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or shingles - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1948">Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also indicates that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including its preservative agent, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on his back to the seabed.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"" "" "" "this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin, but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when gigantic theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his furious ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the trade journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best-kept armoured dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20 inch long spikes that protruded from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armoured plant eater was swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater remission of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a gain in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I make it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Severe accident on Thursday evening at the A8: almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous injured, miles-long jams - and gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway (A8), about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass arambolage.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the first statements of the police there were about 30 vehicles between the connection points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm almost 30 vehicles, among them probably also trucks.</seg>
<seg id="1976">By the exact number of the injured, there are no indications at first.</seg>
<seg id="1977">A police spokesperson said that it was light to moderate injuries.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of rescue vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of travel in Munich, a distance of about ten kilometres was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As reported by an AZ journalist, it also came on the opposite course to massive disability - through numerous Gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the number plates of the vehicle handlevers who now have to reckon with sensitive punishments.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 p.m. a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>

<seg id="1986">Deutsche Bahn: group tests "Comfort Check-in"</seg>
<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced: nothing reminders you to sit in the train and sleep.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant mind.</seg>
<seg id="1989">And then: buffer.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Comes the conductor and wakes one unsanft or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1992">But the times of interruptions are soon over.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the most up-to-date ticket control.</seg>
<seg id="1994">You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and validate your ticket.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Currently, a test operation is running on two routes.</seg>
<seg id="1996">"" "" "" "if the offer comes, we expand it." ""</seg>
<seg id="1997">"" "it is expected to be available in many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "" "said a railway spokesman." ""</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "" "" "comfort check-in" "" "is the name of the railway ticket devaluation with no conductor." ""</seg>
<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And one must have booked an online ticket - which already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also important to have purchased the DB Navigator app, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">"" "because the" "" "comfort check-in" "" "works like this: you get into the train, call his ticket under" "" "My tickets" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2004">A button for the electronic devaluation then appears in the test customers.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train driver arrives at number Y at the ticket control, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">You can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">The "check in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is to use the passengers.</seg>
<seg id="2009">"if you want to travel without ticket control through our train attendant, you simply check out the DB Navigator yourself.</seg>

<seg id="2011">"" "second Plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket controls are among the biggest annoyances.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because oftentimes one has, in any case, one of the co-travellers not all the documents that one needs for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to show is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between driver and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket and the conductor at the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this can only be done at the connections of ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused as nobody else posted the information on their feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ theePharoah was continually saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was involved in tweeting the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Browns's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours there.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"" "" "" "that's wild," "" "Ferrell thought." ""</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put off her mobile phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photographs of the police band and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be a father's father holding a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed with a policeman standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman assured his gun and cried," "" "I'm going to kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2034">"" "" "" "this is not usual," "" "Ferrell remembered her statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="2035">"" "" "" "this is not the kind of murder we are accustomed to and which we can call typical." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and cried." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from November 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a history of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, which consists of the perspective of people living in the community and having filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation that they had" "" "over the black experience and the black condition" "" "countless times this morning." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2044">"" "" "" "we are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right." ""</seg>
<seg id="2045">"" "I could not take it with me," "" "Ferrell said later." ""</seg>
<seg id="2046">"" "" "" "what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past." ""</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">It must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do in order to be free to free ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would be a bad service to keep them away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the Police Department, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecutor of Officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There, Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped them pass them on to protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism totally changed after August 9," "" "she said, stating that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis the President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">One question came from Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of white people - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His involvement has brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals the Whose Streets team followed in the years after Browns's shooting.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we're talking," said Davis.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I will be portrayed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to concentrate on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result documents of Whose Streets show "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris's life, as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, which after the murder of the black teenager Trayvon Martin have shaped the film "Blackjack Matter" in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"" "" "" "black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," "" "Ferrell said," "" "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2074">"" "black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement really is held up by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmative type of action" "" "when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"" "" "" "she was the person tapping this energy," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it is not by chance, even though it was at the forefront, because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2080">"" "" "" "in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist." ""</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a chant and she feels bound to this memory, since she went on the street in Ferguson three years ago.</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers will discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall on the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The theme can hardly be cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one went to the bit gallery: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Showsten), comes from the other side: "no man needs" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers, the rest of which will benefit from the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer's market hall stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">"" "Simone Room:" "" "we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2099">Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the countryside ladies always like to be very happy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">We also discovered the butcher shop for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether there is a direct market in a market hall in the gallery, the amount of rent depends on the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"" "but the new project should probably not be very low." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what's the purpose of shopping in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One can see how many shop shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But as there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall will be preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there is fresh, is offered mostly directly from the producer and is also inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shop shops are only hired by larger companies in a shopping mall, as the rentals there are often unsustainable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Too bad, special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a Markthalle doesn't suit me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the Peasant Markthalle go during construction time?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>

<seg id="2120">And no one needs a shopping center that's empty.</seg>
<seg id="2121">In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market instead of this gallery.</seg>
<seg id="2122">But thanks to the insanely many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg give no place for a farmer's market hall.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Once the farmers market hall is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again. "</seg>
<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, there are many faces to be seen - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheeks-tuppers and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence, after she publically opened diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on August 2 is a Becoming resemblance (A fitting similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and a groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated from the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and from the 30 portraits were created, like someone with these genomic data, a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg was just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">The artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated mice became unequal eyewitnesses who, over the course of two years, exchanged several letters.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic book illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president was to transform judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama would actually demand only a few days after the book was published, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to flaming the rigid divisions he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning called with her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is endowed with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose basis was gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how astonishingly similar, at least in organic terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with us is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own space, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.</seg>

<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from her own genomic simulations, which gather like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2160">On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder due to their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the Aktes des District Court of Cook County.</seg>
<seg id="2161">The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several bites.</seg>
<seg id="2162">A warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead even at the scene of what happened, and detectives investigate the guards as murder while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, said officials.</seg>
<seg id="2165">Since 2007, she has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University.</seg>
<seg id="2166">Alan K. Cubans, the vice-president for university relations, said in an email statement that she was now in a state of absence and was excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University.</seg>

<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be.</seg>
<seg id="2171">Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly appealed to the suspects to face the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="2172">"" "" "" "the police have an idea of their place of residence, and our efforts to locate them strengthen," "" "said Guglielmi." ""</seg>
<seg id="2173">Guglielmi told local, regional and national authorities to help suspects.</seg>
<seg id="2174">Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip that said that something had happened in apartment 1008.</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that they were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2180">"" "" "" "we will complete the WADA-Roadmap in the near future" "" "- the Russian Vice-Prime Mutko" ""</seg>
<seg id="2181">Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it won't take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of Russian anti-doping agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).</seg>
<seg id="2183">"" "the WADA timetable was updated in this respect," "" "declared Mutko on Thursday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the Code, which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the website of the Organization.</seg>
<seg id="2185">According to Mutko, he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"" "" "" "everything was announced, everything is being implemented." ""</seg>
<seg id="2187">"" "and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," "" "he added." ""</seg>
<seg id="2188">One of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports.</seg>
<seg id="2189">"" "regarding the matter, Mutko said:" "" "we carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system got a mistake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2191">"" "but there were no state programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">Mutav's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission.</seg>
<seg id="2193">In discussions with the Russian sales office rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov answered problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added: "we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2194">"" "no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "" "added Smirnov." ""</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was banned in November 2015 in the wake of doping scandal as a result of the implementation of doping controls in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2196">However, it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).</seg>

<seg id="2203">The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to check the luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"" "" "" "there was never consistency and objectivity," "" "said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed." ""</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resource start-up race is best to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit to pursue their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys by certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most ailments and which managers have low approval results so that you can drill down why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies are coming to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The Global Governance, Regulation and Compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Finance Website Let's Talk Payments.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, the company helps to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Scent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">I have recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent Companies can send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main managing director is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has caught the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycotting, employee turnover and complaints, "Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites, has appointed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of policies and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, when an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or e-mail for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by executives working in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster - like discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen crashed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, "Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry from going online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">Concession received $10 million in funding in February by companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the total capital was raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">In November, glittering secured themselves $10 million in November of Bessemer's venture partners and brought total funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of businesses, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees are expecting more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley high salaries and interesting projects are only inserts.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more obligated to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are running well. companies are doing good when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Indeed, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the changes are not fast enough or not at all, this can cause disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4.000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International, who has seen companies looking too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "for if you don't follow people, ask," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you take care of that?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so rett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to better bonding of employees in an industry known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you will lose man," Vitrano said.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"" "" "" "and if you lose people, you also lose customers." ""</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.</seg>

<seg id="2260">It starts at 11 o'clock when a lot of UCLA footballers entertain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus.</seg>
<seg id="2261">Some have pulled off their jersey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>
<seg id="2262">For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.</seg>

<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days," "" "said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before the Monday was closed on Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three training sessions of UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved to the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras performed six seasons in Westwood practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They will perform 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmopolitan Yorkshire man with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says melancholic." ""</seg>

<seg id="2295">'a Castle in England 'covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Herzog, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only responded to the thumb strain on the page of a letter, which was written by a double agent in the 1700" s who worked for the Jacobins, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "" "" "this is his thumb print!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell smoke because at that time they lit a fire because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian 'new' castle, exploring the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape instructors, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "Whiskey" "" "and started to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was granted full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks began to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, mess it up on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards that represent what possessed: "you could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes said, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let everything go his way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes said.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was presented from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was dug out).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "gentlemen seemed to be a crook to keep debts and spend money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"" "other generations of Darrell's men solved their debt crisis by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2338">Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as in the past, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the head of government, the five Vice-Presidents and the Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs Ministers took part in the consultations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the headcount.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government is pulling the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff, Hulusi Akar, remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan fired 169 of the 326 generals and Admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile-preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a repuller of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating for this week in Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="2350">"" "already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the overthrow attempt as" "" "God's gift" "", "as he gave him the opportunity to" "" "completely clean" "" "the armed forces." ""</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have the army under control?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the paper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Unease in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">"" "in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing" "" "Islamization" "" "of the army which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the header ban for soldiers, the newspaper wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="2354">In any case, the large-scale suit in the army and the security forces continues.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan was firing another 7395 national servants by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry about it</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can also "adjust" his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot over the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The real Botix robot enables its users, for example, to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">"" "and then there is the Roxxxxx Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as" "" "Frigid Farrah" "", "which gives the impression of shyness and" "" "Wild Wendy" "" "with an" "" "adventurous" "" "personality." ""</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxgold has a personality, which is adapted to your personality as much as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics that are alluding to rape if you take a step towards Frigid (called here: resisting) Farrah, bewitched one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On its website, True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have Roxxxxx?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origins and their increasing sophistication point to something more haze and deeper in our culture, to retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will, of course, not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notices their rising popularity, they remain on the brink of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what seeps out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time when women's rights are threatened in a time when there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually assaulted women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the worn bodies and the out-out eyes, but how realistically this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">But, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots are not real women.</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no communication or background story, nothing that points to independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the saying of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Pumps deliver great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense of man</seg>
<seg id="2426">"" "" "" "it has become a bump-wisdom of the Trump-Era that the political divisions, which have polarized the US electorate, also split families in small-format." ""</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of trump relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all pretending to be allowed to burst our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less was noticed the power of trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leftish poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with whom she had fought for decades for politics suddenly and completely strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that his bibs of one day will no longer be repelled.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republican normalizes the right wing, which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison with its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself infested by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump are indeed a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the biggest of the carousels of the New York Parkway, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need a caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are huge, the fibreglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals twisting themselves to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perating music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not completely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is actually not a Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">But the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, since here two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40's can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately nobody asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only results in a slowdown of what actually should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server in order to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was apologizing, while I was tired of the experience to spread my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar proporius with chest pain relocated from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was admitted to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to his wrist, which he reported to the prison authorities in a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors against a first death belt.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed he had his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appeal, of which they say they are too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Prosecution Service said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2534">We make the city worth living</seg>
<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The position is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a City Engineer for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still gives him great fun as he communicates in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successors.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - taking notice of the regular periods of notice - there is still plenty of time for an apprenticeship.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administration community as an undere building law authority, the applicant must present relevant degrees.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it were no longer able to fill it, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But closeness to citizens is important to the city and to him, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as good mood between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2550">The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, even the stadium renovation is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Only the latter will be able to book about 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "" "" "all in all, great tasks await my successors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">In terms of design, there is great leeway for a city master builder.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslach's own yard and gardener, it is possible to react very flexibly to many.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the old town is listed as an ensemble of historic monuments, it is important to "have an eye on what is in place" when new buildings are approved, emphasises the retiring city master builder.</seg>
<seg id="2558">Anyway, the city master has a high level of responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is a builder," "" "in the end everything runs over my table." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">He can count on many years of staff in terms of supervision and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been in the process for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Also that his successor remains a long time, Wacker wishes: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the job."</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">According to the town of Haslach, who would like to be buried by Roland Wacker should be able to present a completed degree as a degree engineer or a bachelor's degree in architecture and have good technical knowledge in the fields of building regulations and planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall, but they were delayed.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products in order to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food cannot enter the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium deviates too far in the direction of inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell appears in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - in order to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. repentant and a diet more tolerant to tryptophan promotes less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan suppressed a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had been kept separate, did not.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It presumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacteria species found in mice with immune cells were found, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were tucked up in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria appeared on the immune system, the researchers led L. repentant into a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells, isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, which is known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same tolerant sugars as mice and that most of us have L. repentant in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. repentant develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential high tryptophan values in the presence of L. repentant may lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17 in the White House with American building programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The Connecticut helicopter has been exhibited beside a Maine Yacht, a Wisconsin Fire Fighter and a Mississippi fork-lift truck.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that on 17 July, the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn for the event at 3pm and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 this evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of the service hours.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the aircraft during the time on the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the recordings provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report relieves pope-brother George Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides ongoing discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weistrider, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," declared after publication against the German press agency, he expected from the earlier Regensburg bishop and present Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Canon Bishop Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the papal Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticized that in reporting on violence among the Domspatzen with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">No one doubts about "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation," the author Lucetta Scarpia, Historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public mind to keep it normal," "" "writes Scarpia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like to go to the church and that's a bound Fressen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "punches were a normal educational tool" "" "in their youth," "" "to deal with cheeky children as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It would be unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the memorandum of" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he utilises the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the clarification officer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "altogether 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were subjected to sexual abuse between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of over-attacks, 67 Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that by the master of the cathedral, R. in many cases has been used in many forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially in the case of high emotional appeal, the punishment for the students could be even more intense.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Yet, unlike many other defendants, many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and that in many cases even positive memories are linked to him in many cases. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen near Georg Ratzinger is relieved.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "incidents of violence against protesters at Regensburger Domspatzen," "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"" "on the one hand, many students raise their" "" "humanity" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears to be a choleric and perfectionist, which became tangible to the elderly when a cathedral-kit brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just once dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can, at best, reproach him, experience it too late or have taken first remarks not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the Domspatz gymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually all those surveyed as" "" "redemption," "" "" heaven "" "" and "" "" better world "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="2918">So the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes an excellent testimony, describes him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotional appeal, which also led to wreck breaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">He was deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he didn't just pop with chairs and threw the keys on the floor, but also parted and cheekly guys to the hair or ears, he himself had already admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period, the 1960s and 1970s, in both parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you still know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state grammar school.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually going on in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are certainly bagatella.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not related to his familiarity and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, a lot was reported on the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger also be accused of any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">None of the 67 victims of sexual assault contends to have entrusted himself to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said one of those concerned," "" "It was all very embarrassing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with the explanation of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust their parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who, professionally, would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "Michael Hesemann:" "" "concerning sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator." ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it is absurd to assume that it is calculated to him... to have opened up invaders or more clearly or even more, than in relation to their parents, dormitory managers, trust teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">"" "that one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "in this way, the report concludes with a clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their surroundings affected him in the run-up could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of any complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to an advert.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these disgusting crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, much of" "" "excesses" "" "was to be read at Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "looking away" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this reproach?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed up in the coverage of a huge cheek of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Namely, cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the high school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and violence-excesses as well as, we say once, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">All the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the youths of sadist teachers were harassed and maladjusted, and suffered terribly, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face when they were already at the cathedral gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that, like most witnesses emphasise, the subject of" "" "preschool" "" "was taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "one was only happy to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiac" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the gymnasium nasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic power.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And that is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, even combine positive memories with him in many cases."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the reproach remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported from the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71 when he began to establish himself, and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then only about 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently leave the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the cathedral gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "the pre-school will continue to practice the punishment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">He recommended urgent intervention in view of the risk of negative press releases.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as Prüfer had been banned in Bavaria long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us probably knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" "" "pitfall of anachronism" "", "that is, the danger of judging the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times, and not for what was faded in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, which goes far beyond that.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very horrible and I'm glad that it will finally be worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishment, i.e. to draw earnees and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment has been banned, he has also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Which picture of his Regensburger time did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book "My brother of the Pope?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Was the subject Prüfer fine also in the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI tells of his perspective, as the Domspatzen played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless I do not conceal that he conducted a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world music from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and hard candy, one doesn't even make a big singer and stand before any success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger when talking to her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experiences over and over again as wonderful, humorous, deeply sincere, deeply-believing and heartless people, of whom one cannot imagine that he could also do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get contact with him, like many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his education, visit him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral scraps are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them close to the world of music.</seg>
