28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , he went up again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse , found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the Judi@@ cial Department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was clas@@ sed as murder and that the investigation was running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , announced his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters &quot; restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss it pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived at host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him were finally going uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
connecting his way with his family was to cook us a little while preparing dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of discussion .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the stream .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the post@@ code of the SF@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
Hollywood star has made it un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always put in drawers or get stuck on the outside label , which usually has little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather dum@@ b to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about her being &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan magazine .
the act@@ ress likes to spend her time at home , in front of the television with a delicious de@@ bris and Mexican food , it says in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to the white draft she raises the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting on 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyrami@@ de
his experiences on horseback are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues was looking for a little change with a ride on the beach .
it was a premiere for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted back home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p at home .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus the riding career ended again .
Saturday was Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer ever - 101 tournament victories - once again close to horses .
he was able to lead his family through the system of the AL@@ RV , he couldn &apos;t even swear to a horse for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid .
there is no lack of hon@@ ors to the symp@@ athetic athlete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ ne lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the Queen of England has already rebu@@ ked him .
a long one is the 18th prize winner of the pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talent .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the double U.S. Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the former Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ rider Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um@@ the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ ste@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza cost ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger maintained distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential candidates are not one of the tax and energy policies , as well as in a fundamental issue .
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamental , rather philosophical .
that , on the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton hopes to tax the economy and regulate his death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will massi@@ vely re@@ tract regul@@ ators , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has opportunities to open up dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it .
that is why taxes for the rich would increase , &quot; she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the future , Tr@@ ump and Clinton said almost verb@@ ally .
the democratic candidate has announced the greatest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical tea party wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
there may be party internal discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re@@ tract coal mining in the US .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate .
Clinton , on the other hand , intends to explicitly extend and demand renew@@ ables with its investment programme : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the trans @-@ fu@@ gal trade agreement , both do not want to sign .
at the same time both , however , do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better .
they should be paid even better , Clinton asks .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a star@@ vation .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must be drunk , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics are keeping it , making the budget deficit worse .
on the other hand , Clinton , who at least demand from the rich wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fle@@ eing woman has experience with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing alone , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby at most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he gaz@@ es curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother gaz@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is watched .
she sm@@ iles briefly and kis@@ ses the little one .
the scene seems normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria and deals among other things with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are chicken .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ central shel@@ ters for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs established the facility with Pro Famili@@ a and the Münchner Frau@@ enh@@ ilfe e.V .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experience with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them as ray @-@ makers to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal away because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have gained experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run , this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example are demanding a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
who believe that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , er@@ r , tells B@@ ahr .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and at worst mis@@ used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that about 90 percent of women living in the Munich North are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodation just for them , B@@ ahr calls .
in Bavaria , the seven district administr@@ ations are responsible for refugee accommodation .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in accommodation of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are stor@@ eys or own homes only for single women and their children in some congreg@@ ational shel@@ ters .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committee also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy or the men and women are accommod@@ ated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the wash@@ rooms should be separated and accessible to women easily accessible in the study .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the urge to get to the house in Munich .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us to exist , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors fight : demands for new working combat measures
assistant veter@@ in@@ arians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new measures for action in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more competition measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that ministers would have ab@@ used to respond to the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the president of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently calm@@ ly &quot; would have remained a problem , leading to the rejection of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Board today filed a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating working competition , which begins at the beginning of September .
the con@@ ten@@ tions led that assistance specialists struck six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A Regi@@ stra@@ r , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians and medical students , stating that the contract should be beneficial and accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the Treaty of Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight months &quot; long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish counter@@ player in the gil@@ ded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny myself that Ankara would most want this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile worked narrow@@ ly and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan once again spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but could even be improved .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten anything .
on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow reaction to the time was arous@@ ed .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater , as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to rebuild the c@@ ous@@ y becomes difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months the state @-@ controlled media launched a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations from senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s areas controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdo@@ gan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after having reli@@ eved almost his office last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late @-@ season attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ gh@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , as it regards its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the continued gru@@ dge about the slu@@ gg@@ ish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
for Moscow , this is clearly a matter of course , which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as an analy@@ st once described to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that feel abandoned and treated badly by the West and are now al@@ lied .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they had not even touched on the subject .
the President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since then , when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this time brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported international sports with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the distributed headquarters and stock exchange notes will switch to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for retail banking , which will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investor stamp and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals .
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue with the Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the bank of brands , because how do we concentrate within ourselves ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and would have launched these trademarks .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches 3,@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ ,000 wins
the Jo@@ ckey Fran@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th bri@@ tish win at New@@ market on Friday .
he sat on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local race track with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won at G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar before , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very humble .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ ering when he gets the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner , Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern times and it &apos;s no surprise that he has reached this milestone reaching only a few before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans have enth@@ r@@ alled fans for years for this sport .
I told Frank@@ ie some weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already won 6,000 gains if he was not only a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already scored nearly 30 years in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible Jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying dis@@ mount
flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of the British f@@ low@@ race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a number of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived an airplane crash and was banned from drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month locking , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his skep@@ ticism and return to his best form .
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue at competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly released his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of the tigh@@ test confidence of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for E@@ viron@@ mental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a deputy to Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , has been appointed his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tall@@ inn , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later became the director of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Gover@@ nor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State on bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked him to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ dan@@ te and works like him for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ns on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows that at this time .
but the official statement - that a man who once was tou@@ ted as a potential president should at once want to lead Russian environmental policy - stum@@ bled upon great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated job - you could almost say - to entr@@ ust the complain@@ ant for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov one of five people whom he trusted the most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination of the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ olog@@ ised on Thursday before announ@@ cing his termination .
on the set it came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ sons of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is written out , are expected to be released at a later date according to ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a communication published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible anymore .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the 12th season will be scheduled for 28 September .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in garden in Ban@@ ff
one of Ban@@ ff &apos;s inhabitants called for help in identifying fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could act around sand e@@ els that were sp@@ illed out by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
fifth Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four se@@ al@@ ings of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ceiling blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 be@@ vel ropes .
the project is expected to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ et cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of truly epic dimensions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
all in all , almost 79 % of the deck &apos;s entire deck and the last section of the deck got a d@@ ong@@ ation for the deck today in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of forward @-@ looking construction and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the North Tower , we had to close the existing gaps on the north or the land side .
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern bridge crane bridge 700 milli@@ metres to the south .
this was a massive yet very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3 % .
delicate as the toler@@ ances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; happiness still alive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after they were thrown off by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat rolling around and imagined the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds blow the boat out of its reach , until we left it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing vessel , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who have been thrown into the water have happiness un@@ hurt and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boot engine had an emergency stop , but it released from the person who was steering the boat .
someone has watched over these men today .
seriously injured - man stab@@ s his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcohol smu@@ g@@ gler broke the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
when she came into the apartment , he came to her twice .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured in his hand and on the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothing , he called on his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ companions on the road .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend .
who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : in the future investors should be much more obliged to do so .
how does one react to the bad news that in the next few years , Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable housing ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; living concept &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but stri@@ fe is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if anyone wants to build on urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments must be rejected as social housing in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in stock .
however , the major issue in the town hall is , &quot; said Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and still be financed is to provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few rules as possible .
the left wants to impose tough@@ er jobs for investors .
despite this , Brat@@ mann said , a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market is taking place .
if the concept of action is implemented , this will provide additional tasks in the building administration .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should already be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of some 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire in the coming years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to the budget@@ ary spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , now bor@@ row bonds should be bought from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back to price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
the problem could be solved at one stroke .
because in the West@@ stadt , Fri@@ sten is running at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments could be picked up there in price binding for affordable apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing corporations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased , the aim of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mixing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is removed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family houses .
what does not mean , however , that a compromise cannot be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
the fact that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside for playing , but rather prefer to spend their free time sitting on screens has been mour@@ ned by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about bringing people off the sofa and letting them become more active .
the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games , and last but not least on smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s ( later emerged from it a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand was falling in the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed due to the massive demand the servers were over@@ loading .
within a few days , Pok@@ emon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go out with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ emon that can be traced with a GPS and , once found , &quot; fot@@ ograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger joined the ma@@ dness and jumped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the US , the game has led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person puts back every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
car@@ dio , an app for Apple Watch , who followed up to 35@@ ,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people , who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes , and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here .
but the wonder@@ full thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them .
thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
as always , there are also mur@@ al players who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s it about ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time .
however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in women &apos;s ur@@ ns
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ it is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breath taking on the floor .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast reached the competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team camera A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American women of Sim@@ one Bil@@ it tur@@ nes on the floating bar during the single multi @-@ day campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ it is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual Americ@@ an@@ woman who wins multiple competition titles and in total the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ it has dominated the sport over the past three years , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected a final test in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ it and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ camp in@@ ale of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ a won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clam@@ ation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
although she insi@@ sted on having never planned the future for her long path , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - including their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ ee A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gym , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 she hasn &apos;t lost any competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as she wishes .
although Mu@@ staf@@ ina slightly led through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
bri@@ efs and floor gymnas@@ tics - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
she got back again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still took one on it .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears f@@ lowed on bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection @-@ book became reality .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , which is called &quot; grand@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after their ground training , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ arks back to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which at times seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ al is concerned , the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in serial kill@@ ings when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and heard music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently escaped with another vehicle , is read in the report .
the police reported that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokesperson of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting encouraged the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks .
a total of seven people were killed in his@@ panic living quarters within four months , and two others were injured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site .
one witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that crashed onto an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about whom his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I can &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s wrong at all -- of course , you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they suggested to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t talk .
but it is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing something out &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic such as Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the target virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional cost of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I have been asking for a pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I do not expect it to really tell me .

violent rainf@@ alls , floo@@ ding gives rise to ba@@ il@@ out in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency booth on Friday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded their shores and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding following extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already underway to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa alone would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
a flood early warning system was deployed in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama on Friday while it was still ra@@ ining in the Mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers can flood many homes in the nearby bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a flood @-@ directed flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are only slowly flowing down into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the rivers .
the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still be@@ headed people from the flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ be on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that the waters of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house , increase dramatically over night .
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water was streaming and pouring in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife said that in the 48 years she lived there , she had never seen such a high level of the river .
he and his family members said he would have all the obstacles and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread rapidly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities would consider ev@@ ac@@ uation operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the rain has been considerably wat@@ ered by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy rainf@@ alls and floo@@ ding floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and L@@ ess@@ on in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa took over 200 flood @-@ flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated into two churches , both of which were now flooded .
the leader of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed up by floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa nearly two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags provided for the inhabitants who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the municipal administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy told Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys that it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday they have not been reported until now .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ man , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; T@@ own@@ son said , &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police report that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown had multiple shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital when he was transported to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body has been blown out of bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z told the station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was classified as critical and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the broad@@ caster that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people shot at German@@ town .
also shot three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car with the 29 year old , who finds himself in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , approached the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a continual battle .
on the street , on both sides of the walk@@ way , shells were located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Bri@@ gade Anthony G@@ inal@@ di to the police in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a torture fan when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
it re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I present to me under the Women &apos;s Olympic Championship in the Tur@@ nen and that for more than one reason .
first of all , I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant .
and secondly : this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had an inspiring effect on many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic is round off , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among female gym@@ na@@ sts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic champion and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the thre@@ ef@@ old world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they provided unexpected yet master@@ ful gy@@ n@@ astic routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual amer@@ ican who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but so do gym@@ n@@ astic classes in the whole country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all took the same path as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to get it to the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four female gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts are primarily in private gymnas@@ tics , maintained by parents for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these sports clubs are located in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs , which can support the business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to offer to the municipalities of countless young girls who are inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach exercise training .
I founded my gym of 20 years .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable tour@@ ist@@ y in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the young high @-@ quality gym@@ n@@ ast that will make it possible to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
it &apos;s the crew &apos;s inspiration for thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you so many young girls with backgrounds seeking to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors want to organise more strikes after Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal rejected
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7,@@ 500 assistance doctors who voted in a vote rejected it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in July Hun@@ t had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and any further delay would be harmful for the staff and patients . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first assistance specialists are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the care at un@@ scheduled times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistant Doc@@ tors , shared last night in a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed treaty , especially that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and to address all the physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time is running out .
efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through talks joined the government on reluct@@ ance to participate and sometimes on ear @-@ de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had just made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the lift and address the worries of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he fails to do so , the assistance specialists have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further training measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike chain .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A would like to pay a better week of the week for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance physicians that are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , asked the assistants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working competition measures do not achieve anything that is little , but strain already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , nursing staff and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past two months , we have spoken to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who are returning from a vocational training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , continuing education and the Ministry of Health regarding the compliance of the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce the risk of heart attack
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug after being recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people suffering from heart disease .
the medicine is administered for 12 months following a heart attack , which reduces the risk of a stroke or a further heart attack .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority recommended a four @-@ year intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulatory authority recommended a four @-@ year intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls which form plaque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that c@@ logged the flow of blood to the heart , causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention a quarter of all people who suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing other heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture revi@@ ves electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office
a Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness culture has led to broad@@ ening electoral fraud in Muslim communities know@@ ingly ignored like a devastating governmental report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town councils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the former Minister of Integration and Public Affairs who is now a corruption @-@ king said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of religious motives would be so bad that the police were allowed to set up lock@@ ers out of voting boo@@ ths to protect timi@@ d voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should take a document to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present a vot@@ er must only call his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non removable ink to a person &apos;s finger if they give up their vote to prevent anyone to choose twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have access to community documents and decisions by non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud that goes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral campaign in the east of London .
last year , a Special Administr@@ ative Court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was to be reli@@ eved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry after a lit@@ any .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racial and Islam@@ opho@@ bic charges .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud across the country .
he expressed particularly alar@@ ming about the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of mail - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including leading evi@@ dences to prove the identity
&quot; &quot; &quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as proof was established that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... governmental institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric added 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban on political activists to edit post @-@ electoral materials in order to stop &quot; harv@@ ests . &quot;
the report , taken into consideration by Ther@@ esa May , also calls for tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral register being used for the purpose of immigration and social fraud .
options to consider choosing to ask for your ID before choosing .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent anyone to choose twice .
conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for automatic writing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists edit complete letter sel@@ ections and envel@@ opes of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; correspondence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up lock@@ outs for elec@@ tive stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in law facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
no photography in election stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the election stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that the workers enforce the rule that voters alone go to the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case there was no complaint filed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons relating to the high requirements of criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check@@ out controls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Jud@@ gement Day in Tower Ham@@ lets of the last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country , as the mother of parliam@@ ents , bears a proud heritage , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous doppel@@ gan@@ gers of Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ lern in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio are out of the br@@ ink this week by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gänger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only athlete who has his own famous doppel@@ gan@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ pping on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , on the left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood
besides Kate &apos;s doppel@@ gan@@ ger on the rac@@ et@@ rack , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi could be Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after images on which he looks very similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see any big simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons ever since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ br@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes is supposed to go through as a doppel@@ gan@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh were compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one hall@@ way : this user thinks that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Drama
another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ cute , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian has att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , on the right , have a similar face form and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities .
theory put into space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which shows her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian radio station C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; like M@@ ief died &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m fre@@ estyle multi @-@ squ@@ ad@@ ron to give his own opinions .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought on board in the commentary team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; color , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , as down as M@@ ief , he died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese float in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the scale 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor rod , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China .
spectators throughout Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ ail@@ or twe@@ ets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just say that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was fast and hard , many of whom were talking to him
Twitter users did not keep back when they heard how un@@ aware By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another t@@ witter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and makes us all look like ra@@ cists . # disgu@@ sted .
shortly after , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comment and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times in the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt about Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s behalf
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on the show and our fo@@ als in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron is very sorry about what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast , trying to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am referring to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ tra@@ ged by a woman who sham@@ elessly tries to under@@ wear in the middle of the business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try bot@@ toms .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation , she looked out as she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf .
she continued to rum@@ mage and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the pri@@ mar@@ row store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman offered the under@@ pants before she put her back to the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she &quot; rek@@ ind@@ led her and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales floor , she took off a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled off her own stock@@ ings and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a little discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , drew herself again and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it didn &apos;t seem to bother anyone watching - or thinking about the person who might buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ antly one would take under@@ pants with home that someone else had and which were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees tried to pull out the pieces of clothing after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled it out and didn &apos;t get washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect oneself against weapons attacks by Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your rob@@ ber around the sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you get closer to you from behind , then you should turn first , so that you can see your aggres@@ sor and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go out of the shot line , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat it then with the knee in the gro@@ in and twist while the attack@@ er bends up against pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon on him .
in the case of attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it , so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
at the same time , put weight on the weapon and strike the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and strai@@ gh@@ tening the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to over@@ reach your money - unless you are a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right ab@@ bot for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller with@@ drew his immune system and pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic of a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k turned his train on a euro note , a ban@@ ker at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pur@@ ge button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before dropping each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into .
but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea to lick the rinse button of a tow@@ ing toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and about his own health .
fortunately nothing left him , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known for testing the resistance of his bow@@ el by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public places at stations to flush dum@@ pling of toilets , the task was definitely put under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film , he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test painting showed a lumin@@ ance number of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ance number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after her lumin@@ ance was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60 .
Mr W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve ger@@ minated in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we carried out crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , which ended in saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had ordered him to lick , just like the ec@@ lec@@ tic Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associate lac@@ tic acid bacteria especially with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products that contain added lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ soci@@ ale demol@@ ished before del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance with a damage of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , sho@@ cking employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls had ri@@ pen@@ ing holes , wooden beams were pil@@ ed up , garbage was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she now lives in a private apartment
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who worked for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment could no longer be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is as well .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had caused , street fights with bas@@ eball bat , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
in the property in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn down
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call police on a regular basis
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ im@@ ited her and her partner forci@@ bly this week from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t bother anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this morning we couldn &apos;t sleep . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have ab@@ used the family to cooperate with the local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , 20 years long .
garbage and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the tenants voted to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance is always the final step of considering Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work that my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ sion on the floor .
workers of the house administration will have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police said they will deleg@@ ate tenants who do not abide by the house rules
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall informed Angela C@@ row that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance was a clear warning to the other tenants unable to abide by the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach as well as to those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate anti @-@ criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after a sub@@ stit@@ uting military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air Force aircraft put an incredible crash
the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight but insi@@ sted that there was no risk of security .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ er@@ ent jet falls over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost close to the sun @-@ worshi@@ ppers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the tourists jumped up when they were understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the towers , without seeing what was coming to them by the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane dropped down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were panic @-@ driven when the airplane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said the jet was somewhat lower than usual due to poor visibility due to the poor visibility conditions , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk .
land fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where even four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to circumstances - strong fog and smoke smoke - that limited his view .
the plane was on a training flight , in which the pilot needed to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise

Ma Long in its own league to table tennis ball
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4 ) .
thus the world ranking list @-@ first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia .
bronze passed to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ ko@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the highest Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sets and in time @-@ outs they didn &apos;t have coaches .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches so far I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang had said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the game gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really strug@@ gled with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
after that he determined the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
due to the superi@@ ority of Ma , the expected ro@@ using match did not develop .
but nevertheless there were enough spectacular ball changes to be seen .
Mi@@ dou@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an experienced a rib@@ cage injury , but after that it was in medical care that &quot; ultimately , &quot; had to be satisfied with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were , by the way , in the same high table tennis tournament Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte .
Donald Tr@@ ump imag@@ ines &quot; huge problems &quot; in election campaign
the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive fears , even in traditional conservative states to lose its majority .
the presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , has now fla@@ gged his election campaign in U@@ tah &apos;s Republi@@ can strongh@@ old .
a rare moment in which the mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary , which is usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , vo@@ iced something such as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
after throwing 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubts about his success are now growing in the fight for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have enormous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media cu@@ ddle .
repub@@ li@@ can strongh@@ olds sweep
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ US in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival were equal to the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
as endangered are also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview by the station CN@@ BC Tr@@ ump replied to the question how he wanted to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the same as I did so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is doing nothing else than telling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump has threatened to cut mon@@ ies to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present better results .
instead of this , the candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans would be stronger than the poor for Congress .
Olympia : thir@@ teen sc@@ am at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee on the case .
Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro State Olympics .
Kenya sent a coach home after an attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials announced that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i .
this was reported by the team leader K@@ eni@@ as of the dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF World Association has asked the IO@@ C for information on the case to impose its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures taken by the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will judge an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping Control Station and released himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , released and signed the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as head de missions Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who was on the list for the training control of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i had become more than 800 meters in the Beijing world championship runner in 2015 .
four days before , the Ken@@ yan Senior Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation , Michael Rot@@ i , had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed sports@@ men of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya is already under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences for a longer period of time .
in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was stran@@ gely advised that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency exercised a lot of pressure on African countries before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic commen@@ cement .
as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya benefited from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control was compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won the most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there will be a considerable mentality of sports fraud .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that this type of sport has been systematically and systematically sub@@ du@@ ed .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then expelled from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins Master@@ piece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her love with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary !
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so it is clever , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as Rö@@ mer@@ ich , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; most up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want them .
these are the same topics , and today they are as expressive as at that time .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was thought that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one can only hope that the only good is there - as warning and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the East of London went into a plane in the direction of Turkey and subsequently boar@@ ded a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tana &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in case of a victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , Leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands approval since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late judge at Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia &apos;s Supreme Court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with some degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulate .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants to make a nu@@ dis@@ m calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to publish a 1970 &apos;s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked human beings , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his naked magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys differ because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
it seems that Calendar also does it .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release about the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anyone who does not fit and lo@@ oses Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and the World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kur@@ ds community Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of people seeking asylum seekers who fled to Germany from Turkey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ ds community in Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday .
because the government had already covered Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ unity already months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds in Turkey were fle@@ eing .
after the failed put@@ sch , there were still secular and opposition ethnic Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees itself has produced refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the association compla@@ ined of the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities .
Erdo@@ gan is planning to raise the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or driven over the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the Association called for the Federal Government to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharply as Austria positioned against Erdo@@ gan and his followers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , above all Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len pendant exter@@ min@@ ates teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; he who does not fit and lo@@ oses Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way the Kem@@ alist and Hercules , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chair of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the paper reports on figures from the Federal Ministry of Internal Affairs , the Turks have already placed the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognized for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
as of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognized as a member of the Y@@ e@@ V ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this survey , there is no battle against war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually followed .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia cannot vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , they have understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2021 will not resume the country &apos;s election directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because stupid as yet it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and country elections - that bites .
the locals , who are to be persu@@ aded by the campaign fighters , are on holiday .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not locals , so they are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day .
there are practical problems : during the holidays volunteers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count votes in the end only work hard to apply .
until 4th September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign short of the people over itself once more .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , head of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
it is exciting how much new@@ bie Af@@ D will cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition programme .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years of age and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ases a little with the people , just as his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , Se@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the thri@@ ving of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is if you make an election campaign at the wrong time .
she has twice been invited to German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel . Merkel &apos;s parliamentary election is in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony then as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , general secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the North @-@ East CD@@ U largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions at market locations and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that means co@@ king , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Union has also noted that on the country you have to brush up the base , that it has to work very hard to find a wire to people again .
it goes like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any one in the sides of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor Kok@@ ert is self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where the people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , any birthday party must be used . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign .
in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats were la@@ gging 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in the election of 2011 , the SPD had still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are expected to make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue out of the need of a holiday and transfer their election campaign largely to the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the name of the regional president , Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise , green campaig@@ ners gather for search for traces of local voters among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the lakes of Mecklenburg and finds it beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ref@@ ur@@ b@@ ishment : restaurants are suffering from blocking
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8@@ pm , there is everywhere praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week until the end of October .
the commen@@ cement of the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of ma@@ kes@@ hi@@ ft boat trips .
since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ strasse in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is resum@@ ed , the traffic situation within the site has eased .
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the passing traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Chief Executive Director Florian King , responsible for the transport management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were many easy ways and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ tic in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not met , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two to three per minute has been sp@@ lash@@ ed .
the fastest was with 77 kilometers per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
since the construction site has been moved , however , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the busin@@ es@@ spe@@ ople at the B 27 it is just a little con@@ sol@@ ation that Rot@@ tenburg is now open to customers from Rot@@ tenburg .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has resulted in sales break@@ through@@ s makes everyone look through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
who has less to do with the end customer , i.e. produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at most slight decline , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also at the deal@@ ership Ma@@ ier , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he ad@@ mits , of course , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running documents are missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily exploited bars are the streets along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard hit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he estimates the sales losses to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street renovation has thrown back its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted otherwise .
instead , President @-@ President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous has been handled .
with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are now less able to pass by because of the complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t drive , it is also beautiful somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his pedi@@ gree comes back to the end of the renovation work .
despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months construction work , which is already brutal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fight against terrorism is constantly scre@@ wed in the name of the fight against terrorism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the latest attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a den@@ unci@@ ation status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the hi@@ rel@@ ing .
all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new safety package .
they do not over@@ look anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also take part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he was in a position to achieve results and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , De Ma@@ izi@@ ère did not have enough time to pass before he presented his conclusions for security in the republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU guidelines on air passenger data and weapons law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère starts a second run for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts out of the German passport with double nationality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance at the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
some of them have in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees targeting the country should first check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of den@@ unci@@ ations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw out their papers to disgu@@ ise their identity .
a lot of it is political and legal .
some also have an unpleasant effect and leaves questions un@@ answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of tolerated , for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says De Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security .
and things that pro@@ found@@ ly employed people could not be cl@@ ung out in election events either .
the inner security has moved enormously .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are election campaigns .
the union and the SPD are therefore increasingly placing themselves in position on the subject of inner security .
in the past few days , the two parties went up high .
only a prot@@ rac@@ ted dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a Bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from the dual nationality .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
from a return from the double @-@ pass , he doesn &apos;t consider anything .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have satisfied the discussion in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to re@@ open it is not expe@@ dient .
and he has constitutional obj@@ ections in a Bur@@ ka ban .
whether its own package at all corners is constitu@@ tionally stable and whether it actually is &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner , has yet to show itself .
there is a lot inside what could worry about stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is currently trying to improve its internal security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first signals caution and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still going to get off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the number of deliveries increases worldwide .
but it does not run in all markets .
in the recall campaign there is vor@@ tex about a term .
Volkswagen launches a restra@@ ined start in the second half of the year .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer continues to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
however , in July the VW brand was weaker particularly in Western Europe and thus again bur@@ dened the overall sales as reported by the company listed in the Da@@ x .
in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year .
in Western Europe alone , China was the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s level .
deliveries in the home market of Germany declined by almost a sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of the market , led the weaker figures out of July , chi@@ ef@@ ly to two sales days less in Europe .
in addition , there have been a purchase reluct@@ ance in some core markets due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also bur@@ dened a spokes@@ woman .
in the US , where the exhaust @-@ gas first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
the Chinese market is a great support for VW .
overall , the main affected house brand of the Nieder@@ sachsen will continue to get off lightly due to the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a minus of 0.@@ 9 percent will be available to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to report sales spl@@ its from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had tam@@ pered with with a software exhaust tests .
in Germany alone , VW creates around 2.5 million cars for retro@@ fitting into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW re@@ affir@@ med that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the car manufacturer claims a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate after retro@@ fitting , but does not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is the reason for j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal refin@@ ements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now provides its German customers with a guarantee for diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA fully . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; stated Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry .
VW has assumed the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after conversion , no deterior@@ ations will take place and all relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it was called in corporate circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen regards the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop for half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in the interests of customers , it is also important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the removal sc@@ andal has resulted in uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was called .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future pen@@ al interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 clients who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savers would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks are storing money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent pen@@ al rate .
the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund asks for this fee from September by private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding 100,000 euros on checking and daily money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 euros in the future will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time , he kept about 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ pays principle , however , the costs continue .
to leave the cash in the bank of the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank is far too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; said the bank cler@@ k .
most customers would have understood and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few went to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy direction causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to bear alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not feasible in the long term . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore raised their bank charges , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land has made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , managing director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay surface charges for deposits , and the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at Lake T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is more luxuri@@ ant than fortune . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
established in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other banks are known at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which calculate a compensation for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken , Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold of going into the negative towards the private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not let themselves be satisfied in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
before you hurry to comment on the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ u@@ it@@ aire men &apos;s middle @-@ aged with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed re@@ development of sound boards is not due to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , who want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects , but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hor@@ den by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers prefer to spend their feelings more for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , a modest gray suit and gra@@ ze wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and something more intimate like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o slowly loses its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there still exists a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I wrote of Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of people : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of people : eight middle @-@ aged men , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3.000 or 4000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60@@ ies , early 70 &apos;s who appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
but he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pipe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually have emp@@ tied their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of adher@@ ents to the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phoenix to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an impetus to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some plate fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers , of objects that recall happy memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of empt@@ iness or property of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I fl@@ atten out a bunch of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of people : three middle @-@ aged males ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revi@@ vals .
&quot; someone just arrived here recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound board so I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ related , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older people who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a colourful audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged teenagers .
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned businesses - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s newest syn@@ thesizer and sex@@ tant pop , instead of experimental jazz ro@@ ars out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks strange but psych@@ ic trau@@ mas are difficult to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale .
it &apos;s more like shopping for a mannequ@@ in than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t earn much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I seem to pick up the jeans hot pants , I watch a group of young te@@ ens who are group@@ ing around pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a cros@@ ley plate player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of records from Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential records for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like boards .
even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they leave , at least in Soh@@ o record stores , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their th@@ ur@@ s@@ day morning with security not by stro@@ lling along Ber@@ wick Street and sheets , while watching the star@@ ring look of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who worries about the shoulders of middle @-@ aged males .
the Greenland shar@@ k is the longest living cycl@@ one - video face
scientific claim that the Greenland shar@@ k has the longest life span of all verteb@@ rates on the planet .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen , who studied sh@@ arks , says that the record was with a female , from which it is assumed that it is between 27@@ 2 and 5@@ 12 years old and five meters long .
French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle refugee camps
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live .
during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to en@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid and that sal@@ v@@ age fire and stability .
humanitarian groups informed the Court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people running the 72 temporary stores , but admitted that the concerns of Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the tear was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated profit@@ ably and provides 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest are eight years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle was increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite the Olympic di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ment : Martin remains fighting
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time , he didn &apos;t want to get Tony Martin down .
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and keep fighting , &quot; said the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before leaving Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he has no explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly say it &apos;s hard to comment on yesterday &apos;s timing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to analyse in peace which causes had led to de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Championship in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also counts my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Olympic : tennis pro wins victories and missed the semi @-@ fin@@ als
the triumph@@ al march of Laura Sie@@ gem@@ und ended in the quarter final of Rio : world ranking lists @-@ 3@@ 2nd from Metz@@ ingen missed by 1 : 6 , 1 : 6 against Mon@@ ica Pu@@ ig ( Puerto Rico / W@@ TA @-@ N@@ r ) .

Sie@@ gem@@ und , who was pla@@ gu@@ ed by back problems , was able to carry out her impact only once and had a strong impact in comparison with previous laps .
on Thursday , An@@ geli@@ que Ker@@ ber ( Kiel / No. 2 ) still had the chance to jump into the circuit .
the Australian Open winner met the British lady Johanna Kon@@ ta ( No. 10 ) .
as the last German tennis player , Tommy Ha@@ as had obtained a medal ( silver ) in Sydney in 2000 .

group increases at start @-@ up for live video game transfers
watching other people playing video games is a huge escape - Microsoft wants to benefit from it too .
the technology group bu@@ ys the Start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft did not share how much money flows for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and has already more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but you can also intervene .
for example , they can give up players missions and confront enemies as well as provide equipment .
Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard starts a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to a global media event , Facebook should help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ up staff , which has previously registered in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moves to the Microsoft Head@@ quarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and boss Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video player department around the X@@ box console .
the Live Stre@@ am@@ ings market is growing rapidly .
popular platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
witch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .
YouTube Gaming is part of the Google mother alpha@@ bet .
here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in various federal states , including in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the Tem@@ plates are particularly effective .
the futur@@ istic enforcement tra@@ ilers of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used in areas of accident , where mobile measurement by the police would be too dangerous .
for example , on highway construction sites or to refurb@@ ishing bridges with temporary tem@@ p , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ under for adher@@ ence to speed limit .
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days in un@@ interrupted measurement operations , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem .
laser measurement technology enables all vehicles to be tra@@ cked at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as access b@@ ans to time , driving stripes and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art , you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with any car with trailer coupling .
in order that it is not simply cl@@ amped , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and , by the way , also snap @-@ resistant outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the heater from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also flash with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ star ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class wins gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 o &apos;clock ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the de@@ odor@@ o stadium .
Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , Side @-@ St@@ epp@@ ing , back , line and raw power to win gold - her first medal of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of this , Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a comfort for the UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , R@@ yan lost each game with the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and dropped G@@ Bs &apos;s attacks from fun .
it felt like captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if you were running into driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au bla@@ sted in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a prot@@ rac@@ ted T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the hill from Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to reach a third goal , but Fi@@ ji stopped it .
in the seventh minute of Ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua one touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the meeting and there was still more than one minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ lied by further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning .
that &apos;s how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes in half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua went through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South se@@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags wave and danced on the platform .
it was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB ki@@ cked down in the law@@ ns .
in the past Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks to the front in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and with it the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the trainer &apos;s cancer for rowing
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ inal gold than in these games and that will mean something .
from the first strokes to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve , who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning discovered an additional significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
the echo of the coach , Robin Williams , was all present when compared to the second Olympic Gold medal in the Second World War , the first women in the history of British sport that set such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9th ou@@ tra@@ geous action , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes gli@@ ding across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph of ge@@ ese .
behind every gold in the rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more accessible than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all , when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is operated and that did .
if you do not do this , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty terrible situation .
it changes a little the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning to talk more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ anning who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility company as a model for the large water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original sound in a post by the Bavarian Radio .
little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia acknowledged the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the Zw@@ eck@@ verband employee , stands for 28 years as managing director .
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water utility company of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , transports approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 towns and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for other towns and communities .
the current Chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed Wasser@@ wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Board of Directors in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they range from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new foun@@ tains ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new foun@@ tains ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of the elevated tanks ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial re@@ plac@@ ements of water pipes .
there have been no stand@@ still and there have always been innovations , because water is meant to be the most important food and drinking water is the most important food .
in her lau@@ dation , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers &apos;s faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he applied himself with much heart @-@ blood for his water @-@ purpose @-@ association and he lived the water @-@ purpose @-@ association virtually as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group to lower the nit@@ rate drop in front of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia water forum .
he received a lot of praise and praise for that .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on his part , praised the Aqu@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best aqu@@ atic and he was a faithful cap .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband .
however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the pipe break@@ age at the high reservoir near Kirch@@ der on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can be maintained once only because one filled the high container of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer of Lau@@ ter who is following the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .
the soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko leaves with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to speak about it . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man called himself with us and stated to have killed his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be punished publicly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
meanwhile , the man is wearing a lat@@ tice .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him , the police .
who looks at Sven S. , is supposed to call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police are talking about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship apparatus . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first , the police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any statements about the operation or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene .
steel - Licht@@ blick for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ laden and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
financial burdens that the industry threatened to promote green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains at the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Con@@ dition for the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; own electricity production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the German steel industry , said German Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent applies .
but even this is not imposed in the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way the status quo of the current regulation is largely as@@ cri@@ bed .
Gabriel &apos;s successful efforts for the steel industry have special significance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others have to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions trading scheme , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation worsen@@ ed when the world &apos;s largest producer of China threw massive steel to the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; European manufacturers cast price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of this spring the situation has eased a little .
on the one hand , import duties imposed on import st@@ alls show effect ; on the other hand , economic prospects in China have increased .
it is unclear how sustainable the price pick @-@ up is .
German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
the aim of Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp was not to exclude the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ ,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the produced amount went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
the association anticip@@ ates an increase in the order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
community , Spirit , Health : sing Do@@ es Sen@@ iors Good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp to her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she occupied the subject of music in the teacher &apos;s school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she describes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good in her health and mind .
since S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German senior league .
most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through the regular interaction , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures arise in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and to organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors are exercising deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly challenge their lungs will not get out of the powder in everyday life as quickly as possible .
singing is an optimal hobby , even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age .
in older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Labour Association of the Sen@@ iors .
in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , it explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ev@@ okes many memories , often associated with positive feelings of her adol@@ escence .
by song lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia can dev@@ ote themselves to long @-@ lying events .
in singing the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
just elderly people who live alone do not just focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
the self @-@ esteem grows through the singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise for a long time , I will be better and more vig@@ il@@ ant than myself - this experience rein@@ forces .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , reveals L@@ enz .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes wrong ?
in search of a suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings out of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can easily join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs of the surrounding area .
those who wish to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leaders directly .
you can also find many senior choirs through the Internet .
those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does good to the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on the scre@@ ams of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the call of k@@ itt@@ ens has on adult animals .
to their surprise , the mi@@ dge also did not let the males cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same .
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens on the ch@@ ew of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to deci@@ du@@ ous k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of kit@@ ten - however always the same .
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not important , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous investigation , the team of researchers has already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams is different with the ur@@ gency of their need for help .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a herd of little ones who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , responded to the cries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned faster to the speaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ator played the very much sof@@ ter k@@ itt@@ ens .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop@@ e with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of women and men to baby noises .
some studies showed that women react more sensi@@ tively to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann spoke .
Po@@ dol@@ ski interfer@@ es with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued in Turkey against the former So@@ ccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football match takes place in Turkey .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not affected by the arrest of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July .
but this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , whom one is responsible for the coup attempt .
in doing so , even before football is not stopped .
against the former strong Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver , the At@@ tor@@ ney General issued an arrest warrant .
according to this , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
he is said to be a suppor@@ ter of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact most Turks have no effect on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared its end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club traditionally are not among the friends of the President . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what unites the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans even agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be again to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Cologne Cathedral proved its sporting value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the Top@@ sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an outstanding way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master took a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Round &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depart early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g , it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who made the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasonal hits as South @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason for the fans to continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
at the time of the coup attempt , the Gom@@ ez , borrow@@ ed and sent to Bes@@ ik@@ tas , had announced after the coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario is willing to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do this , however , the stor@@ mer would have to be willing to for@@ go about a third of his annual salary to 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man stated clearly : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympic Games in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics offen@@ ders can only laugh about it - they are fighting for med@@ als in Rio .
the theme of dop@@ ing continues the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ du@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined about a dop@@ ing barrier shortly before the games , was gra@@ ced mer@@ cil@@ essly on their start ( 100 meters of breast ) mer@@ cil@@ essly .
there was a bizarre scene : with a broken smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when she discovered that she was not going to get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ub@@ el@@ strom .
but there are many other sports@@ men who , despite the dop@@ ing past , go to the Rio Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was banned twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to reti@@ re in 2010 for six months after receiving the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
after having had a strong tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , world champion from 2013 and European championships , has been positively tested for the forbidden stimul@@ ant agent meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic denied the knowledge and was arrested for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and was closed for 21 months .
a means of penis enlargement was responsible , beg@@ ged Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete had recognized as many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his WC title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old had to release Olympic Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the 2006 European title because of testosterone abuse .
he also received the Bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world ranking list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold favor@@ i@@ tin was tested positive until May , but may still start in Rio .
at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references to taking a forbidden dietary supplement were found , the lock of World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran already on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian wounded - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it .
she planned her home journey at the beginning of September .
whether by the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on also Austrian citizens are affected , be unclear for now .
in this regard , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two bla@@ sts went up again , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in det@@ on@@ ation near the beach town of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast were demanding several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to comment on possible motives - but it is probably the act of the Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather , it is assumed that the bombs were put down by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days the authorities have received secret evidence of upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is still unclear which group is sitting behind the attacks .
the police deployed their officials across the country to boost security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely small bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not direct themselves against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
following the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surrounding area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no need to travel to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were held a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs have been an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos while the country moves towards stability , improving economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody uph@@ eav@@ al , is self @-@ sufficient to restore the kingdom to stability and order .
however , it has not been possible for the military to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the far south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
just one year ago in Bangkok , 20 people were killed in a stop on a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Compla@@ int . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after several state offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the federal government have also placed the group under observation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic principles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Court chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ arten of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are bl@@ urred in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group with French roots active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional Prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ arten said his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identical movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; try to pick up their target audience where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extre@@ mi@@ sts in general try to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a solic@@ ited advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda ought to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports on the contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ arten said , he did not have any findings .
possible contacts of this kind are only relevant for constitutional protection from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their target direction and so is extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
with a view to the significant increase in legal crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ arten , in this context , would not yet speak of new right @-@ wing terrorism .
but we have seen in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
it can be quite possible that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks against asylum seekers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .

the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
he expressed concern about the fact that many attacks were on the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
that is the cause of concern .
many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum @-@ shel@@ ters had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to reconci@@ le with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or lef@@ ti@@ sts , who , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympic Games or World Records are not always determining the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia were so slow that he temporarily no longer could be seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
in social networks , Hab@@ ré was subsequently transformed into a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ends up with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and occupied the 5@@ 9th position of 59 starts .
but it was not his very athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why does the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympic Games yet ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to promote swimming in under@@ represented countries .
since most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something different .
preparation is everything : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names made the lap fast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media called him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of the whale . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; following a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only took a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ meter fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming man from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete on his own in a spr@@ int over 100 meters of fre@@ estyle .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and never did such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the lo@@ oming electoral defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
if there is nothing to do with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already been using an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC .
if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
there was more and more opposition within his party .
post goes into trade with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
the Group plans to start trade with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the postal service will also be offering their electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market as of the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been evaluating for months whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to sell to other companies .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always questions about tra@@ des@@ people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn @-@ based company will soon be entering the mass production of vehicles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company is planning the construction of up to 10,000 cars a year and shift .
Ger@@ des announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and make a complete transition to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long run .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the whole fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP management steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uns@@ af@@ e the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Group Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new start .
the boss wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
as of September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , informed the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive Officer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations , the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not want to mention a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
it is still unclear who will lead the market research company in the future .
in investor circles it was said on Friday , in the shareholders , the disappointment on the continued success of the restructuring measures initiated years ago had been great .
since 2011 Mr Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K tip since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholders will be dis@@ qui@@ eted at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this were the case at BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company did not have the opportunity to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at EUR 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent below the same quarter of the previous year &apos;s quarter .
sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros declined by 3.4 percent relative to the first half of the year .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was mainly imp@@ acted by the decline in the value of the company .
the consolidated value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , posted a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million under the balance .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K saw a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - bus sli@@ ps in tren@@ ches in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ ì@@ n : eight injured
in the event of an accident of a travel agent with 43 senior passengers as passengers , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hearing ( county of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , the police arrested .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her data , had to avoid a truck that was partly on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund mentioned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the position of the bus , people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and an emergency doctor came to the scene of the accident at Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the P@@ ew@@ all Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hearing district .
there they should wait for a spare bus from the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic meter waste water amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ fare Strip 3,@@ 44 instead of currently 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( so far 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( so far 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are required .
after a preliminary calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf is at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , during the approval of the budget , Kul@@ mb@@ ach District Office noted that under@@ cover was running for these sewage installations .
due to legal bases the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively .
from 1 October 2016 , the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to step deeper into the pur@@ se bags .
the rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as head of administration Herbert Schmidt showed up to the panel , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , overl@@ app@@ ings or under@@ cover were also to be compensated for the previous calculation period .
Schmidt explained the serious increase in tari@@ ff increases by hand@@ ing up relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste , lying between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic metres per year .
as a result of the small distribution base , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
furthermore , due to the age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , all three plants had fallen into a considerable extent , not least because of their age .
the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the facilities for the feast of the world , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p for almost 20 years .
Schmidt pointed out that in the wastewater system Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be excav@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge removed and an additional ventilation option had to be installed to comply with the water law requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs , which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period , came to these extraordinary expenses . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still well below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully carried out . &quot;
in the past 20 years , Schmidt explained that the market community of large @-@ scale entertainment costs has remained spar@@ ed during the past 20 years .
in the opinion of Stein@@ häuser , the situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater utility association can not be expanded by these facilities because it is a deficit facility .
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 was -@@ 0.2 % compared to July 2015 .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; different goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
the prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
the prices remained as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; flats , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races .
with its filtering tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be a picture of a Roy Licht@@ enstein .
the filters are bl@@ un@@ tly , self @-@ rotating tools that produce more than 30 million more sel@@ fies per day .
all the mistakes come to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have been critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app black@@ face conveying or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when there was a filter by some users this week , which gave them mud @-@ eyes , false teeth and abandoned che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced it would have disabled the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hur@@ ting c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , wrote in an e @-@ mail , whose tweet about the photos were widely spread that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mil@@ dly said unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the confrontation of a very reluct@@ ant Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face has been dra@@ gged into the degra@@ ding extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tri@@ but@@ ary .
the American culture seems to be ent@@ angled in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things stay un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and called on others to do the same .
in an essay on the media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the configuration practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the majority of white , only male leaders and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the chin@@ ese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu , in turn , said she will be closed to her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military Guide Ad@@ ver@@ ts IS@@ IS Intelligence Information , Con@@ clu@@ des Con@@ gres@@ sional Committee
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it had allowed the actual conditions on the ground , an inquiry committee of the Congress announced in a report on Thursday .
the P@@ rel@@ im@@ inary Report created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the comb@@ at@@ ant committees , secret service committees and the defense budget report , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command secret service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , in short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information that was typically enjoyed by high @-@ level Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders regularly posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it permitted the actual conditions on site and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the management errors in the Cent@@ Com range from the top to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct indication that governments have given orders under Obama to alter the reports , it shows how analysts looked at pressure from their predec@@ essors , a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ sul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , a Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command peaks changed the intelligence reports to down@@ play the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is underway through the Ministry of Defense &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday , which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years of 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; stated the high @-@ ranking Dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , such as Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; denoun@@ ced the moral under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no clu@@ es to a White House intervention at Cent@@ Com analysts in terms of a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the General In@@ spec@@ tor was still underway .
but he also stated that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have counter@@ acted the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the divisions of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush mis@@ understood only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker according to government officials stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his dispro@@ portion@@ ately positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA won fourth match in the field of women &apos;s hockey , show@@ down with the UK
one day after they shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Fiel@@ d@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their goals in mind .
but they know this : the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each .
the first placed will leave the strong Dut@@ ch@@ man a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , American women have caused a surprising swi@@ vel by their success story , four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and for the first time with three years had a hockey ra@@ cket in his hands ( her two older sisters played sports at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team , began to turn things better .
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am .
we didn &apos;t have the work around London that we now have .
we got the ru@@ dder being able to s@@ nat@@ ch around completely .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the door ri@@ vals in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash from the close range .
India had gone into play without a victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the level from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flan@@ k , then moved to the centre and put the ball in the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
in the heart of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games .
the events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and in@@ escap@@ ably , a swift e@@ as@@ el between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod which is handed down from the cross@@ bow to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes .
you cannot turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time , set up by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gym@@ na@@ sts , or even fen@@ cers .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the olymp@@ ic gymnas@@ tics tournament .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
further from the centre , some in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted : air gun shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
but if I should have enough arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline .
although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have already been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years saw that many people I surv@@ eyed did not know that it was an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the United States sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had an athlete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans who are for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ lown &apos;s school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a earth@@ bound enthusiasm .
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ istic trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the span@@ ish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up @-@ and @-@ coming winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to design , difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ als in their pursuit of gold must go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but also a further increased goal in tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission : that of the world or the Olympic Committee .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is pos@@ h , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it is enough to even touch a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it is also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ed when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing space .
the v@@ ector of the tramp@@ ol@@ ines is above .
a forward motion is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down@@ wards , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly up again .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant repe@@ al of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13 : 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final round as part of an afternoon block from 2@@ pm on both days .
in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ie they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and obj@@ ectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. gym@@ na@@ sts suggested recently - Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base according to air .
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the US
violent protests in Ethiopia
prot@@ esters calling for political changes in Ethiopia came across the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that during the clas@@ hes with the police , ump@@ teen prot@@ esters were killed .
is Ethiopia close together ?
in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West , with a rapidly growing economy .
but in the last months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was ruth@@ less .
witnesses stated that police fired and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now asking for a detailed investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager for the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is Africa &apos;s most popul@@ ous country in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a remarkable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba &apos;s capital .
the roads are generally quiet , safe and clean .
even though Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , and dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or sent to prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the stran@@ gle@@ hold in relation to power of the governing coalition .
after a far @-@ si@@ ghted election last year , the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time the tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea are rising ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , con@@ ten@@ tious line demanded hundreds of lives in June .
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ ga@@ den , which have been defeated more or less in recent years , could exploit the turbul@@ ence and re@@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are now explo@@ ding after years of prior year &apos;s birth under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
it was only in recent years that many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government closes the access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave it to the protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ per@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons of time , the Am@@ per@@ as who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands prosp@@ ered in politics and business while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ per@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for about 6 per cent of the population , dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think around corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in seeing early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively opa@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il was in 2005 after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , apparently fu@@ elled by the government according to analysts and subsequently stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed even if they were less than in the last months , and this time of un@@ rest continued relatively quickly .
R &amp; D experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but apparently this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ mis@@ e of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month protests in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ sian city , run by Tig@@ ray and hate against the Tig@@ ray become more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests swept the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this basis .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin atro@@ city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings his comrades who make an effort to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to explain statements he could not have meant at all .
after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump retired with respect to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ ets were contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling up@@ turn figures .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
he compla@@ ined about Twitter that Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he felt strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s emails , but he explained later , &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then back up as needed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to what the reaction turns out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even more plau@@ sible tone , as his demand has gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist published on Friday showed a major lead in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics of distor@@ ting his statements or mis@@ understanding his humour .
but while he is increasingly focusing his attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s thu@@ gs have put his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s most prominent interc@@ essors , took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Clinton Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that ahead of Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called it back@@ bit@@ ers , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread through it by subj@@ ecting the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around and being bi@@ ased against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
once crowded into the market , cafe in Green@@ point returns
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sk@@ id@@ able Cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash that didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were ou@@ sted .
soap Cher@@ ie &apos;s business , which was sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
locals tou@@ red it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ aker wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel is apart and verb is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it is also new invention .
a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simpl@@ istic atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started to work at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new exterior , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
the menu includes sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ishes such as cap@@ ers and s@@ aut@@ é@@ ed onions .
there are natural r@@ ink keys .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also pushed out by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived earlier in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the Ver@@ b on a regular basis .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the verb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; closed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she gave up the coffee drinking , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was at the coffee and culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth quarter after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he will change his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he didn &apos;t have a gru@@ dge about the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owner of the soap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in the coffee shop as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we &apos;ll respond to her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional , Polish inhabitants of Green@@ points have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preten@@ ded to exhibit them so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice shop wants to fill and sell cold bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighbouring building .
for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed on the ground than the café closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing breakdown of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a delic@@ acy , President Roosev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined fi@@ dd@@ esses of Fi@@ fth Avenue , such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tor@@ to@@ ise soup .
its menu on that day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Bri@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book , &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey , &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the United States , while Ziegel@@ man in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; talked about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side .
her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine in the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which is already in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the re@@ porter ordered roast beef , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich food was very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male Fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked p@@ â@@ té for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways in which the country avoided being no longer the land of milk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ e committed , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food like bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients from a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a seldom served luxury .
strange mix@@ tures have been tried out , as a high @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has prim@@ acy over taste or even common sense .
while resear@@ ching the book , which includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish of this era , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular additive at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
as never before or since , econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - under@@ took the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become household politicians and to meet the challenge of turning pamp@@ as like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty .
while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ aire man of the world to which he became .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and carried a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to give an example to his stomach .
as described in the book , the manager of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosev@@ elt said the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting prepared . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food have been disc@@ arded as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Ziegel@@ man said , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Ziegel@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick was remembered , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the fall of the wind .
after the dishes were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , which President Roosev@@ elt consumed at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to send a modest name to humble recipes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone showed a te@@ as@@ po@@ on in the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ bers a little reluct@@ antly .
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E took a second stop three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in a bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save lives from others .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil prot@@ ector , who showed him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , according to the image : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die , I think God is a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters dropped four barrel bombs across the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous remains of the bomb so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture rec@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland H@@ arks usually come to the surface only in winter .
after an investigation on the ship of S@@ anna , this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a well over 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland H@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is average just 1,@@ 220 metres far .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent remedy for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ eck of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist believed for a long time that Greenland shar@@ k become st@@ ony .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland H@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hairs .
they measured their slow motion as they fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the polar sea and seek cad@@ a@@ vers that tor@@ ped@@ o from higher water layers .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland H@@ arks , who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins they contain will not be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
as a consequence , their birth should lie in the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons recru@@ it large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
with 220 centimet@@ res of third @-@ smallest animal , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons tests , so in its investigation in 2012 it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday .
in their lens nucle@@ us , all larger Greenland shar@@ k , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cm @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k might be 3@@ 92 years old at 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers .
that Greenland shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland shar@@ k with the reproduction obviously allows for at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such meth@@ y@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , in whose bacon at the neck a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip stuck , was caught before Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame .
they later mature - and age slower .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very big .
the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than at one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ eck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , a very big animal should invest his resources rather in a long life .
building site in double pack
the Municipal Council has mainly focused on issues relating to construction in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the panel resum@@ ed the announcement by mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of newly designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after clari@@ fying the property , plot and development issues and the applications for sur@@ veying , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the cultivation areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau are intended to appeal to young families and other sen@@ iors in equal measure .
as it was said , volunteers can report to the town hall from now on . the municipal council is expected to advise on the allocation of the plots in its September meeting .
in order to meet even requests for the establishment of other commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the council decided to change the land use plan created only in the spring of this year in sub @-@ sections .
in the Lower @-@ Time Area , the industrial estate that has already been declared there will be extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the City of the Main has the best opportunities to attract new jobs and companies from London .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and Real Estate Markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether banks should continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been granted approval in the UK .
this is particularly the case for large US banks .
several banks have already announced to reloc@@ ate jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs at the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision by the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European supervisory review E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Committee ES@@ R@@ B .
while in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxemburg , though , conce@@ des a large fund industry , but as well as Dublin , it is worse when it comes to infrastructure .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve .
further points are the city with commercially available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than on the Main .
moreover , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure and less crime .
in a ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city was ranked 7th , Luxemburg in place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ W concludes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , which econom@@ ists mean .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector in London , and in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent law@@ suit with Mer@@ ck
a US court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a refund of the legal expenses incurred by the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ t C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June Gilead was freed of a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs called so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after an US judge discovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical conduct .
when the complaint was raised on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the cost of the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equi@@ p Gilead with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck su@@ ed each other and claim ownership of laboratory work which included Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j of the Islamic State
supported by the United States , full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city left these , said a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the withdrawal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently fighting the city .
they have liberated over 2,000 civilians being held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan told Dar@@ wish the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently running clean @-@ up operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s income 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million for the Democrats and their husband , and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former president Bill Clinton generated almost USD 5.@@ 3 million in Rede@@ mp@@ or@@ ariums ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Sen@@ ator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , has published his tax statements for the past ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards for financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement .
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ts with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax statements .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not obliged to do so by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit for their refusal by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regards to the publication of the democr@@ ats &apos; presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Spezial@@ couns@@ ellor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not finished .
Tr@@ ump Cri@@ tics , among others also the Republi@@ can Pres@@ idential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other links , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already top@@ pled on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump calls on his tax return to be published .
on Thursday , she also addressed the issue during a speech to the Mich@@ ig@@ an economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what each other presidential candidate has done over the last decades and publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would make sure people pay more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has its headquarters , called Tr@@ ump to a meeting to exchange their tax declarations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax test of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; afraid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has returned tax return by 2007 .
the Clinton Foundation , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 , and an effective combined tax rate of around 40@@ ,5 % .
Clinton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that they only obtained USD 100 of their income as a salary , unlike most Americans .
their main investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund that tax@@ ed the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and revenues of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ es , fire@@ works support dance ani@@ as Ele@@ fan@@ ten@@ schutz
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Foundation , which had the idea several years ago , intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
previously , many wood@@ p@@ eck@@ ers used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World Phone Day , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ Guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include illumin@@ ating the elephant with a torch and blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chim@@ ey wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the city council , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new building of a sales ski on the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ isch@@ kom@@ s building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in an exposed position on the Rhine bank this ki@@ osk will not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director strikes at Berlin &apos;s hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; challenge - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots captiv@@ ated a media watch@@ man after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ selection as Arab guests had &quot; requested &quot; according to an employee .
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the hotel &apos;s country selection list .
however , the country was not listed in the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
written by Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers a possibility to select Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of management of Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the pre @-@ election be er@@ ased , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed from this event .
that is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has taken place in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet where people called it a sc@@ andal .
some of them under@@ lined the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; re@@ aped the alleged aff@@ or@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel reported . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not include Israel into the quick selection list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
add that the country code has been added now .
police uses tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police introduced tear gas and rubber missi@@ les against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police used rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the governor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo , Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are being converted to save money .
some of the prot@@ esters saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts spra@@ ying against the temporary pres@@ idents Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went on the streets in crowds to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who was dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran rises suddenly to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trading volume between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador with .
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trading volume between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 , compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the commercial recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes to Russia for a record number of Iranian tourists this year .
last year , the Russian embassy issued around 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year broke , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I personally would recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , which have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y attack on Thursday evening was carried out on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ der Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the presence of a fire@@ arm , three dark@@ ly clothed people , who had hu@@ gged their faces , drew cash from the beverage market cler@@ k and then whis@@ pered at first on foot and then probably with a silver coloured VW Golf .
the police do not share how much money was captured .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters , thus relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and badly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the assault , the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be fle@@ dged from the ball@@ ast @-@ parking space located opposite the car @-@ house entrance with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should report urgently to the police .

in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the St. Anna High @-@ Minist@@ erial Round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the dioc@@ ese of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered by the gates of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the chambers of Hei@@ ligen@@ z made their way .
in the evening , the pastor sent out the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrims &apos; cross and shared the pilgrimage .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ en@@ ster of Un@@ told loved Woman stands and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s way from Münster was started .
each day and evening the individual day tours were accompanied by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches repeatedly made a break to sing together a song from a specially made pilgri@@ m song .
for overnight stays the parish offices of the local par@@ ishes were available .
at the stages Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller cared for a delicious and star@@ ving dinner and breakfast .
we continued on the second day about Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at first we had to relax at a mu@@ ggy heat about 500 metres altitude .
the earned reward was a barbecue at the end of the day in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to Freiburg on the final stage .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy the Min@@ is met in the later afternoon at the Freiburg Min@@ ster and passed through the gates of mercy .
with a little impulse , God was thank@@ ed here .
the Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed at the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service the pilgrims could visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day there was still time for the metropolis .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner sun@@ k last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in the velo@@ drome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anch@@ or@@ age that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made to E@@ igen . the J@@ er was proud of the legend when he stor@@ med home to ha@@ sten a victory from New Zealand &apos;s favor@@ ites .
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after losing only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in March , despite the Ho@@ ys re@@ appearance .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in good time as a reminder .
Mr Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago sealed with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner prevailed in qualifying laps as an Olympic record , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders conquered in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
behind it was almost back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team for@@ wards and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and fell in Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an olymp@@ ic battle in the final round and defeated the world champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way of winning this .
after the triumph in 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys site , Hin@@ der realized that after a weak start he fell deliberately on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the platform like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the shape Kenn@@ ys it &apos;s in the range of the possibility that he won Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would mean Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same for Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four mile race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , which won Gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday , he was cont@@ ested with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height .
Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie to the world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio were shut down .
drama plays out in the background , such as the res@@ ignation of technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of Sex@@ is@@ mus@@ - and M@@ ob@@ b@@ ing@@ vor@@ ossi@@ ps as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks quite like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its climax at the perfect moment , will be repeated again .
future of the Mel@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the cancellation of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company communicated .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a 20 @-@ year subsi@@ dy exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effect as the melt consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa concluded the Point Henry Mel@@ ting , which led to a closing of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting pot of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses cash and risks closure .
this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by enam@@ el , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; hed@@ ging transactions , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 .
contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L income from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual subscription rate of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of cancellation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate sm@@ el@@ ting or supply the electricity to the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; did not compromise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation of why it has res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions in the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts each year to generate around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity .
if both plants would disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan , Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador for Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a craw@@ ling reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n as well as in the presence of the most popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ Un@@ cle and Produc@@ er of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) , which ends with a classic twist : all of them have planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é deed of almost every episode episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave her other girls in this publicity somehow .
with a view to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has started .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim loves her as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that resembles more of an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracted a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pages of advertising from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years images of the magazine had tran@@ se@@ ded before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who mo@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls below the previous category , she finds herself in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with her reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers has always been a little ten@@ se in the fashion world .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed &quot; the pieces of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were again boiling high when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but going around on the grave seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells images produced by C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine &quot; LOVE . &quot;
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
congreg@@ ational centres assign 160@@ ,000 people a year
more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary services are ann@@ ul@@ led annually by the community centers while the industry insi@@ sts on the impact of further mi@@ dd@@ le@@ ties on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ vings and the like - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further reductions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the community centers of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community centres revealed that thousands of people are already rejected every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse if the Federal Government &apos;s decision was lifted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
in June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funding by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of people in need from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Bundes@@ jus@@ tiz@@ ministerium and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift these short @-@ cuts so that people can get the help they need to get legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign accused after workers allegedly drew arms
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a fire@@ arm on one employee in February while travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ord@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ordin@@ i stated to have been waiting for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dra@@ gged a gun , laid his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and took the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i gave in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compla@@ ining about the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ord@@ i determined that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he announced in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he gave ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indi@@ ct@@ ment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate dissolved a ri@@ ot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and arms bud@@ dies - should take action if his rival was to appoint H@@ illary Clinton and appoint judges .
tr@@ umps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of duty of care and Philip because of bodily injury and permanent mental damage .
s@@ ling@@ backs Press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to reach an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip were also out of place .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) there are notable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties .
this resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the poll@@ s in Berlin .
but the SPD is the strongest party in both states and would have a good chance of continuing to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD collap@@ sed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could return to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be at 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated at 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) to the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag .
the N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent .
according to the survey , the SPD of the survey reported only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
they were thus still la@@ gging behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but on the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , by contrast , the pirates would not miss the entrance in 2011 .
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : the Nokia Communic@@ ator came on the market 20 years ago .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his maker experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good at hand .
on the contrary , it was rather cl@@ ums@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies at high resolution .
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros fans can buy the equipment even on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age .
twenty years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ ent@@ ander format office &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could have a lot for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax , the communic@@ ator could be reached .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browsers , albeit slow .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , which is about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
no one could sense in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the Smartphone @-@ era .
since then everything has changed .
smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and wound to Microsoft .
today &apos;s market leaders dominate the market all a lot later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is today for very many people everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
some 1.4 billion devices were sold in Samsung and Apple alone 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running stores of countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone .
the key breakthrough on the mass market came at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator to easily use everything by touch screen .
the success of Apple has started , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look .
they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ ws now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must steer the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we will already have 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expanding He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ ant on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ unders were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in am@@ i@@ able growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment in both the airport and the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most popular cat@@ walks in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third run@@ way , supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olymp@@ ian spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking
for companies that earn money with online advertising according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; cross and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display spots on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect signs indicating which part of the page advertisement is .
but Ad@@ block announced that it found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams said that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her fight between the time @-@ consuming open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of indicator lights , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has embark@@ ed on the fight is a strong indication of how alar@@ ming display block@@ ers have become the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display loos@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion users active on Facebook over their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of the advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks .
the company said that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large share of revenue , making Facebook the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control of their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying , because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool , which is why we instead focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people .
woman with presum@@ ed suicide over@@ ride on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police call on witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday witnessed a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was convic@@ ted of several vehicles , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been questioned , but some have not yet been identified , the police said that this and every witness of the incident told him to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation process was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes shared court c@@ ousin to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - in which a person was running in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having passed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and on the street became unconscious , took the court .
the Court found that the police -- who had responded to an emergency call -- turned to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Air mam@@ od@@ ell : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once impose similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and turned slowly .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to house life and protect from fast evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the daylight aspect of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that is similar to evolution , previously thought by planet explor@@ ers .
although once presumably inhab@@ itable , Venus had been exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over several billions years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ our was burned away from the ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen@@ ates , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide has remained with a le@@ thal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy res@@ ig@@ ns as a train@@ ee of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and contributed to the decision @-@ making process of the team .
as an alternative president / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , that it needs and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organisation .
he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on May 23 , 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has been honored as the best trainer of the league with the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award .
he led the club to 112 points and in the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the late season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ en and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
northern ship@@ builders resume talks , put on strike
the labour struggles with regard to wages for North Sea workers are suspended while all the conflic@@ ting parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators .
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of resolution of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will stop a few full @-@ day meetings within the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said their last strike , the first in more than 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates of its contractors in North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market recovery .
shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ union with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has intensified by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish Parliament committee Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star pile to different rates , and in which context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planet formation .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our findings with other star names , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years away from the earth .
many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ thood .
they are turning the fastest now .
at peak rot@@ ations , these po@@ ign@@ ant stars rep@@ el large amounts of star @-@ winds .
since these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a slow@@ ing effect on the stars .
when a star climbs , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star fle@@ cks -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more solid stars are turning slower than massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars slower pace than smaller ones .
&quot; in the &quot; ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; Reb@@ ull said .
since the star cluster of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rotation rates .
&quot; the stern@@ um of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , both younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow@@ ed their rotary rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotary rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial Bas@@ eball star
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional return announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m saying goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has been giving him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will be acting as advisor and youth coach in the future - with a full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid the money back for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two other bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be included in the bas@@ eball hall in the bas@@ eball hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave birth to bi@@ dden ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis Sc@@ andal , he was blocked for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to have been the prime suspect for years to have been awarded by an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida .
after a legal dispute , the ban was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for 2014 , because I have played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said swe@@ eter at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell @-@ days also do not run sil@@ ently .
while many bas@@ eball legend reaches the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was often forced to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez who was married to act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the circumstances with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , got the sympath@@ ies of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e Arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the fans at 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team .
Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : due to a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski is not allowed to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
an educated athlete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases became known for Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre barrier runner from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - right before the start of the already critically challenged Ath@@ le@@ tics competitions , these news come to an end .
the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been proven in Ch@@ en last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final more than 100 m of butterfly , just 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze medal .
on Friday Ch@@ en would have participated in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) has requested the opening of the B sample and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news perme@@ ated the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old himself went on the offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation might be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , EP@@ O is supposed to act as an EP@@ O dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ec@@ owa has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v received criticism of the bul@@ letin right away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation must not take part in Rio .
on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier .
both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of athletes , especially the fall of Dan@@ ec@@ owa is another heavy blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Trade Organisation ( IA@@ AF ) banned the entire Russian crew except for systematic dop@@ ing , but also the nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in the swimming sport , the previous clubs in China also caused severe disputes between the athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; Sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a discussion with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun had a positive effect on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ ac@@ ia in Chinese nationals , but had to leave only a three @-@ month ban .
data Blue : so hack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting firms - and are successful in doing so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a recent survey by malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the companies surv@@ eyed in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the fees demanded by the perpetr@@ ators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
according to the reports of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes the perpetr@@ ators are speci@@ alizing in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be rede@@ emed is significantly higher than for private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently witn@@ essing a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes boss Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred in recent months start@@ ling swiftly .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for un@@ altered files like Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
to get the end turn code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
but where private users find the personal photo database at stake , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production still stands .
accordingly , the damage is higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits .
22 percent of German companies reported lost revenue due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to stop doing business altogether . in one case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in view of a stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they tell their victims via chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t example files free of charge .
and if private individuals are saved after payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to bar@@ gain partially and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers are becoming increasingly professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus supplier Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail .
the previous malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ ids then seek further hack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
thus , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment will be made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with the spread , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey hope to be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful kill@@ ings , the perpetr@@ ators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before .
in future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things to the grain .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the release of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have a lot of space in the front row and rear seats .
the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit falls slightly .
more versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 l with folded back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and offer storage space that is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling .
the trunk is well loaded , but the 650 mm loading height is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot in 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , his work is likely to be somewhat qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is enjoyable .
there is another engine line : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
but steering should be a bit more direct .

airline not liable : down@@ fall on a passenger &apos;s bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s bridge .
the Higher Regional Court in Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) ar@@ gues that liability is conceivable only in cases that are typical of air transport .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee injury during the fall .
the accident , however , could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline didn &apos;t have to pay compensation for the man .
disease case : when does the Organ@@ izer pay ?
sick leave will only get money after their trip if the cause of the illness is doub@@ t@@ lessly found in the hotel .
this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests are shown to show the same symptoms .
in the case in which case a family suffered from diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease caused the tourists to return to a defective treatment plant contaminated by sea water .
the family believed that the trip was insufficient - and compla@@ ined against the organizer .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
in fact , the treatment plant was in fact defective .
however , the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the verdict .
especially since no contamination has been found in water samples .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violent crimes committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must react calm@@ ly and decisi@@ vely at the same time to acts of terror .
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and split .
we will not treat this triumph to terrorists .
if perpetr@@ ators need to leave the country more quickly , this will increase security and strengthen the agreement of the people for refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personal strengthening of security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit magnitude more than several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism should be punished again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ce@@ ase@@ fire will be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is more difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recently much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère s words .
however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession on how to reduce the threat of citizens , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities .
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , De Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior was clearly opposed to action .
&quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sha@@ w@@ lers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union after a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of the double nationality .
as a general prohibition of full wear , it is considered problematic for constitutional law .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about street traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of plot@@ ting crime power and ability to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a sharpen@@ ing of the right of stay bring the people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the right to turn the right is to be renewed .
this is good news for all the drivers who are standing in traffic every night in traffic on the surrounding road if they drive over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction works on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Road and the Wes@@ er Straße exit the right lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Road to the right .
the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des early , which improves the overall production sequence on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Mu@@ en@@ ster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage goes up to the bridge across the Alber@@ go path and sometimes beyond .
reason is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ er Straße .
from here traffic is driven only one lane on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back just over three @-@ quarters of years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load @-@ bearing capacity , in order to record in particular the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
the responsible state company cannot say how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected daily traffic will last .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining duration until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal bi@@ dding route , the state enterprise deliberately chose the weaker time during the school holidays , because with disabilities it is to be expected .
traffic will be continued on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Journey : cultural Off@@ ers for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school attended the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the organisation N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of &quot; Inter@@ cultural Tour , &quot; initiated by the organisation N@@ ima &apos;s , 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the small house .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of youth with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster through this project .
most of the youngsters in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among other things , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and spoke little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it would have been possible for them to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theatre Münster .
the N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , teenagers with and without refugee and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Trip &quot; continues .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement in weather
the weather has made a stroke through the bill in the south @-@ west of Germany in the south @-@ west of Germany - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the sky spectacle , said the Chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope is on the night on Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometres per hour .
they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips for S@@ leep Dis@@ orders
in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning it is not enough to think about sleep well before the alarm bells .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleep problems or sleeping problems manifest themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind it , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Research and S@@ leep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being is the in@@ som@@ nia , thus an inhal@@ ation and diar@@ rhe@@ a .
many people just feel sleep@@ y as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Dental Association with practice in Var@@ el Lower Saxony .
what lies behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines .
the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is often an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking is frequent in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , if you have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , you can sleep well , wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , I shoot an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , advises br@@ oth .
the draw@@ back can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly any medical exam@@ iner in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
for this reason one should first contact the primary doctor in case of sleeping problems , advises br@@ oth .
research can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep or what happens ?
for example , for the examination in the sleep laboratory , doctors suggest snor@@ ing with breathing agents , in case of path@@ ological day@@ time sleep@@ iness , sleeping trans@@ duc@@ ers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ adding , one goes to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler on the finger .
in addition , a camera is placed on the ceiling of the sleeping person .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sit for a better sleep .
I shoot at : regular bed@@ time and stand @-@ up times , do not sleep too long in bed , do not watch TV for falling asleep , abst@@ ain from alcohol and don &apos;t look at the clock at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve to .
what the jungle camp with missing med@@ als in swimming has to offer
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ sel@@ er expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olympic is .
in December 2014 , he took gold at the Short @-@ Way World Championships in Doh@@ a for the first time and at the same time presented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ sel@@ en has protected himself against his ex @-@ team@@ mates who stand in criticism via Facebook .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets a € 20,000 bonus and a jungle of 150@@ ,000 € , no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in the swimming pool is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not exactly see or even practice dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not saying that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ tem@@ bler should have reported to Germany ( NA@@ DA ) nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS of independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; asks the election ham@@ burger who meanwhile runs an ice cream par@@ lor .
airport : bunch of luggage sealed
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
the police of the Düsseldorf police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
as a band , the susp@@ ects committed several bags of bags and baggage .
at 9 : 30 pm , civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to polic@@ emen from past rob@@ ber markets .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of ju@@ ly of this year and had been involved in a professional , professional and professional manner .
the Speci@@ alists of the Criminal Inves@@ tigation Department 34 can demonstrate four deeds to the eves who have been travelling to Germany for off@@ ences .
in doing so , they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few streams of lime , between now and a rest of the cob@@ ble@@ stone streets : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like at first glance , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one goes along the road from east to west , one passes play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades .
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it will be built : by 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be favor@@ ed in recent weeks , however , with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin interior sen@@ ator has repeatedly advoc@@ ated a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence .
after clearing the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ets s@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rol official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
in the meantime , construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers left the rank of sympath@@ isers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents are walking with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late night .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who raised three children here , is generally irrit@@ ated by the police presence .
they share the concerns of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication with the inhabitants of the house projects .
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z , who demanded majority police protection from v@@ and@@ alism lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin sen@@ ator and the police put up between occup@@ iers and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class district , which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
also house occup@@ ations and the living projects born there@@ from belong to the neighbourhood for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the whole Mainz street very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and ball@@ ads from around the world in recent years : residents from East Germany and former occup@@ ants are now sharing their neighborhood with them .
this is also reflected in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are being attacked as symbols for this development : they recognize them at disc@@ arded disks or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which have been disc@@ arded with colour bags .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words of &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
one reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily offen@@ ded by crimin@@ ality : criminal off@@ ences such as body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against police officers .
most of the crimes are attributed to property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a house near the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
when it comes to violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ less : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been .
even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Riga Zoo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the architect , her street is not a criminal hot@@ spot , on the contrary : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
this is why it was so important for her to get back the road : from the police , the politics and the media , who in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be removed : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former constructions that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums which are not interesting for many - people who are not so well cared for , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what do you do if you never listen to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
for newcom@@ ers who are angry with color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belong to the Kie@@ z .
who pul@@ ls you should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub area , can complain badly there about noise .

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commissioned
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugee aid , administration , authorities and those who are otherwise involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the uns@@ ett@@ led wo@@ ol@@ ly @-@ sau , who above all has a problem .
thus some - less ridi@@ culous but rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work .
yet administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports hon@@ our@@ able and full @-@ time actors .
there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
there will soon be new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
you have to put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations have to bear the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the administrative office of the municipality to the municipality and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto the administration does not find private apartments .
until now , it does not work , if one is dependent on private apartments , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be not@@ orious , as it is so beautiful .
new containers will soon be placed in the washing line .
but it has not been done with apartments .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pers for refugees and migrants that need to be rounded or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house master , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that working for the community will result in a positive external effect .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but action doesn &apos;t just mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , says Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so I need offers such as sports , contacts with local people and above all language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so administration and volunteers also jump in here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate .
the clear majority was motivated .
but there are also problems , says customer sincer@@ ely , &quot; People who don &apos;t work at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : are the two after the most recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small church like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine client says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but a residual risk cannot and may not exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these incidents are also a topic among the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would completely dis@@ credit them .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers will have to look for activities locally and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants can come to Ur@@ bach soon .
does Germany need a cap ?
politics is hes@@ it@@ ant to answer this question clearly .
it is actually unfair to place them on site .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet reached where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the original people are already busy integrating the people so far .
currently , these are around 100 people , mainly young men .
but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated there are no simple answers .
