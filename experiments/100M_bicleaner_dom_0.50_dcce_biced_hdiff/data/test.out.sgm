<seg id="2">His experiences on horseback are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues was looking for a little change with a ride on the beach.</seg>

<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">Saturday was Germany's best golfer ever - 101 tournament victories - once again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He was able to lead his family through the system of the ALRV, he couldn't even swear to a horse for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen in the framework of a small gala the Golden Sports Pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of honors to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silberne laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the Queen of England has already rebuked him.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump Economic Policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential candidates are not one of the tax and energy policies, as well as in a fundamental issue.</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamental, rather philosophical.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, on the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton hopes to tax the economy and regulate his death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively retract regulators, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has opportunities to open up disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it.</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes for the rich would increase, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the future, Trump and Clinton said almost verbally.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has announced the greatest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical tea party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">There may be party internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and retract coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, intends to explicitly extend and demand renewables with its investment programme: "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the trans-fugal trade agreement, both do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time both, however, do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, Clinton asks.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a starvation.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must be drunk, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics are keeping it, making the budget deficit worse.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who at least demand from the rich wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "Alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight months "long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish counterplayer in the gilded Hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny myself that Ankara would most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile worked narrowly and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan once again spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report all five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but could even be improved.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten anything.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was aroused.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen into the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the cousy becomes difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months the state-controlled media launched a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations from senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria's areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "finally, this meeting was held only because Putin received the excuse he wanted to hear from President Erdogan." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after having relieved almost his office last month with a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television projected cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Veghsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West, as it regards its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the continued grudge about the sluggish pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that he called for support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">For Moscow, this is clearly a matter of course, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this splendid palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as an analyst once described to portray an "alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel abandoned and treated badly by the West and are now allied.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched on the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey intentionally avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey dropped the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state talk at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of the tightest confidence of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for Evironmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a deputy to Ivanovs since 2012, has been appointed his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital city of Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later became the director of the Protocol and Chief of Staff of the Governor.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your work as Head of State on bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked him to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidante and works like him for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff resigns on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who once was touted as a potential president should at once want to lead Russian environmental policy - stumbled upon great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated job - you could almost say - to entrust the complainant for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov one of five people whom he trusted the most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president again three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="1">Fifth Crossing: bridge now connected with Fife</seg>
<seg id="2">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensland crossings with the viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected with fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four sealings of the" "" "ceiling blowers" "" "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bevel ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The project is expected to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queenset crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of truly epic dimensions in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">All in all, almost 79% of the deck's entire deck and the last section of the deck got a dongation for the deck today in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said:" "" "the first closure is a significant milestone in every bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of forward-looking construction and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the North Tower, we had to close the existing gaps on the north or the land side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern bridge crane bridge 700 millimetres to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive yet very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at a slope of about 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate as the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.</seg>
<seg id="20">Fortunately everything went very well.</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: in the future investors should be much more obliged to do so.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one react to the bad news that in the next few years, Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 affordable housing?</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "living concept" "" "for the next session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But strife is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "SPD leader Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if anyone wants to build on urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments must be rejected as social housing in the future." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The cheap apartments can, however, also arise in stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">However, the major issue in the town hall is, "said Bratmann:" how do we deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas but as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new urban housing development programme that will cost millions and still be financed is to provide incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to impose tougher jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, Bratmann said, a tightening of the situation on the housing market is taking place.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the building administration.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should already be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of some 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire in the coming years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to the budgetary spokeswoman Nicole Palm, now borrow bonds should be bought from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought about bringing apartments back to price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">The problem could be solved at one stroke.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Weststadt, Fristen is running at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be picked up there in price binding for affordable apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing corporations.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "because the number of social housing in the western city is drastically increased, the aim of the so-called" "" "mixing" "" "is removed." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke writes:" "" "for a vast majority, the CDU must go into the boat." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.</seg>
<seg id="35">What does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">The fact that teenagers and children don't go outside for playing, but rather prefer to spend their free time sitting on screens has been mourned by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about bringing people off the sofa and letting them become more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games, and last but not least on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course I refer to the Pokémon go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created first for the video games in the 1990s (later emerged from it a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand was falling in the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed due to the massive demand the servers were overloading.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go out with their smartphones and look for Pokemon that can be traced with a GPS and, once found, "fotographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the US, the game has led to a considerable rise in steps that the" "" "average" "" "person puts back every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardio, an app for Apple Watch, who followed up to 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people, who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it merely looks the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "" "met deaf ears because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderfull thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that is fun for them.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also mural players who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it about?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will decrease over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="1">Simone Biles creates gold in women's urns</seg>
<seg id="2">Forget the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="3">Forget the hype.</seg>
<seg id="4">Simone Bilit is immune to all this.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dynamic on the jumping horse.</seg>
<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Breath taking on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliantly brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast reached the competition title on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team camera Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American women of Simone Bilit turnes on the floating bar during the single multi-day campaign of women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Bilit is the fourth heterosexual Americanwoman who wins multiple competition titles and in total the fifth while she consolidates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her end result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Bilit has dominated the sport over the past three years, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected a final test in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bilit and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, on the left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi-camp inale of women at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Bila won the first medal on Tuesday, while she served as exclamation mark at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although she insisted on having never planned the future for her long path, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - including their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainee Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gym, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013 she hasn't lost any competition, a winning streak that will last as long as she wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Although Mustafina slightly led through two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Briefs and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got back again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and with a 15,933 on the floor still took one on it.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently as she expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears flowed on biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection-book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time the 22-year-old team of men, which is called "grandma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After their ground training, she threw Kussharks back to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which at times seemed doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As far as Bilal is concerned, the rapidly expanding tweet of the 19-year-olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first serial killer of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and heard music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand firearm while he was standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently escaped with another vehicle, is read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police reported that the threefold murder did not seem to be the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesperson of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting encouraged the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">A total of seven people were killed in hispanic living quarters within four months, and two others were injured.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it is happening in a residential area in front of a house," "" "told Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on site.</seg>
<seg id="13">One witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting that crashed onto an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Violent rainfalls, flooding gives rise to bailout in Louisiana, Mississippi</seg>
<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to call on the emergency booth on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the southeast of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi River flooded their shores and threatened with widespread flooding following extreme rainfalls, the National Weather Service reported.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already underway to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, announced that the requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand bags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone would have requested ten thousand sandbags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used over large parts in the south of Louisiana until Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain.</seg>
<seg id="9">A flood early warning system was deployed in the south of Alabama on Friday while it was still raining in the Mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comite near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers can flood many homes in the nearby baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a flood-directed flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers are only slowly flowing down into Lake Maurepas via the rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi State border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.00.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still beheaded people from the flood water in the districts of Amite and Wilkinson in the Southwest of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were rescued near Globe on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which is normally located more than 400 feet from his house, increase dramatically over night.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said that another stepson who lives nearby would have warned him.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water was streaming and pouring in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife said that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.</seg>
<seg id="21">He and his family members said he would have all the obstacles and he would be the only one who can swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were accommodated until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flood had" "" "spread rapidly" "" "as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities would consider evacuation operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer reported in the proximity of Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the rain has been considerably watered by rainfall since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities indicated that heavy rainfalls and flooding floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and Lesson in five boroughs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a subsidiary in Tangipahoa took over 200 flood-flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated into two churches, both of which were now flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The leader of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed up by floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the towns of Amite and Hammond emergency shelters were set up to house evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "as soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa nearly two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags provided for the inhabitants who hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "the last major flood we had was in March," "" "said Lacy Landrum from the municipal administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy told Harrison Countys that it rained on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his information, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as inundated, but on Friday they have not been reported until now.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amman, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I present to me under the Women's Olympic Championship in the Turnen and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First of all, I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And secondly: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who had an inspiring effect on many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, the catholic is round off, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic champion and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they provided unexpected yet masterful gynastic routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual american who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but so do gymnastic classes in the whole country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to get it to the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four female gymnasts in the team. moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics, maintained by parents for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these sports clubs are located in affluent suburbs, which can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to offer to the municipalities of countless young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easy-to-reach exercise training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gym of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable touristy in Harlem for over 15,000 urban young people (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the young high-quality gymnast that will make it possible to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It's the crew's inspiration for thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team gold and thank you so many young girls with backgrounds seeking to start their way, healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="13">Last year, a Special Administrative Court decided that the acting mayor Luton Rahman was to be relieved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry after a litany.</seg>

<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn your robber around the skewer.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "if you get closer to you from behind, then you should turn first, so that you can see your aggressor and" "" "go out of the shot line," "" "says Mizrachi." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat it then with the knee in the groin and twist while the attacker bends up against pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards while they direct the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the case of attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it, so that the attacker can't shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time, put weight on the weapon and strike the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and straightening the weapon on it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright abbot for a guide his tongue in the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller withdrew his immune system and prophylactic of a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk turned his train on a euro note, a banker at Piccadilly Circus, a purge button of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dropping each object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get into.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment that was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to lick the rinse button of a towing toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria and about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left him, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known for testing the resistance of his bowel by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public places at stations to flush dumpling of toilets, the task was definitely put under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film, he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test painting showed a luminance number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminance number of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to lick after her luminance was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands show one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I've germinated in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick anything here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "valios Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried out crazy brainstorming, which ended in saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the movie shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had ordered him to lick, just like the eclectic Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others, in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associate lactic acid bacteria especially with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products that contain added lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delogiance with a damage of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocking employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had ripening holes, wooden beams were piled up, garbage was spread on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she now lives in a private apartment</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who worked for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment could no longer be repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people and I think people don't have to live in this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this property is believed to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is as well.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had caused, street fights with baseball bat, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, strife and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that may be torn down under certain circumstances, old trash was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the property in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn down</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and had to call police on a regular basis</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delimited her and her partner forcibly this week from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiance was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "one said," "" "They didn't bother anyone." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have abused the family to cooperate with the local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, 20 years long.</seg>
<seg id="26">Garbage and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the church building</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he added:" "" "it is a shame that the tenants voted to accept any responsibility for their behavior and their family, as a delogiance is always the final step of considering Cornwall Housing." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delosion on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g cannabis as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon received a fine after having found himself guilty of owning a class B drug in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After being homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graffiti with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police said they will delegate tenants who do not abide by the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">The police of Devon and Cornwall informed Angela Crow that the delogiance was a clear warning to the other tenants unable to abide by the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach as well as to those who have been harmed by such behaviour," "" "she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia cannot vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, they have understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "2021 will not resume the country's election directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">Because stupid as yet it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and country elections - that bites.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be persuaded by the campaign fighters, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not locals, so they are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays volunteers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count votes in the end only work hard to apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4th September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass an election campaign short of the people over itself once more.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, head of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting how much newbie AfD will cut off and what remains at the end of the coalition programme.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years of age and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chases a little with the people, just as his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise, Seering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the thriving of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "their refugee policy, you" "" "We create this" "" "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its leading candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is if you make an election campaign at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice been invited to German chancellor Angela Merkel. Merkel's parliamentary election is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony then as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "accused Vincent Kokert, general secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in the NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the North-East CDU largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions at market locations and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "that means coking, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">The Union has also noted that on the country you have to brush up the base, that it has to work very hard to find a wire to people again.</seg>
<seg id="26">It goes like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any one in the sides of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "the Council of the CDU elector Kokert is self-exposing:" "" "you must go where it hurts, namely where the people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, any birthday party must be used." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has called its SPD to a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In surveys, the Socialists and Democrats were lagging 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In the election of 2011, the SPD had still clearly won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are expected to make the leap into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the need of a holiday and transfer their election campaign largely to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online campaign" "" "is the name of the regional president, Claudia Müller." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8pm, there is everywhere praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they made everything quite jagged," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">The commencement of the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift boat trips.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstrasse in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg is resumed, the traffic situation within the site has eased.</seg>

<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because there were many easy ways and more familiar with their Navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were frantic in residential areas.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved, however, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businesspeople at the B 27 it is just a little consolation that Rottenburg is now open to customers from Rottenburg.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has resulted in sales breakthroughs makes everyone look through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Who has less to do with the end customer, i.e. produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants were" "" "hard hit" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="33">"" "street renovation has thrown back its operation" "" "for two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President-President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant benefits otherwise from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, family business has been here since 1715, pointing to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are now less able to pass by because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it is also beautiful somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his pedigree comes back to the end of the renovation work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crisis with BSE and bird flu Göhner keeps the effects of B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="18">He still believes this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chance at the coalition partner anyway.</seg>

<seg id="24">Some also have an unpleasant effect and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of tolerated, for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says De Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">In addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security.</seg>

<seg id="2">Despite diesel scandals, the number of deliveries increases worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="3">But it does not run in all markets.</seg>

<seg id="6">Despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's biggest car manufacturer continues to show a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, in July the VW brand was weaker particularly in Western Europe and thus again burdened the overall sales as reported by the company listed in the Dax.</seg>
<seg id="8">In July with 449100 cars worldwide, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, China was the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's level.</seg>
<seg id="10">Deliveries in the home market of Germany declined by almost a sixth.</seg>
<seg id="11">Jürgen Stackmann, head of the market, led the weaker figures out of July, chiefly to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, there have been a purchase reluctance in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions."</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote on the exit from the EU also burdened a spokeswoman.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, where the exhaust-gas first escalated, a minus is also available.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Chinese market is a great support for VW.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the main affected house brand of the Niedersachsen will continue to get off lightly due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a minus of 0.9 percent will be available to 3.37 million vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to report sales splits from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had tampered with with a software exhaust tests.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW creates around 2.5 million cars for retrofitting into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting VW reaffirmed that the conversion of cars did not have any negative effects.</seg>

<seg id="4">If banks are storing money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penal rate.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Raiffeisenbank Gmund asks for this fee from September by private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding 100,000 euros on checking and daily money accounts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before you hurry to comment on the pseudonym non-alluitaire men's middle-aged with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the much discussed redevelopment of sound boards is not due to a boom in millennials, who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horden by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers prefer to spend their feelings more for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, a modest gray suit and graze wildly before I stop, hold my hands and something more intimate like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho slowly loses its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there still exists a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I wrote of Sister Ray (Number of people: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of people: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60ies, early 70's who appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">But he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pipe, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually have emptied their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of adherents to the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It only takes a few seconds in a shop like Phoenix to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some plate fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, of objects that recall happy memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the colt of emptiness or property of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have a record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very concerned as I flatten out a bunch of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of people: three middle-aged males), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revivals.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just arrived here recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound board so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-related, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say," "" "I don't have a record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a colourful audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged teenagers.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned businesses - Wild Beasts's newest synthesizer and sextant pop, instead of experimental jazz roars out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks strange but psychic traumas are difficult to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It's more like shopping for a mannequin than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't earn much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to hear music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of fans: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I seem to pick up the jeans hot pants, I watch a group of young teens who are grouping around polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter decide to buy a crosley plate player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records from Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items like boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov agree, they leave, at least in Soho record stores, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their thursday morning with security not by strolling along Berwick Street and sheets, while watching the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who worries about the shoulders of middle-aged males.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energydrinks, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Calais prefecture argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy, out of which no taxes would be paid and that salvage fire and stability.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups informed the Court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 temporary stores, but admitted that the concerns of Calais prefecture were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who" "" "live in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the tear was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated profitably and provides 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids "Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that closing" "" "would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest are eight years old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle was increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7 o'clock rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of fijis when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 in the deodoro stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji shared a master class in handling, Side-Stepping, back, line and raw power to win gold - her first medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a comfort for the UK - but it probably won't - that at least a Brite tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss of England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost each game with the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and dropped GBs's attacks from fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt like captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if you were running into driving busses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau blasted in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right-hand corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A protracted Tackle from Mitchell stopped the hill from Sierra Leone Nakarawa to reach a third goal, but Fiji stopped it.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute of Athlete jasa Veremalua one touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the meeting and there was still more than one minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou complied by further weak tacklings of the UK team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes in half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua went through Tuisova after a brilliant interim play by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South seeinsulans, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the platform.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not hard to admire the playful approach of Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounds, the Fijis hugged and GB kicked down in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the past Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Great Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-finals match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks to the front in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and with it the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by fighting with the trainer's cancer for rowing</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first strokes to the last, 220 hard pieve, who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning discovered an additional significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">The echo of the coach, Robin Williams, was all present when compared to the second Olympic Gold medal in the Second World War, the first women in the history of British sport that set such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th outrageous action, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph of geese.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more accessible than the coach who did not know about 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all, when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operated and that did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do this, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty terrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps were enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wrecking morning to talk more than usual and thus tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "Stanning who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan said," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning lost no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "Helen called" "" "stay in the process, stay in the process." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="3">"" "the association is regarded as" "" "Bavarian far exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water utility company as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">So it was some time ago in the original sound in a post by the Bavarian Radio.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia acknowledged the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein Group is" "" "exemplary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Zweckverband employee, stands for 28 years as managing director.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was now retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water utility company of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, transports approximately 150,000 cubic metres of water per year and supplies 32 towns and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for other towns and communities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current Chairman, Breitbrunner Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW) recalled that Rupert Göller was appointed Wasserwart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Board of Directors in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they range from water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency interventions at weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountains (1994), land purchases in the area of the new fountains (1998) and compensation of farmers, the refurbishment of the elevated tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial replacements of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There have been no standstill and there have always been innovations, because water is meant to be the most important food and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudation, she praised Göllers's faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He applied himself with much heart-blood for his water-purpose-association and he lived the water-purpose-association virtually as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein group to lower the nitrate drop in front of the Lower Franconia water forum.</seg>
<seg id="20">He received a lot of praise and praise for that.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on his part, praised the Aquwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best aquatic and he was a faithful cap.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the Zweckverband.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the biggest challenge and the most difficult operation were the pipe breakage at the high reservoir near Kirchder on a third of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can be maintained once only because one filled the high container of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer of Lauter who is following the succession of Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-laden and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared from additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that the industry threatened to promote green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it remains at the release of the Renewable Energy Condition for the so-called" "" "own electricity production" "" "in the German steel industry, said German Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday edition)." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask the steel producers to use the gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this is not imposed in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation." ""</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened when the world's largest producer of China threw massive steel to the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "European manufacturers cast price dumping in Chinese steel companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring the situation has eased a little.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, import duties imposed on import stalls show effect; on the other hand, economic prospects in China have increased.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price pick-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">The aim of ThyssenKrupp was not to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 8,000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers are cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the produced amount went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">The association anticipates an increase in the order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, Health: sing Does Seniors Good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp to her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she occupied the subject of music in the teacher's school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "sing moves me - emotionally and physically," "" "she describes." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good in her health and mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since Singen is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German senior league.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through the regular interaction, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures arise in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and to organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors are exercising deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly challenge their lungs will not get out of the powder in everyday life as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">Singing is an optimal hobby, even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age.</seg>
<seg id="15">In older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Labour Association of the Seniors.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, joint singing had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, it explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people evokes many memories, often associated with positive feelings of her adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">By song lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia can devote themselves to long-lying events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just elderly people who live alone do not just focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition experienced by singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise for a long time, I will be better and more vigilant than myself - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Anyone who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, reveals Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of a suitable offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings out of the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can easily join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs of the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who wish to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the church leaders directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">You can also find many senior choirs through the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good to the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="10">Here is an overview:</seg>
<seg id="11">Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100-m-relay / USA): the 34-year-old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.</seg>
<seg id="12">He was banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 until 2010).</seg>
<seg id="13">Since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex-World Champion is even faster than before, he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.80 seconds and is regarded as the biggest challenger of Usain Bolt.</seg>

<seg id="5">Whether by the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon also Austrian citizens are affected, be unclear for now.</seg>
<seg id="6">In this regard, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, so Schnöll.</seg>

<seg id="8">According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two blasts went up again, and another person was killed according to the authorities.</seg>

<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist rebellion or with international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are required.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a preliminary calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf is at 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, during the approval of the budget, Kulmbach District Office noted that undercover was running for these sewage installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases the market of Kasendorf is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to step deeper into the purse bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">The rate increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As head of administration Herbert Schmidt showed up to the panel, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overlappings or undercover were also to be compensated for the previous calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious increase in tariff increases by handing up relatively small facilities with a very low waste of waste, lying between 6800 and 12000 cubic metres per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the small distribution base, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a grave impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to the age of refurbishment and repair expenses, all three plants had fallen into a considerable extent, not least because of their age.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the facilities for the feast of the world, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp for almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the wastewater system Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">After almost 20 years of operation the first sewage sludge had to be excavated, the sewage sludge removed and an additional ventilation option had to be installed to comply with the water law requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "the ongoing maintenance and maintenance costs, which are to be taken into account in the new calculation period, came to these extraordinary expenses."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants, the expenditures for the operation and maintenance were "fully carried out."</seg>
<seg id="20">In the past 20 years, Schmidt explained that the market community of large-scale entertainment costs has remained spared during the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the opinion of Steinhäuser, the situation for the aforementioned facilities will continue to be precarious, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility association can not be expanded by these facilities because it is a deficit facility.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as Asian caricature criticised</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filtering tool, Snapchat allows some 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be a picture of a Roy Lichtenstein.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are bluntly, self-rotating tools that produce more than 30 million more selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All the mistakes come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app blackface conveying or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When there was a filter by some users this week, which gave them mud-eyes, false teeth and abandoned cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced it would have disabled the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of hurting clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student, wrote in an e-mail, whose tweet about the photos were widely spread that the filter was "hurtful and mildly said unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the confrontation of a very reluctant Asian caricature and filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellowish, but that the yellow face has been dragged into the degrading extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tributary.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be entangled in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters a picture that is insulting for a user, "it is much more difficult that such things stay unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and called on others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay on the media and in a telephone interview she said that she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the configuration practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the majority of white, only male leaders and ended their essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either I have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company publishes no numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a personnel officer focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu, in turn, said she will be closed to her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="4">The Central Command, in short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information that was typically enjoyed by high-level Centcom commanders regularly posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as it permitted the actual conditions on site and were generally more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article quoted the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the CentCom range from the top to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct indication that governments have given orders under Obama to alter the reports, it shows how analysts looked at pressure from their predecessors, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, a Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command peaks changed the intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after being admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is underway through the Ministry of Defense's General Inspector.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years of 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," stated the high-ranking Demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, such as Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "denounced the moral under analysts and" "" "gave too little room for dissenting opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no clues to a White House intervention at CentCom analysts in terms of a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector, who received complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the General Inspector was still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">But he also stated that "experts sometimes have diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have counteracted the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (a claim that is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, last year's accusations have raised the question to what extent President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of the divisions of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush misunderstood only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker according to government officials stated that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his disproportionately positive assessment of the situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retiring in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after they shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American Fieldhockeyteam of women in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">But they know this: the American women are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons on the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will win the first and second place each.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will leave the strong Dutchman a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, American women have caused a surprising swivel by their success story, four years after they landed in the last of 12 places at the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time with three years had a hockey racket in his hands (her two older sisters played sports at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the National Team, began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam.</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the work around London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We got the rudder being able to snatch around completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the door rivals in the first half of the game with a backlash from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had gone into play without a victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the level from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flank, then moved to the centre and put the ball in the gate to give the American female a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">In the heart of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constantly and inescapably, a swift easel between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod which is handed down from the crossbow to the swimmer to the turner for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time, set up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmers, gymnasts, or even fencers.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the olympic gymnastics tournament.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shade are the sports which are not generally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I should have enough arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampolines have already been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years saw that many people I surveyed did not know that it was an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines and had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians are inclined to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who are for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown's school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a earthbound enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonistic trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite them.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Up-and-coming winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to hit a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to design, difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medals in their pursuit of gold must go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but also a further increased goal in televised transmission: that of the world or the Olympic Committee.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is posh, admirable, even fanatical - and it is enough to even touch a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel fatigued when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing space.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampolines is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward motion is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downwards, then effortlessly up again.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant repeal of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13: 00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final round as part of an afternoon block from 2pm on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympia-Manie they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and objectivity of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts suggested recently - Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base according to air.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the US</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia came across the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that during the clashes with the police, umpteen protesters were killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia close together?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police fired and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now asking for a detailed investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager for the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is Africa's most populous country in Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a remarkable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in Addis Abeba's capital.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are generally quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even though Ethiopia was anything but an example for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, and dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or sent to prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to the stranglehold in relation to power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a far-sighted election last year, the ruling party and its allies have received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions along the border to Eritrea are rising; a struggle for this jagged, contentious line demanded hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which have been defeated more or less in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding after years of prior year's birth under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was only in recent years that many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government closes the access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave it to the protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amperas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amperas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons of time, the Amperas who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands prospered in politics and business while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are going to coordinate under a screen," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amperas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia illegally is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for about 6 per cent of the population, dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death in 2012 for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in seeing early signs of discontent and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil was in 2005 after thousands were protesting against elections, apparently fuelled by the government according to analysts and subsequently stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed even if they were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest continued relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">R & D experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this did not prevent the intensification of the internal demise of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protests in Gondar, an ampersian city, run by Tigray and hate against the Tigray become more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests swept the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this basis.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeatedly repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republican Presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his comrades who make an effort to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to explain statements he could not have meant at all.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump retired with respect to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to imply that the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweets were contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Trump, while he tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling upturn figures.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">He complained about Twitter that Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he felt strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Clinton's emails, but he explained later, "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then back up as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans as they arrive, and then" "" "clarify" "" "according to what the reaction turns out." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has assumed an even more plausible tone, as his demand has gone further." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist published on Friday showed a major lead in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is increasingly focusing his attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's thugs have put his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumpet's most prominent intercessors, took great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked for the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Clinton Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that ahead of Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called it backbiters, completely wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread through it by subjecting the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around and being biased against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apology as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="1">Once crowded into the market, cafe in Greenpoint returns</seg>
<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a skidable Cafe in Williamsburg, where you could pay only cash that didn't have Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue shop front were ousted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie's business, which was sold in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Locals toured it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabaker wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is apart and verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simplistic atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started to work at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new exterior, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, retained a lot.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for the bagels purchased the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">The menu includes sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rink keys.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also pushed out by prizes from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived earlier in Williamsburg and visited the Verb on a regular basis.</seg>

<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his accession to the President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a delicacy, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined fiddesses of Fifth Avenue, such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water tortoise soup.</seg>

<seg id="8">Coes's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman in her book "97 Orchard" talked about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side.</seg>
<seg id="9">Her latest collaboration, "A decent meal," which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine in the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small snack in the Flatiron District, which is already in store since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olives, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>

<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a seldom served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures have been tried out, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction has primacy over taste or even common sense.</seg>

<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and carried a tuxedo.</seg>

<seg id="41">As described in the book, the manager of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Mrs. Roosevelt said the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most comforting prepared. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression to deal with food have been discarded as soon as the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland Harks usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">After an investigation on the ship of Sanna, this shark was allowed to return to the sea.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a well over 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland Harks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is average just 1,220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a patent remedy for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen of the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "insanity," "" "said Alexander Scheuereck of the Max-Planck-Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the evolutionary biologist believed for a long time that Greenland shark become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland Harks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hairs.</seg>
<seg id="17">They measured their slow motion as they fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the polar sea and seek cadavers that torpedo from higher water layers.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland Harks, who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins they contain will not be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">As a consequence, their birth should lie in the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons recruit large quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">With 220 centimetres of third-smallest animal, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so in its investigation in 2012 it should have celebrated its 50th birthday.</seg>
<seg id="27">In their lens nucleus, all larger Greenland shark, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 watch showed an age of 335 years for a 493 cm-long Greenland shark, while the record shark might be 392 years old at 502 centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark-females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland shark with the reproduction obviously allows for at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methyalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120-year-old harpoon tip stuck, was caught before Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame.</seg>
<seg id="36">They later mature - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very big.</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much greater than at one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives therefore more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," "" "explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuereck." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very big animal should invest his resources rather in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French director with Jewish roots captivated a media watchman after betraying that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre-selection as Arab guests had "requested" according to an employee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentation "Shoah," made his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>
<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country selection list.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed in the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "the Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a" "" "great disgrace," "" "reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">We were horrified and dismayed from this event.</seg>

<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to" "" "draw the right conclusions," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a pretty big resonance on the internet where people called it a scandal.</seg>

<seg id="22">"" "" "" "ashamed," "" "it was said in another article, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is near a synagogue." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The registrants from the pastoral care unit Eyeial Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four stages were tackled.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all the registrants in two years, the St. Anna High-Ministerial Round has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations have been examined and finally decided for the diocese of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered by the gates of mercy at the Freiburg cathedral.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the chambers of Heiligenz made their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening, the pastor sent out the pilgrims at a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrims' cross and shared the pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Muenster of Untold loved Woman stands and so the pilgrim's way from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each day and evening the individual day tours were accompanied by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches repeatedly made a break to sing together a song from a specially made pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">For overnight stays the parish offices of the local parishes were available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stages Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller cared for a delicious and starving dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">We continued on the second day about Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting stretch of road, but at first we had to relax at a muggy heat about 500 metres altitude.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a barbecue at the end of the day in the evening.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner sunk last night in the men's team sprint in the velodrome in Rio to fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchorage that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. the Jer was proud of the legend when he stormed home to hasten a victory from New Zealand's favorites.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after losing only a modest sixth place at the London Underground World Championships in March, despite the Hoys reappearance.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in good time as a reminder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Mr Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - four years ago sealed with Hoy - and Skinner prevailed in qualifying laps as an Olympic record, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders conquered in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Behind it was almost back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forwards and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking place in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and fell in Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic battle in the final round and defeated the world champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way of winning this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys site, Hinder realized that after a weak start he fell deliberately on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no objection to England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels like all the UK flags on the platform like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've gotten so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven out of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the shape Kennys it's in the range of the possibility that he won Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same for Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I just enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four mile race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won Gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday, he was contested with officials before the qualification when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">Laura Despite, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie to the world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Drama plays out in the background, such as the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of Sexismus- and Mobbingvorossips as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks quite like the now legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its climax at the perfect moment, will be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company communicated.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A 20-year subsidy expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effect as the melt consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa concluded the Point Henry Melting, which led to a closing of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting pot of Alcoa in Portland loses cash and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting plant with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by enamel," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">AGL continued to say that the contracts were called "hedging transactions," which should have entered into force in November 2016.</seg>
<seg id="15">Contracts have a 12-month period of notice, so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "from this point, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the fiscal year 17," "" "said the current supplier." ""</seg>

<seg id="18">"" "AGL announced that the value of the contracts had already been written down in its annual subscription rate of $187 million in" "" "anticipation of cancellation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" "" "Alcoas" "" "ability to operate smelting or supply the electricity to the melt" "" "did not compromise." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions in the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">In reference to analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts each year to generate around 900 megawatts of electricity.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "Kendall wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping up with the Kardashians similar?), a crawling reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn as well as in the presence of the most popular Showbiz-Uncle and Producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), which ends with a classic twist: all of them have planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché deed of almost every episode episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to leave her other girls in this publicity somehow.</seg>
<seg id="7">With a view to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has started.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim loves her as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that resembles more of an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracted a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were 615 pages of advertising from the 832 pages of the tome).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is expected so eagerly that in the last two years images of the magazine had transeded before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there were clearly more" "" "celebrities who mom" "" "as" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize-winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls below the previous category, she finds herself in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who sign up in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV history, Jenners has always been a little tense in the fashion world.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized "the pieces of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were again boiling high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But going around on the grave seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">They and all their sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells images produced by Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine "LOVE."</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) there are notable losses for the SPD and CDU government parties.</seg>
<seg id="3">This resulted in representative surveys conducted by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north, this is not possible after the polls in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the SPD is the strongest party in both states and would have a good chance of continuing to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD collapsed from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could return to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would be at 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">Despite slight losses, the Greens hesitated at 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent) to the Schwerin Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="11">The NPD and FDP would not be represented in the Landtag with 3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the survey, the SPD of the survey reported only 23 percent (2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">They were thus still lagging behind the Greens at 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but on the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Deputies.</seg>

<seg id="2">For companies that earn money with online advertising according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to circumvent ad blocking, a "cross and mouse game."</seg>
<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display spots on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network.</seg>
<seg id="4">On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding for its advertisements to make it difficult to detect signs indicating which part of the page advertisement is.</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">In a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams said that "this kind of Hin-and-Her fight between the time-consuming open source community and the bypassing has been underway since the invention of indicator lights," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once impose similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and turned slowly.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house life and protect from fast evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus is exposed to the daylight aspect of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures, which are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that is similar to evolution, previously thought by planet explorers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although once presumably inhabitable, Venus had been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burned away from the ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogenates, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide has remained with a lethal greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know it today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star pile to different rates, and in which context the rotational periods are associated with planet formation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our findings with other star names, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Centre in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star-run of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years away from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this star cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are turning the fastest now.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak rotations, these poignant stars repel large amounts of star-winds.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since these winds travel through the stars of the stars, they have a slowing effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star climbs, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star flecks -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more solid stars are turning slower than massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars slower pace than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the" ballet "of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the star cluster of the Pleyades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities like rotation rates.</seg>

<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">An educated athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases became known for Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre barrier runner from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were positively tested and ruled out in Brazil - right before the start of the already critically challenged Athletics competitions, these news come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">The diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been proven in Chen last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data Blue: so hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting firms - and are successful in doing so." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the fees demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the reports of Malwarebytes the perpetrators are specializing in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be redeemed is significantly higher than for private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently witnessing a startling rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes boss Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">First of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred in recent months startling swiftly.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for unaltered files like Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the end turn code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users find the personal photo database at stake, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production still stands.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware hits.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of German companies reported lost revenue due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to stop doing business altogether. in one case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of a standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers, in turn, know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers from F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They tell their victims via chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, free accessible support websites or decrypt example files free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private individuals are saved after payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to bargain partially and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, hackers are becoming increasingly professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus supplier Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The previous malware kits have been created by purchasing the malware, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included in delivery is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmaids then seek further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">Thus, one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment will be made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals employ spammers with the spread," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey hope to be able to repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful killings, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This means that the potential for damage, depending on the type of data, is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In future, the perpetrators could also take completely new goals on the internet of things to the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how to control a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the release of such a blocked heater may well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivans.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually turns out to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have a lot of space in the front row and rear seats.</seg>
<seg id="6">The interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the upper side of the cockpit falls slightly.</seg>
<seg id="7">More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR-V in the storage space.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk is well loaded, but the 650 mm loading height is slightly higher than in the comparable Peugeot in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, his work is likely to be somewhat quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is enjoyable.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine line: a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">One of the security systems is the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision-warner sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote-light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control reacts to the road sign detection and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI connector lie beneath the armrest and are therefore a bit awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">Some 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are all right.</seg>
<seg id="26">If you don't want to invest so much, you will get the gasoline engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel is 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing Night: tips for Sleep Disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning it is not enough to think about sleep well before the alarm bells.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeping problems manifest themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind it, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being is the insomnia, thus an inhalation and diarrhea.</seg>
<seg id="8">Many people just feel sleepy as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Dental Association with practice in Varel Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What lies behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines.</seg>
<seg id="12">The sleep disturbance is often an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking is frequent in a depression," "" "says Weeß." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can sleep well, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to pondering about everyday problems and worries, I shoot an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises broth.</seg>
<seg id="19">The drawback can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or even medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any medical examiner in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical centre at the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason one should first contact the primary doctor in case of sleeping problems, advises broth.</seg>
<seg id="24">Research can clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep or what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, for the examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors suggest snoring with breathing agents, in case of pathological daytime sleepiness, sleeping transducers or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After cladding, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera is placed on the ceiling of the sleeping person.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">I shoot at: regular bedtime and stand-up times, do not sleep too long in bed, do not watch TV for falling asleep, abstain from alcohol and don't look at the clock at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive to.</seg>

<seg id="3">The police of the Düsseldorf police managed the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">As a band, the suspects committed several bags of bags and baggage.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9: 30 pm, civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to policemen from past robber markets.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of july of this year and had been involved in a professional, professional and professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Specialists of the Criminal Investigation Department 34 can demonstrate four deeds to the eves who have been travelling to Germany for offences.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few streams of lime, between now and a rest of the cobblestone streets: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like at first glance, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one goes along the road from east to west, one passes playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a biolades.</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it will be built: by 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy district" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be favored in recent weeks, however, with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin interior senator has repeatedly advocated a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as a "no-go zone" for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After clearing the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadets smiths, with 300 police officers, the police patrol official statements for three weeks with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the meantime, construction workers renovated the premises on behalf of the unknown house owners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers left the rank of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents are walking with children, people sitting on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late night.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who raised three children here, is generally irritated by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the concerns of rising rents and gentrification with the inhabitants of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez, who demanded majority police protection from vandalism leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin senator and the police put up between occupiers and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class district, which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the living projects born therefrom belong to the neighbourhood for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the whole Mainz street very close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and ballads from around the world in recent years: residents from East Germany and former occupants are now sharing their neighborhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also reflected in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are being attacked as symbols for this development: they recognize them at discarded disks or freshly painted facades, which have been discarded with colour bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words of "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason for not all neighbours to regard this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily offended by criminality: criminal offences such as body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against police officers.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the crimes are attributed to property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a house near the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">When it comes to violence, it is weightless: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Riga Zoo.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "for the architect, her street is not a criminal hotspot, on the contrary:" "" "here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was so important for her to get back the road: from the police, the politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty over the district.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be removed: by faceless new buildings in former constructions that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums which are not interesting for many - people who are not so well cared for," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what do you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">For newcomers who are angry with color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belong to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who pulls you should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub area, can complain badly there about noise.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioned</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration around Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugee aid, administration, authorities and those who are otherwise involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is now there, the unsettled woolly-sau, who above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less ridiculous but rather targeted on the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative staff with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work.</seg>
<seg id="10">Yet administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honourable and full-time actors.</seg>
<seg id="15">There are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">There will soon be new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">Municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You have to put the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations have to bear the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the administrative office of the municipality to the municipality and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">Until now, it does not work, if one is dependent on private apartments, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be notorious, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it has not been done with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and helpers for refugees and migrants that need to be rounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "reports Regine customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house master, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community will result in a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But action doesn't just mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, says Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I need offers such as sports, contacts with local people and above all language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So administration and volunteers also jump in here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">Anyone who at some point develops the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach can't work and be useless, he will never integrate.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problems, says customer sincerely, "People who don't work at all." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: are the two after the most recent occurrences fear of radicalization, even in a small church like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine client says quite clearly," "" "what some may call naïve." "" "but a residual risk cannot and may not exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "these incidents are also a topic among the refugees." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would completely discredit them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers will have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new blow to refugees and migrants can come to Urbach soon.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">Politics is hesitant to answer this question clearly.</seg>
<seg id="59">It is actually unfair to place them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet reached where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the original people are already busy integrating the people so far.</seg>
<seg id="63">Currently, these are around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated there are no simple answers.</seg>
