Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
it is also intended to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution being discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing housing development and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated further .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress held a controversial speech that was part of an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election forthcoming in Israel at the time .
in an emergency call professor , who has shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb had told him that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was still alive and probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inside the house the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ b@@ ble on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot; this was signed by the authorities in the letter and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular historian , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that all university staff have heard shooting at 10 : 18 .
he said that at some point Lamb had made the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
a day after shooting at the university , forcing students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty incorporates 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs Spur later , when he came back to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before being arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &apos; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car was running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he did a doc@@ torate in the spring of pedago@@ gy .
one of the long @-@ time friends of Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through common friends .
she and her friends were in high school and he was the cool elderly guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
he was the s@@ warm of women at that time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ air@@ ston said , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously spending some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb had been interested in music and played the blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail went both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter is writing and singing her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on September 5th for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmony play in front of a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , conducted the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
around 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the watch station , while the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; were sung .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are trying to return our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police are now saying that Lamb opened the emergency room after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox S@@ j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realise that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and a length of arms away from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; was premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only exac@@ erb@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UN chief again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution .
Ban said to a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - the United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of meeting the Council of Ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s down@@ wards , it still hasn &apos;t worked .
ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump to lead in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
none says Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize tr@@ umps and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l in a positive way .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 would say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand 47 percent of the repub@@ li@@ can voters say that they were &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see a m@@ umps of temp@@ er as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number applies in the country &apos;s first selection state , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temp@@ er does not fit into the White House , says ABC / Post .
repub@@ li@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they raise their money @-@ money @-@ hats , repub@@ li@@ can voters keep a pump for real .
if they are asked who will most likely win GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week , four out of ten say Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four from ten end of July started their money at J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the final cycle , four out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final Candi@@ date Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it appears that a variety of GO@@ P voters can view the campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is still beating almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field will probably contribute to tr@@ umps , while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is diff@@ used to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before the margin Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans say that they have formed their minds .
a recent C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support tr@@ ump say they have firmly rejected their votes .
of course , much has happened to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nevertheless , tr@@ umps is strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his election campaign two months ago , the immig@@ rant population was turned revol@@ t and pi@@ vot@@ al in the public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and damage re @-@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post @-@ pol@@ l Monday , six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as the immigration lies in the spotlight , Mc@@ Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do too .
the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing to new heights .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of repub@@ li@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ sider status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with a government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious in Washington too .
a survey of Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago demonstrates that three out of four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 % &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ itely ret@@ arded . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street a square meter of a can@@ opy house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations a square meter is the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential sites , however , the price is similar to Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is , as an exception , not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double sc@@ orer in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller simply has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller led FC Bayern to pa@@ ve the way for a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel von Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of Train@@ ers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her first match in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ ate hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth victory in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third run .
at his 28th match in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership , Müller received good support from Olympic Games Director Roberto , who allowed a shot of the world champion to pass as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ n promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based spoken word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed vision without gl@@ aring .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus won his latest six home games in the top class , including several renowned clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
2011 also called Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , un@@ defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went very cour@@ age@@ ously with their offensive efforts , but often too in@@ ventive .
the attacks were often triggered by a game shift on Link@@ Sau@@ e Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k broke out of the right half @-@ field on the left upper Tor@@ que .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stur@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown hit the Pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper , Roberto , par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians bred their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set need@@ les .
but he was reli@@ eved on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
for instance , when he ste@@ ered a shot of Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola defended a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Vice President Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to do something else , this is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also on the first move , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley into Com@@ an for the ailing Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 5@@ 9. ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , and by El@@ f@@ meter Müller made one of them .
before the game , there had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bayern @-@ fans in their audience block obviously prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went with bat@@ ons against the Munich adher@@ ents .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured out of the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , not only har@@ ms the lungs , but also the teeth - this places a Potsdam long @-@ term study close .
the good news : at ren@@ unci@@ ation , risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this is a result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees at the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely , rising from 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear whether smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time , the researchers write in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks back to the level of non @-@ smoking , declared Mr. Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health right down to the old age .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness was affected , the DI@@ f@@ E divided .
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early failure .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists find rel@@ ics of late Anti@@ quity on the Rhine ri@@ ver@@ side
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
in all construction projects in the city district Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department of archaeological soil conservation .
in the third construction phase of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found the right choice .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , explained Trier .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .

EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over the TTIP
the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Free Trade Agreement ( TTIP ) .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration enti@@ t@@ lements for disputes between corporations and states should thus be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its mode of operation corresponds to significantly more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the presentation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de has proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
the TTIP will create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceeding stipul@@ ate specifically that the EU states and the USA jointly select independent judges for a new investment tribunal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is fores@@ een .
it would allow it to raise obj@@ ections against jud@@ gements .
up to now , the parties involved agreed among themselves on refer@@ ees , there was no possibility of enti@@ t@@ lement against their jud@@ gements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it became clear that Ci@@ tiz@@ ens didn &apos;t trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work towards an international investment judgment based on its own data .
there could then , for instance , resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which was demanded mainly by large corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the major opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel judi@@ ci@@ ary , on which companies can engage in compensation for damages of tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ y national laws or cut down consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act denoun@@ ced the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate .
above all , it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a big step forward .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission took into account key points when the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the opportunities for mour@@ ning of the economy by too many new rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized businesses could be dis@@ advant@@ aged , called it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the talks on TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) have been concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
until now , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart on which the shy @-@ looking folk singer has recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is nearly touched by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he repeatedly records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they were born and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can drift away to opul@@ ent opul@@ ent moments at any time .
the rum@@ or arises that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine there already appeared &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and has had positive expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here , St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
live guitar and ban@@ jo live for him .
a year later , the musician living in New York returns to the show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a celebrated masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
overl@@ apping ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the Bill@@ board charts and in no way missed the most influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after very productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic selling pieces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ation .
far from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are presented here for the colorful spectacle made of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the glo@@ omy Hamburg city More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens become in@@ timacy and folk .
without judging a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the audience one hears : the talk is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can therefore throw the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate away &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after an en@@ core St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually l@@ ends himself under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire with suspen@@ se
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to have made his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tion@@ na@@ ire and will join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , where his performance is likely to be checked by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the centre of several head@@ line stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence , &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ne &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme that he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally helped him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within Labour &quot; and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements to the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour sets aside to remove all the idea of limiting a total .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow Workers and R@@ ented minister said that the party was &quot; very clear , &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26.@@ 000 to £ 23@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , since he is T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch box across Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader who has promised a different set of policies says he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refrain from stri@@ fe and stri@@ fe with re@@ ins and instead intends to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges facing young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n has said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister will represent him if he does not participate , for example when Mr Cameron is on the road abroad .
he also raised the idea that other colleagues may occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , in order to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; P@@ unch and P@@ unch Beat , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the prime minister was regarded as the chief bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

Po@@ und increases by accelerated pay@@ roll growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose br@@ ittle according to data showing an increase in the growth of the UK &apos;s pay@@ roll . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid goal .
between May and July , the earnings without bonuses in the UK increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and quick@@ est estimate of the time of an increase in interest rates since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index finished with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking over offer of Riv@@ age AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher , following encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures show all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose by 5 % after the mining giant said that it took 2.5 billion $ by a stock sales as part of its strategy of reducing debt .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decrease after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his assessment on &quot; selling &quot; for the company R@@ ating .
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sport management company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the costs could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber in the Capital : on a Bi@@ eber expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber , meg@@ ast@@ ar .
a hi@@ ppy 21 year old , a pendant with a top@@ less FR@@ IS@@ E .
the type with plat@@ inum @-@ blonde hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bi@@ eber is in Berlin .
and Generation U@@ 17 sp@@ ins through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
for seven o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .
the Bi@@ eber Construction : here you live I@@ dol , whose poster ends up in Sz@@ cz@@ ec@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the Suite , where the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much a day as her M@@ um E@@ wa deserved in half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth class in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I fulfill her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
is compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who cares about it ?
the fans don &apos;t .
Bi@@ eber himself does not .
anyway , it took care anyway .
for the advertisement in the advertising rec@@ ess of the super@@ se@@ er , he c@@ ashed three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ ing company washed many , many dollars on the Bi@@ eber account .
and with every doll which looks like it and goes over the counter @-@ table , Bi@@ eber also collects .
when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one mar@@ vels at the window pane .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge to far .
others stress that Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; to number 1 .
Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ GI@@ DA @-@ poster brings Lebanese to a potato dum@@ pl@@ ings idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
both - and indeed in the potato @-@ don@@ er , developed by the Ol@@ denburg tak@@ eover owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue is turning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is mul@@ ticul@@ tural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea has meanwhile been registered by the Lebanese in the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even with his customers , the culinary understanding of the international community is good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met@@ a cash launches &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bottom line campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - attack &quot; &quot; &quot;
Met@@ cash attempts to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA Super@@ markets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
more details of its defense strategy are expected to be released on September 29 , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and devices passes through its annual investor strategy day .
there is a lot of stake in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins than the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will s@@ nat@@ ch around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailer could lose 360 $ million in revenue per year and met@@ amor@@ pho@@ sis 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year Al@@ di opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s high fixed cost base could cost around $ 13 million before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and the market share of 14 percent in 2015 will be reduced to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne that met@@ a cash would probably disappear within a decade .
met@@ a declined to publicly respond to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ &apos;s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the operational debt reduction with simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
however , the wholes@@ aler resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to equal sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths at hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in enhancing their stores through fast @-@ growing fresh foods and delivering a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging @-@ remedi@@ ation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ ril and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association , Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise rather than criticism for his own behavior . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , who is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious conflict of Cy@@ ril and St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka should have sm@@ ashed Kyr@@ gy@@ ny , and I should strike the child . &quot;
while he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp served a potential US Open Vic@@ tory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious about is the fact that , according to my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi has been drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a thu@@ g when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broke a thu@@ g out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard and he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well trained in the dressing area , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also decided not to take into account the decision to go to Kyr@@ gy@@ i on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term permanent component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not to all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe Nick has made the climb very quickly , which people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary elu@@ ci@@ dates emergency , closes the border , shel@@ ters refugees
Hungary declared the state of emergency and marked the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who were trying to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border when hundreds of migrants were in a No Man &apos;s Land and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation .
the people fle@@ eing from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a land strip along the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants began to chant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
talks with Brussels and other countries have to take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague .
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a str@@ it@@ ous meeting in Brussels failed to agree a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who fled to Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year would have reached an agreement that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a special summit in the European Union to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a soon @-@ to @-@ return action from Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency state launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent months Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and became an entry point to the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the incoming business refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees trying to protect them - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 ft ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also set higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament still needs to agree on the use of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come across by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences committed according to the new laws .
authorities are in the process of quickly re@@ pairing the fence .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos circum@@ v@@ ented the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container in order to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to inv@@ ade them .
about 20 were able to get in , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead over Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s former US Secretary of State continues to hold a double @-@ digit advance in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders is gaining ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the primary elections ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced to candidate for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders got some profits .
Clinton keeps a big lead in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support with the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders only res@@ ides here with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton however still has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the liber@@ als , but S@@ ander now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the voters of the local elections say that they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and would support another 15 percent only because they are the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would enthusias@@ tically support them .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman to be president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate will also be quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of voters want to see him in the race - though one third believes he should not do it .
if democratic voters are asked for the election , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to candidate for nomin@@ ating the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before S@@ anders increases , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent over the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call question the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as in the last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the election will be unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results in some of the important characteristics of voters in the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities regard Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den meets the three candidates best with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters do not have the opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being questioned as Secretary of State during the term of office , most Democratic voters are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it &apos;s a different story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinion , though 36 percent said that their opinion had deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say that their views of Clinton have become worse .
while Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 % see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider them an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
but Clinton and Tr@@ ump get good notes on leadership .
among the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but like Car@@ son many do not have any opinions about him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error ratio for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son approaches country@@ wide survey near Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son finds himself closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the voters &quot; support in the new survey is eliminated , and others are losing dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . the support grows 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes tr@@ ump among repub@@ li@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , has been defeated with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen at the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , is third in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people from Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey published last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post revealed also tr@@ ump in front of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ r@@ ings for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tr@@ ump faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : no more than 18 degrees Celsius has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with .
bath temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the East it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea , it is at peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a criminal ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Frat@@ ernity attacked ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police arrested .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to move across a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ si Brotherhood did not call for the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was im@@ potent and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically put the fr@@ at@@ ernity benefit over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly attached to head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh with bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ anes of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies in the ch@@ ic@@ ane every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for the murder of Third Gra@@ des for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of frau@@ ght attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we don &apos;t just want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local community .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the house @-@ se gets into j@@ ars , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance on the process .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate rise , and it took 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments respond .
therefore representatives of the US central bank stressed so viol@@ ently that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could , however , find that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no effects .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases may make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets return 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study about what happened after the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly up@@ war@@ dly - about 14 percent - on the way to increasing interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , CEO of plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published in Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on stocks will tend to occur later in the increase @-@ in cycle and the return on investment will start to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession .
it is not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate increase in the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , only twice the nominal GDP had fallen below 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed to increase the interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC is able to authori@@ ze an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all hei@@ gh@@ tening cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were put in the shadow very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volatile as the market has anticipated a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is quicker than in shares if they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , the returns seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increases cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest bonds often yield better yields in such a climate even though &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting , Jones , that the markets have already adapted themselves to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the reduction of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy .
large and large companies will benefit from the greater proportion of their business operations in the US , benef@@ iting from increasing interest rates and making local products more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts will become worse , as an increasing dollar will make their products more expensive on the global market , as well as the financing of their debt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares sur@@ passed their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; debt is a big problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains through higher earnings even though experts of differing opinions are how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Par@@ liam@@ entary member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the station for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EP colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked the Voice and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transforms itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , maintains a leading parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; conserv@@ atives MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di@@ sil@@ ently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC General Director rejected the accus@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I am learning from Radio 3 I will never learn from classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and making music that is truly un@@ matched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder work has to be done to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport came under fire to compete with the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins grip The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in special BBC way &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the next time it star@@ ed into an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the orders from other series of The Voice in the future or to issue money from the fees for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday may be responsible for it
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed off spending in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
yet experts say there are signs that online sales are stagn@@ ating after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with just five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that the online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phone purchases .
it meant more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting and we may see that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases prior to this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year there were five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites were collap@@ sing .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium concluded that out of £ 5 spent on spending a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now done through web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident Get@@ ting - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets .
Saudi Arabia recognis@@ es the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health promised that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s major mos@@ que .
ber@@ eav@@ ed , largely dressed in white , the stretch to pay their respect when the first of the dead started their last journey to the Al @-@ Mo@@ dena cemetery .
the procession departed from the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane crashed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king was hanging over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 injured , a san@@ ction suspended .
the bodies of 29 priests who were killed when a crane over@@ threw Mec@@ ca &apos;s Great Central Lake were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , as the crane was helping .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents prior to the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden Group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ speaking service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company was banned abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man praised the fall of the wre@@ ath , which r@@ ushed into an inner courtyard of the Great Grey Cem@@ etery , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which later this month .
the Bin Laden Group issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Greater Mek@@ ka &apos;s major mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the wre@@ ath crashed in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) to be paid to members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other dec@@ lines will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
British increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople from Eastern Europe has fallen behind
this leads to the opening of 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix stores aimed at tra@@ des@@ people
at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q will close sales points nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Manager of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its are laying h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled East European craftsmen who carry out their work in their home .
if you can use a hammer or brush to brush walls , it seems to be a minority nowadays .
for Br@@ its increasingly employ arti@@ sans to perform DIY jobs in their houses , according to the company &apos;s head behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe , which offer services to grav@@ ure prices , is now obsol@@ ete .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 further Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close to 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were made by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said it was necessary to face growing demographic trends that have more female single households that make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is still a majority of men in our stores . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to balance more strongly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has just 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing shops .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian volleyball court master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and submission .
the defend@@ ants ple@@ aded not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of mis@@ use .
from this accus@@ ation , he has been legally acqu@@ itted in May .
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary examination revealed that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants used funding from association accounts to which they could disp@@ ose of their functions , used for private purposes .
with around 400@@ ,000 Euros he is har@@ ming the damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sports officials are also accused of finance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fact divi@@ des the chair@@ woman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ath , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it should be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time the association had come into being an asset .
the sports officials only charged expenses compens@@ ations and the sport club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( roughly 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back then we were confronted with the situation : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the Office of the Financial Times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ defend@@ ant and co @-@ defend@@ ant , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there must not be any debts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
moreover , in case of a corresponding financial success , the reimbur@@ sement of the allowance compens@@ ations has been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
that is why I paid off part of the reimbur@@ sement of expenses only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been in the account .
as a result , Pau@@ schal@@ - and not detailed cancell@@ ations also appeared , as the former chairman explained the processes .
the two defend@@ ants , together , said the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us books together , said the second defend@@ ant .
why withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail by the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial statements , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , according to the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary , investigations on official abuse started , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
the defend@@ ants declared that this had been set@@ backs .
this securities account was based on the name of the second defend@@ ant and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know the answer for a long time .
then he finally thought that he was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor placed in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim remedy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wor@@ ding because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the function@@ ary said he has never paid a cent salary , he only calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and diets .
on diets , he charged the club 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were not able to show accurate records for the early years .
they were no longer kept for an operation check , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
all the exercises had to be done in cash , for which he had to go to the bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard presents more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff cuts running for three years , the computer giant will be able to build more jobs when the company spl@@ its up .
the positions at the US &apos; Compu@@ te H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the disman@@ tling of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs in the amount of $ 2.@@ 7@@ bn ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the ongoing reduction of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 associates .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard shares amounted to 2.3 percent on the stock exchange market .
the group from Pal@@ o Alto , California , is currently out of date : the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer , based on Lenovo , was once again a dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC market as well as a weaker demand for corporate customers according to its services .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ stan@@ cies , HP responds to the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would most likely be rejected : 54 % opposed , 35 per cent were con@@ sent@@ ing .
the fact that other states are flying air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 per cent , on the other hand , are to intervene in the conflict .
a cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , backs 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be for it .
29 per cent were not able to decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion on Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ laun@@ chers against several hundred re@@ ared refugees .
the Euron@@ ews Cor@@ respon@@ dent , D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ zi@@ k , has witnessed the out@@ burst of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water gun ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to officials .
initially , the officials stopped pe@@ pper@@ mint spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn a little . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees picked up in themselves and suffered short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time for almost a decade the interest has been raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists inter@@ viewed by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view , was that the F@@ ed would do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent will be held .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed acc@@ uses to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation where a large central bank may possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior member of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ro@@ y outlook on global conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds of such a step are good .
the decision is to be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death penalty at Delta State University left for ap@@ ology
after shooting and killing his friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; he announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone , and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency department that the police had to send police to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him .
lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
when the police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note Lamb made 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen surrounded him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , who supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was told by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said that they were married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ man Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; He does not go to prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen picked him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in the spring of 2015 , like his life law on the University &apos;s website .
stars who lost their lucky charm
the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years .
in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett because of cancer .
the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession .
all this certainly calls for his tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group by
Lufthansa is planning a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organisation .
around 1,000 executives from around the world will cost the company restructuring the workplace .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the cheaper exposure to Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is to generate a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , there is no longer a board of directors for the passenger business in the future .
the budget airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Management Board team headed by CEO Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with the new setting , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete with Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organisation of the 120 000 employees has been a complex undertaking .
the airlines operated under the umbrella of the Air@@ line Group Passage , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective bar@@ gaining agreement with the cockpit clean@@ up cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations after the court stopped strike will be resum@@ ed on this Thursday .
this was what the union announced .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement regulation for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predic@@ tive record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will result in yiel@@ ding results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the transition supply of the pilots , the background is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it seems that Lufthansa is expos@@ ing routes to the company &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ row@@ ings in the fight against competitors .

hat@@ ch Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brought the left outside defender to cry and will be excluded from playing for at least six months , then Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w had broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the board and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or maybe one day later .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
he had an oxygen mask in the locker room .
he wept .
I am not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months will last and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope to be able to play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to escape from a Red Card and the im@@ position of an i@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had been wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet of Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery is beginning now , I come back more strongly . &quot;

when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno got a leg break when Mexico played against Van G@@ als Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how difficult it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost mem@@ orized .
unless you are David Cameron .
when asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President opted for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead returns a summary of the movie version of 2012 that added new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot; a love interest was Dr Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
even though he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment through the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ f@@ ading , th@@ need stri@@ cken once @-@ ler , hears a ho@@ ck@@ ly , whi@@ r@@ ling creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row in a row .
a down@@ ing street speaker said that the text was probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circular office .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult
to meet Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude an ou@@ tri@@ ght victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page is probably less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batch setup , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on the test plane is an option for the attack .
news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ th breaks out of the England test @-@ cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket@@ players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been prolonged , but he had control over his own fate .
hopefully if he kno@@ cks out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss engaged his attitude even if he did not achieve such good performances , and that was not surprising me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test drummer receives to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick was nine .
only Comp@@ ton received the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first introduced Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in maximum form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer that I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
he is an X @-@ Factor @-@ Cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent bridge square , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances in front of him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to beat Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra Sp@@ in Bow@@ ler and got four squ@@ ads , di@@ pped up and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed man has already shown that he &apos;s a cri@@ cket player .
mos@@ een might not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but is he number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my previous team mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before opening up as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred re@@ ins immediately and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up @-@ sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see its statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punching , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ der who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some wise additions to the train@@ ee .
the appointment of Mah@@ lah J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as advis@@ er to the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , wasn &apos;t used at the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I didn &apos;t have a problem for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team performers do not determine the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with the players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart@@ edly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it Camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Out@@ going Britain from the EU ) could win in Zul@@ auf if the economy falls into a dol@@ drums by 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ fer@@ mented ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting deeper with every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , viol@@ ently crushed because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , how the EU is now and not always of their own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they usually do not want to be sati@@ ated .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
prime ministers and finance ministers are climbing at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they gain allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who desires a UK looking outside within the EU tent - &quot; Let us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and civil servants have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as happened in the exc@@ essively long endurance races like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain a left one .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the UK &apos;s sel@@ f@@ ie , whose energy should be used better to prevent Scotland &apos;s ex@@ iting from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
so maybe some such ministers intentionally plan not inten@@ tional comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum encouraged by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name for themselves as an &quot; EU straight ban@@ ker &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &quot; s .
with all his ins@@ anity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone hack@@ ers and the Pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about them , but realized that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you are better distributing ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had opposed the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened it a back door .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly clip on his back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ne &apos;s official position on Europe is - I feel friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild companions of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , aber nicht Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n im Radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ out in him fought , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or .
it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s when his old father tried on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
but fighting to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; Benn@@ ett &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all the reports on their cl@@ auses meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to Cameron not to give a free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left @-@ wing dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic con@@ ten@@ tions .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which was reminded on Monday by something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims by a state @-@ sponsored agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) signed up in Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Rev@@ oc@@ ation Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extremely wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which P@@ he explained his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor for European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said that the public expected that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to manage their opinions on the damages of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received funds from British American Tob@@ acco Resources ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also under@@ signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting stated to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding it should have received according to reports before the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not provided , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide an industry funding in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is sign wise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most of the criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however none of these connections or restrictions will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are significantly less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects .
he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is proof and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison with the tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people annually die from a disease related to smoking , and smoking cost the National Health Care system two billion pounds per year .
by suggest@@ ing current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not at risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ lane , former Head of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ - and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would be &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs not broadcast by other UK @-@ broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 .
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC uses or sends programs that would also clearly be shown by non subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future .
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I do not consider in the medium or long term for a good idea one should at least put his production on programs that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as broad support as possible for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financed programs that could also be funded without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ward is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm .
I would like to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ ers .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal &quot; niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their seemingly holy missions for justification of 4 billion pounds of broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee on the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think , we all think that one receives a great deal for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to verify their ethics mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , train and maintain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of the BBC production would be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example of this change in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on television , and with the commercial channels to enter alliances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change direction at the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by en@@ forcing Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
round@@ worms do not usually respond to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the enhanced ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the seas@@ oning cells .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , so a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ azi@@ ani genetically modified the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms where they turn on the modified motor neur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light sent to the desired position in the brain by optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin producing cells , he added .

&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP &apos;s creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons fair - through a laying of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender company publicity , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it remains stronger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what we need now is an intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step . &quot; &quot; &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
at the age of eleven I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ descri@@ p@@ tive to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to ch@@ ap : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ana , where you stand in terms of Cor@@ by@@ n and why you do not love nor hate Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not speak with , even if your eyel@@ ashes were set on fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people leave .
people &apos;s rooms often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and put on their under@@ wear .
related : don &apos;t Thin@@ k on Get@@ ting to the Uni with a Rel@@ ation@@ ship
intro@@ ver@@ ts get a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ ypass culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friend@@ ships .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I hold back the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him a SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residence halls had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship include baking .
since you begin the university at the high point of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to introduce themselves to a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less odd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I baked you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when they are kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence halls .
of course , the c@@ law of chickens is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to serve themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced people than my room@@ mate who added a pur@@ ge to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it would make sense to make Drum &amp; Bass a little qui@@ eter than it had three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with still more listening music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she pl@@ under her own music , shut down her door and proc@@ eeded to her three @-@ hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally enter the same residence hall ?
conver@@ sely , if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her , dis@@ integrate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she moves to each other &apos;s friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your subordin@@ ate a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is more subtle than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes bo@@ omer@@ ang .
grant by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never put one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
lock your door , and put your keys into a glass of water , which you then put in the freezer - but don &apos;t shake their hol@@ dings on the ceiling more than twice .

&quot; &quot; &quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need housing space , but also the single mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show you how to build still cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are being displaced to the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees are being forced into the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great deal here .
in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very tri@@ vial , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
mer@@ cen@@ ary : a row house needs the least amount of space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you teach people in blocks of housing .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers .
each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say that it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have legally performed my project correctly .
especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sh@@ wert special construction and the slot Ord@@ in@@ ance .
pri@@ us@@ el@@ ly .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
the place is missing only in the cities .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
mer@@ cen@@ aries : true , we had a building boom in Germany over the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ners .
I show you how to build still cheap and well today .
that is what it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , because they get an error message indicating that the &quot; software update failed . &quot;
to avoid the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes .
the telephone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
this can potentially mean dropping apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely by reducing the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install it as soon as the process is finished .
it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue as the phone may switch mid@@ way and this could lead to a rup@@ ture of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team mate Lewis Hamilton even a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second st@@ alled ahead of the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up runner before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far and won the flood light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
for days a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra .
bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a dedicated chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the Cities of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen has supported G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann with a donation , which Chairman Alfred Klein received .
thus it is possible to record chess players who cannot afford the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
district office looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; Alten@@ ative Centre &quot; were joined together under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consulting , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , you will immediately receive sen@@ iors and advice on questions such as health insurance or health and care insurance .
for years we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that often nur@@ turing family members are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not very often many health services are not taken into account because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business area manager , also for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ elli &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consulting , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this the Sal@@ u@@ di was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di complement each other ideally .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; says Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ di .
both business leaders will see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in the demographic shift .
this is because it is essential to make a good distributed infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the unification of the old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able contribution . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment as possible .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 : 00 .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang passed away at the age of 92
Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Vienna &apos;s architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday .
with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus becomes an honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as was said in the foreign language .
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 , he has worked as a freelance architect , but has also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and to rebuild the Palace of Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .
jail term : Tim Wiese delivers polic@@ ew@@ oman with money
former football player Tim Wiese is dis@@ liked in Bremen ung@@ ut .
foot@@ b@@ aller was once , now Tim Wiese , former Nation@@ alt@@ or@@ hü@@ ter in Germany and at Bremen and H@@ offen@@ heim engaged , W@@ rest@@ ler .
according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
he did not intellectu@@ ally oppose it .
Wiese was cutting his hair straight in the Bre@@ mer city center , when he saw how outside a parking atten@@ dant presented a ticket for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wiese cycl@@ ed out of the shop , insul@@ ted the officials and threw her the j@@ ailed penalty before feet , as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the city of Bremen one can confirm the accus@@ ations , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matter is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that I decided whether meadow will be shown or not .

men beat in 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 o &apos;clock , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft filling station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young and struck this with his fist on his face .
the victim had a nose @-@ break and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car up to the apartment and passed it demonstr@@ atively several times .
when one did not see the vehicle any more , the wounded passed in front of the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a strike @-@ stick , one was beating on the face and the th@@ igh of the victim .
the injured had to be taken to hospital for medical care .
so far , only a vag@@ ue description of the perpetr@@ ator lies ahead .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second bat should have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and advis@@ ors to sign up under the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes on the practice of field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen .
also the Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic sponsor U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased .
in many places in the country doctors are missing - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller took over the practice in the field on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still in half a position in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase , Müller opened the office on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the fields were met years ago by Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their medical training at the Ver@@ den Hospital and will also enter into practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the garbage cans would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen and laughing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was done , I simply called her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of practi@@ sing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler .
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so they agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice .
however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Chief Medical Officer in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ willingness for Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the new boss will be in charge .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ris@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as a general practitioner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; endos@@ copy is therefore out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a supplement of a total of 50@@ 000 Euro is provided by the Müll@@ ers as part of a funding programme of the County ( 25,000 euros ) as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the north German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ici@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor was found , it would have gone too .
who visits Müll@@ ers Spe@@ akers also continues to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical professionals and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ended , after all , the medical practitioners practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she feels a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to stay in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and will surely see many patients , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the dormit@@ ory . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed myself with gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and loves to travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we let the refugees pass through &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the border controls are also going up at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people must know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
the Croatian government had previously informed that Slovenia would continue to travel in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the margin of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ian will not ban his borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ head Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already attempted in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country with@@ drew around 4000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border that have previously led migrants to the Hungarian border were diver@@ ted towards Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade denied however that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor will we do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees had arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id . in the course of the day , further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants had been traveling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that was approximately 500 kilometers away through Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary had agreed , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could now actually lead to a somewhat further west line already predicted by observers of the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are conducted in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on Serbian side some 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to media reports , they spent the night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic attempted to calm down Wednesday early in a local eye appearance in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high refugee figures at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one could not say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun distributing maps on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not cleared mine fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

Sup@@ ran@@ o@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who has been accused of having gained insight into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the information captured , insi@@ der transactions should have been made in the financial markets .
in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proceedings against 32 other accused in the case continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted both in the US and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lot of activity around the Mannheim park .

they control the two stations of the Mann@@ heimer Au@@ x@@ al@@ on at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .

with this action , ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce appe@@ aled to its 20 @-@ year existence and is faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks , such as the volunteers .
while some of the pass@@ ant points spontaneously to the chal@@ k and the sentence about &quot; my life affir@@ ms , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; do not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences such as &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then continue .
again and again there are small discussions about the action on itself , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ on@@ ical work Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband supports the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action for 20 @-@ year @-@ olds is good .
the fact that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the tablets is understandable , however , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still associated with tab@@ oos , such as the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a great deal to opening up people .

F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply gi@@ ants decreased its profit prospects for a year because of the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire around 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for their vacation .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by more than 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said earning a profit from $ 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year that ends next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expect a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect , despite the price increases , amounts to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 , and despite higher rates for the ground transport of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gains solid earnings if we consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks asked analysts to expect $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which resulted in sales in its unit Express dispatch to stagn@@ ate .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter turnover in bo@@ d@@ ging increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the express unit reported higher revenues due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed at 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot @-@ Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade .
a mur@@ al of the United States lies at the end of the adorned , two @-@ storey meeting hall .
the card is a reminder that Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation ahead of all the other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented short@@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most data of the economy show that it is solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets might frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and it is also just a quarter percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty about the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which contam@@ in@@ ates the financial market itself .
about half of econom@@ ists who recently were surv@@ eyed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rise in interest rates this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator , which shows only a 30 % chance for an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts decrease the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ sky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets in order not to panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rise in interest would ease the financial markets because they would remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
still a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in spring and early summer Y@@ ellen had said that in this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the proposition was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for over seven years and near the level that F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , F@@ ed representatives stated that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world picked up at the end of last month , after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial average rose by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would ch@@ okes global growth .
the market has recovered slightly this month , with the Dow now being nearly 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence influences the complex calculation , when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would put on the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a grip on the impact .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will affect the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be considered technically in its decision making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere suggestion of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also discuss with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global Strategy for Asset Management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial markets that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ er , member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest rate , has been quoted as an example in 1998 / 1999 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives were revers@@ ing these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis such as the market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Bank of England &apos;s interest tigh@@ tening committee .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come close to this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest , because the markets are getting excited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this is changed , I do not believe it should advance the time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little help for refugees
more and more refugees are coming to Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 conferences .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is completely different from school than at a real school .
Rio Grande &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society promotes nutrition for healthy breast feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS , in a sho@@ cking way , tries to clarify how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck in breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should do .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can neg@@ atively affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the building contract for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may become more flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awaited gym@@ nasi@@ um construction on the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ welt step forward step by step : during the latest municipal council session , the elaborate construction application was unanim@@ ously approved .
prior to this , the committee had decided , among other things , to apply for a legislative &quot; exception &quot; or &quot; liberation &quot; of the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was the permission of a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ fit first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be built . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planning is the use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a result , we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the roof inclin@@ ation which is required for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan regarding the roof inclin@@ ation allows no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project for the building of a gym@@ nasi@@ um : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project between the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and mass sports sponsor@@ ship .
in the next stage , the construction application for the 18 x 36 @-@ meter hall is now presented to the Supervisory Board for the examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of the staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
these are the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
however , a decision on this will be made to the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the Hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to work with Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
the employees were informed of the plans .
the change is triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer @-@ Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead on 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this in any case signi@@ fies a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer with his team , if the supervisory board agrees , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ embassy , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refurb@@ ishment at the Wei@@ l@@ heim Hospital is completed .
J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the federal government , is to be used as accommodation for asylum @-@ seekers in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I conclude that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say that there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present there is a short term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has worked as chief doctor for more than 30 years .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened with closure in the last decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .

Jag@@ guy with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were seriously injured during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the Aber@@ deen on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) several hunters were in action , as the police informed .
after a gun release , an 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly this could happen to the accident was unclear at first .

missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old claimed to have killed the youth and threw their body into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missed a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , like the public prosec@@ utor and police said on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , captured on Tuesday evening , is considered to be a suspect , according to the fact that the investig@@ ators were admitted to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she did not come home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
when searching for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first hit the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the presum@@ ed perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
the det@@ ain@@ ee reported to the authorities in the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds were killed and the body laid down in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the prison judge on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him to death .

refugees need accommodation : study warns against vac@@ ancy
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a affordable housing .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens about the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social H@@ ousing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany .
this will lack 140@@ ,000 apartments .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation .
many come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures .
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is shooting a housing deficit that gets bigger from year to year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently around 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther compla@@ ins , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities necessarily in WG rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the exposure to the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita in recent years has decreased again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a new start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
thus , the property tax would be wai@@ ved and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be subject to a limited period of time .
in addition , attractive tax write @-@ downs are necessary according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for state bank Kf@@ W refugee accommodation is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been sum@@ mon@@ ed on Monday evening of 18@@ 4 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary there is practically no passing through , because more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb has announced that the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous anyway .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia about the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Interior Minister and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe .
500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the Croatian television channel RT@@ L reports .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
moreover , new laws that came into force on the same day make decent asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic announced : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , it is people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the Serbian border to the neighbouring country of Croatia in the morning .
most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came by bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia on foot .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet border guards .
there are other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ v civil war in the 90@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mine clearance should now quickly create a safe passage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Hungary , however , after the closure of the border hardly any more refugees come .
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 challenged people .
just before the closure on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws ev@@ oke the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
sentences of up to five years and the deportation from the country threaten the condemned ones .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; tran@@ se@@ ons &quot; set up at the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children as well as two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees .
however , practically no one has a prospect of receiving asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier grids were disman@@ tled and one of the reception centres in the bor@@ der@@ land was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express themselves about the purpose of this conversion .
Austria reaches only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country according to government information .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the continuation of their journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped at the instruction of German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing there were regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; str@@ anded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were busy after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s conclusion , &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the stu@@ ds along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we did not stop the unexpected guests , with a snack and a drink .
we immediately said that we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation .
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched to a regional train in W@@ els from an ICE train to Passa@@ u . after the announcement that the train was suspended in Germany , it was still trying to cross the border .
the regional train , however , was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the cross @-@ border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably joined the union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen the Sunday soci@@ ably - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria .
the fact that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical outcome of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of ai@@ ding in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our Chancellor officially and publicly supported the attitude of the Hungarian government to the Dun@@ ties of National Socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mainstream politicians are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to state that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a big challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter in order to make decent conditions for people seeking protection .
and it will be an even greater - maintaining peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ rad has all hands full with the tor@@ ment of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place qu@@ arti@@ ere for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first acquisition centre of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already taken hold of Konrad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even the confin@@ ement of 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without great vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad , with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ igen year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodation units have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the govern@@ ors .
they would have assured him to create neighbour@@ hoods also for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , with the help of clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also puts great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday Konrad and Ma@@ ier critic@@ ised the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that district en@@ co@@ ders must maintain a certain height of the towel rack or the size of the sky@@ lights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to be valid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , establishes that in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he is more successful in accommodation .
I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is its most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t inc@@ ur any costs for the republic , as they declared themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their head@@ count on three to four .
up to now , our own quest for qu@@ arti@@ ts has not yet been successful .
Con@@ rad wanted to place a container on Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being no opening of city sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center to accom@@ o@@ date refugees plans the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , since the persons affected can currently not be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites are to be tested for their suit@@ ability .
the city chief is critic@@ ised by the allocation of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer phone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday announced the further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
special trains with refugees to Germany will not be available for the time being .
the guards , however , were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again demanded greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria now leads to controls in its borders is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general restoration of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially finished . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is drawn into S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented out to young , innovative companies from the technology sector .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the IT , intelligent minds are our raw material - and we must try them to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the new shi@@ py@@ ard and later to acquire some of them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises some promising : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
€ 1.7 million has been invested in the location of S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federal Government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second business in the Arctic
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of the new shop .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to be postpon@@ ed by the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt ar@@ cade : after all , it has now gained an increase in the shape of a further business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop in which they sell among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been converted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have long considered whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were attracted by the idea of a site where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Greater Region who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who even have Italian roots .
her fashion interest has placed Br@@ eit from her mother in the cra@@ dle .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women look into rap@@ ture when looking at a hand@@ bag , the specialist woman can not answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag upgrades every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether it is alien@@ ating alien@@ ation , re@@ porters or revealing knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the applicant for the US presidential office s@@ wir@@ ls the campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also recorded in the P@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; öhn@@ camp@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a concept many in the wine gro@@ wer village at the wine road . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 @-@ habit@@ ants place are related to it over -@@ ei@@ ghty corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ stadt rider Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , to which besides Tr@@ ump also owns the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also in the opinion that Tr@@ ump is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of a mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt im Um@@ kreis , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the en@@ co@@ ders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tr@@ ump comes from the village of the en@@ co@@ ders .
the success story of Tr@@ ump began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the corner@@ stone of the real estate company was the first real estate purchase in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state where the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time .
he did not record the tr@@ ump because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ onic History and People &apos;s wound , Roland Paul , declared a film start .
&quot; &quot; &quot; jump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of tr@@ umps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement looks more distant to the American , &quot; he is always so up@@ lifting . &quot;
does he think that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he never cared for K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension land@@ lady Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned as many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family during a visit gave something for the church organ , which was generally good .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be better if he did not win the election because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the US had been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ o@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not my President , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12 000 cinem@@ go@@ ers , even in the USA the interest aw@@ akes .
the Upper @-@ Bavaria municipality of Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
from the hands of vice @-@ president at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants &quot; village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the local alpine club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hurry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the state capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Riv@@ ale Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television programmes , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the uprising did not seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , as sunrise had an average 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , Today , a slight increase in ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number left behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August , Today , Today , Today , it reached an average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 went smoothly .
so far in September , sunrise at an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators stands at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ es@@ ar of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wit@@ ched father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven was strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily struck The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia achieved 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour there were 7@@ 20,000 spectators .
average Hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quotes of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 pm .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to beat the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood ends at The Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three girls left will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons fel@@ lows a day before three two , you may have acci@@ dently made an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood stays sealed up to the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; their answers could become a cor@@ rup@@ tor who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both called both quickly - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sar@@ ahs ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah is on Earth with both feet , so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now reserved for him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who was to choose Wood , if not her , then she was pu@@ zzling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls alike - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on 10 p.m. on Wednesday , 7 : 30 p.m .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open day of training at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have banned Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies in front of the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his cro@@ pped catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy at 2@@ Day@@ f@@ 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a po@@ orer start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut back then in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was still a great experience for the 27 year old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W fall @-@ fall in Groß@@ stadt before a heavy crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools when there is not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools in front of the collapse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get dis@@ cour@@ ages in the Bavarian educational system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conven@@ es in the Fran@@ con@@ ian commun@@ e until Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , Ai@@ v@@ ans also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum seekers : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria shifts away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to become more responsive . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the provincial politics in the city of Great Britain should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing issue remains on the agenda : education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot test of &quot; middle level plus &quot; at 47 high schools , with which an extension of the upper secondary school of three to four years is tested .
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools we want . &quot; &quot; &quot;
free travel at G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .

4 people killed after police officers shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the Southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd which demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ ach@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before they resor@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , which are traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Israel@@ ites would say that new provinces , which are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent disputes over the past 10 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that had killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the estate at the Em@@ den Youth Centre &quot; Alte Post &quot; is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned , but there are no concrete proposals yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den is planning to market some 4,000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Youth Centre of Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
the plan is to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
wait for appropriate offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor to question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property located on the Ring@@ straße / corner Große Straße , which was bought several months ago and the buildings on it were torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
planning for a holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the Investor creates public plans for the project for the first time .
many residents continue to worry - they fear the sale of their leisure activities
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , p@@ onder@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the little sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Urban Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 people .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the ten to twelve million euro investment projects have been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among sea @-@ bu@@ den@@ ers who had come to the meeting called out the pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Schulz , sea bu@@ den@@ holder and member of the board of advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a giant knife that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , like many other project critics , he fears that traffic should increase sharply due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole loads to make this happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on the well @-@ hect@@ are site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first , we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ asing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches double donations campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign to help thousands of refugees that have rolled over the European nations as they flee from war @-@ torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark train and bus routes , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four char@@ itable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally raised donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / were created to be doubled to 11 million $ .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war crushed by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for easily overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether easily obes@@ e people with diabetes continue to live longer than those who do not receive surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial about the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery .
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight relative to size , is considered to be normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment at 29 .
among those undergoing surgical intervention , 36 % fell in the diabetes condition and at 28 % partially .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes slow@@ ed down completely only in one percent and , in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient blood level of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased A@@ 1@@ c level of around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , leading researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14,@@ 2 kg ) , achieved higher BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and marked a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity operation , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have tightly bound their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is an issue that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she was able to set up a literary monument in her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East langu@@ ishes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances , the interests of humanity should be placed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts in tac@@ kling the crisis , he stressed that it is only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is less@@ ened in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and revealed that the violent reaction of the United States drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four @-@ fold increase in the use of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the past 4 years
poison control centres in the US report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years , which swallow strong alcohol disinf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia &apos;s Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of income of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years old , the poison control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children would drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ating in the social media .
YouTube videos show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents are said to have mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of the disinf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ infection products ) are the ones that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent , which are very attractive for children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants , few sp@@ lashes of alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation can lead to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center at the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 station in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t have any si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children get on it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry herbal disinf@@ ect@@ ant at school , was taken into a emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ e@@ emaker who treated her at the winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ur@@ ned her words and was unable to walk when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctor supervised them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had blown his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ vie@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol in@@ toxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected to death cases .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed following the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was listed as an ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth class in the state of New York planned to poison their &quot; gem@@ a &quot; teacher by placing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the failed plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed up against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who now stand at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic already had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly like that - but we must continue .
we really need the support of Celtic , because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious with January transfers
despite his comments just a few weeks ago , which pointed out that he had split several January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ts and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x Ka@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the crew is really good .
sometimes more damage is caused by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .
Celtic Target person Mich@@ u with guide
S@@ wan@@ sea @-@ Stür@@ mer Mich@@ u , with Celtic during the transfer period , has indicated that he can withdraw if his contract exp@@ ires at the Sw@@ ans .
the 29 @-@ year @-@ old has been pla@@ gu@@ ed with a bo@@ ther@@ some k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les for two years and has not made the departure from Wales this summer .
Hear@@ ts on S@@ FA battle for N@@ eil@@ son &apos;s comments
the Hear@@ ts conducted 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and then lost 3 : 2 , but the Red Card of the defender was later lifted - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son stays with what he said and insi@@ sts : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no power commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid ty@@ co@@ aster
the incor@@ rigi@@ ble Hi@@ bee was corrected after he admitted to have sung a song with offensive texts about Ex @-@ Hear@@ ts player Ru@@ di Sk@@ ac@@ el .
the incident occurred in a pub in the Ros@@ eb@@ urn area of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ essi@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Stür@@ mer and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ rot@@ le if it does not play for Celtic Glasgow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ dice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dun@@ dee @-@ United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s Executive Board still has confidence in the management team to turn things down - but it is written that the decline in the playing field has to end .
I think Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we &apos;ll get the guys back on track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; win &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen was desper@@ ately struggling against Hamilton Ac@@ compan@@ cies in order to see a seventh consecutive league victory giving them a margin of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam ro@@ one@@ &apos;s El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in cups or le@@ agues that haven &apos;t won the games of that kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it increases in the UK overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in May @-@ July , while the number of people without labour for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the numbers of the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland dropped 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except in a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by le@@ thal injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed .
when the day came closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and there are often more applicants than available seats , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media slots from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we talk .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you &apos;ll get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
she admitted that &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I do .
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I have said and written .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would owe him to be an bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective , I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters whom you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after wet police persecution persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the c@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer attempting to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale were called on Tuesday for a peac@@ ef@@ ull incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ sh@@ ev@@ ec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
team soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threaten to end the race .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what was best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came about the positive cobal@@ t t@@ amp@@ er test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it was going on .
sometimes you re@@ acts and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk up@@ lifted and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had the bomb blast in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him employment in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ ammer .
if that is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , president of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this and are still today .
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L act cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is now letting it think about it now .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t investigation at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the ou@@ tra@@ ged Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay had been applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which pushed against the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it also had it on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know anything about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy kno@@ cks back against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring struggles
&quot; &quot; &quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critici@@ zed the Tac@@ kling of its players as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson declared that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm @-@ players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high Storm triumph in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a little disgu@@ ised remark to the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy was defending the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his team and said they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at tac@@ kling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers on his team was confident that they were worried about being struck by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time comes up again and again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring struggles when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy told on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real center of gravity , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to exercise . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is already funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting soccer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he will take care of it .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play , if you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this .
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game Bron@@ co vs. cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm team has released this weekend because they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the Pre @-@ final at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ b@@ ail after drug deposit
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to get into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a $ 200,000 deposit .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the yacht port during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that could have been in the cafe for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stated on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ ent declarations of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , reports to the police daily and is at a cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : the driver &apos;s cab breaks apart

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ ophil@@ us used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of un@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzing computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; related &quot; web searches , which used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said that it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , and not to appear before court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg did not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict by October to obtain background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a b@@ ail , but was kept in detention due to hear@@ ings to other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the judgment date .
slu@@ ices switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more and more refugees are taken up outside the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many locks left people more often at smaller border cross@@ ings out of fear of discovery and arrest .

the crowd makes it : every two years , the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
in 2015 , it is above all noticeable in the compact cars that are currently selling very well .
cars from the compact class are currently particularly popular : approximately 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the German Federal Office of Transport ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( Pub@@ lication Days 17 to 27 September ) .
between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year .

&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the show .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not become much more expensive .

&quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square metres of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cell are human un@@ worthy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the Judi@@ cial Det@@ ention Unit Te@@ gel , which was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally demand financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were imprisoned only a few days in confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on a free foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant against the Land of Berlin failed due to the un@@ worthy detention conditions .
however , the Constitutional judges rendered the verdict of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ al and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if only a few days of detention for compensation were author@@ itative for legal reasons , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber judgment must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
it was only in April that they spoke to a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , the multi @-@ layer assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ deser@@ ving of human dignity .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
the then pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff was hospit@@ alized for three months between 15 to 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Kar@@ lov@@ y case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also come to the head@@ lines for lack of personnel .
det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , which climbs aggres@@ si@@ veness , even at ra@@ ckets it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ kar@@ st , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to young lack , 19 are to drop off in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are creating this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to embrace her .
what to do in Germany ?
according to the Federal Ministry of the Interior this year , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this , and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the following overview shows what is coming to Germany .
according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
but the lack of living space is dramatic , especially for affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units come out of the rental price binding , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply for refugees .
therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing each year would have to be created and for this the Con@@ federation would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; both scientists and Federal Buil@@ ders agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institut für Arbeitsmarkt@@ - und Berufs@@ forschung ) it is assumed that 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications in order to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial to find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for esteem in the receiving society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Tief@@ än@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the heir to the throne , there has been a political revers@@ al : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work .
while there was previously a prohibition of unemployed for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence requirement that limits asylum seekers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of the shortage of skilled labour - there is a majority in the view that refugees faster access to the labour market should be made possible .
a large barrier to access to the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
research also shows that workplaces are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is the king &apos;s way to work integration according to the view from the heir to the throne .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents , it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schi@@ ert , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the demand for educ@@ ators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacities - for instance by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of the German will be prepared for classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ suit@@ case from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state of asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was previously Berlin , interior sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his position now .
student @-@ willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence permit or cancellation get no benefits according to the asylum application law more if they start a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , the latter do not get a B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the persons entitled to an association .
tolerated refugees had to live in Germany four years so far to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , this span is shortened to 15 months from 1 January 2016 .
but this gap must also be closed , so that Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students were supposed to get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually enter into Islam the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to evolve into a new state @-@ religion ratio .
the establishment of an Islamic welfare organization , which takes care of newcom@@ ers in a professional manner , would also be important .
rights also include duties .
thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , vo@@ iced concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
those who wanted to impose such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately had their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will in future be much more than today a subject of the whole society .
as a result , the majority society will have to change , and the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing .
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination zone and a general equality law since a decade .
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrants &apos; organisations and stakeholders &apos; interest groups have long been calling for and why international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention bind Germany must become reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general Germany is in a position to provide medical care for the previously expected refugees , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to hand over health cards immediately .
services rendered could later be deduc@@ ted from the federal states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to cast so many people with the limited range of services that the asylum application law fores@@ ees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides , the doctors make it possible to create language barriers .
already so far , so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more educated about their illnesses than other patients .
it is not only in clinics but also in medical practices that interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over by them .
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among refugee children , for example , there are clearly more un@@ treat@@ able disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ clari@@ fication .
with the other cases of illness , German doctors come from their training , but it is clear that Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation and tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , the refugees may even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take a test again .
according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder also suffer from so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
Mun@@ z explained that in order to prevent the symptoms from chron@@ ically treating , Mun@@ z explained .
however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have received psycho@@ therapy so far .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers in the social offices can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy , the treatment usually lasts several months .
in addition , in the social offices , in most cases , non @-@ skilled workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
Mun@@ z says this often leads to mis@@ calculations .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new production &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst picks up the traditions of cir@@ cus arts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal training and unique entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus rehear@@ se in the Man@@ ege on the brick , wash for dre@@ aming .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years , the Circus is in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift for fan@@ atics lies in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important for us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; man@@ e cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the Circus Festival features talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .

sixty employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to different animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not good for our animals , we are not good either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each match .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , are read by the eyes as far as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to enter the arena .
the top priority is : care for the animals .
especially on its zeb@@ roid @-@ jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ P@@ ony@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst spoke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are with all our hearts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at its shows every day from 17 to 20 September every day .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe Ac@@ ting Fal@@ se Spe@@ ech in the Parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread over the social media .
the opening of the parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions by members of the opposition , that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with the Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month , they had denoun@@ ced him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Democratic Change Movement ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones they warned against disturbing Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity is ending in Parliament and once they leave the Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than $ 2.7 billion in the fourth quarter , while HP stated in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chair and Chief Executive , leading the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before , in order to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing un@@ at@@ tain@@ able , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the return from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation stays according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story , his participation in the European Championship will certainly be uncertain in the coming summer .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then back to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not associated with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as few recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant sample .
the trial of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als 15@@ 7 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two premi@@ er league clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , who have seen most of the injury days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a possible time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat strength , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves .
Arsen@@ al begins its champi@@ ons League season on Wednesday night versus Din@@ amo Zagreb facing the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is introducing a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to give a little bre@@ ather @-@ break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al is clear favor@@ ites to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
Dynam@@ o is defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger thinks that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains motivated by the distant hope of leading the association to his first European @-@ apo@@ calyp@@ tic triumph with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show which teaches us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the lack of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men demonstrate on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a her@@ edi@@ tary life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of asking the culture to seek help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to overcome this challenge .
a recent study at more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends in order for a friendship to work .
in the age of communication led through social media , with its emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , liv@@ able and successful , even though in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner y@@ earning for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football gu@@ cks in cozy arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can relate to it in any case , even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing I explained to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised is really clear to me how even the smallest interactions among friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when one speaks openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status about the phone may also help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , when you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest on this weekend with the fully re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to comedy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G , Malm@@ ö to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria is celebrating with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria arrives in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French master to the road , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions , before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ an@@ ie scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in the A group , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they do not only seek the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter@@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career back in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents and to look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ected over the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which in the weekend could hold 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why when he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before joining Johan Wil@@ and passed beautifully into the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who fought Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in advance .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes got up , with some mis@@ passes and bad degrees , not least from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who p@@ pled only in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot .
nevertheless he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c who turned Di Maria into a shot that was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ an@@ . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an scored his sixth win of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could come back into play , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacing a gate at the end of Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi .
the coach from Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification matches are not enough . &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
a few years ago the FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times a Spanish champion , three times champion championship , four times champi@@ ons league winners , twice champi@@ ons champi@@ ons , twice champion champion , twice champion champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was standing at Barcelona in front of the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça would sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Romanian wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
remember : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann was appointed FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great Euro . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i was standing for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s Triumph in the end .
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the film industry
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the diversity and said she wouldn &apos;t be needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in reference to a black protagon@@ ist in the selected screen@@ play of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the occupation of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian settled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to encourage people to think about - whoever will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te beaten by her white col@@ der .
the producer of Dear White People sat on the film for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o . Dam@@ on said her direction &quot; in the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO KNOW that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ ets earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
when the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved country @-@ wide impact and urged law@@ makers and authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against colour content .
in February , singer Prince played an all@@ usion to the motion during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sound@@ matter matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a group of love , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could finish all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 @-@ foot long rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Great Prize of $ 1 Million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , one gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , he gets the great sc@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
he received a lot of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad it &apos;s Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt exactly the same if they had exchanged roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for a second season , filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers passing by Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target field .
the T@@ wins wasted a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American league of Wild@@ card .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ Word that was hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad P@@ ou@@ m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintains his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inner ring , then once in the sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck six times in the 1 / 3 inner ring and enabled three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to put an end to this year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go into the game completely focused .
the designated tiger @-@ dog Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three hit game ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he had sw@@ ung his sleep well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mo@@ er@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked clearly better out of the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the back@@ round at the end of the seventh Inn , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton terminated the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached Bun@@ te , and Simon gave his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ f@@ lowed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the finale @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third woofer Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the leading 27 times this season in the Major League , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe scored a Double Play
after adding an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth inner ring , Berlin secured a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ handed man stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit became the beginning of the game from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the Tig@@ ers achieved three cracks in the first two inner ring against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing for more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
having received the Le@@ ad@@ off bat@@ ter in the first , H@@ ushes completed a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in second , achieved one @-@ out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single by Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins &apos;s manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he got the right job .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch Count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the litter &apos;s school@@ mates .
he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August due to a shoulder tie , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP will kn@@ itted Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
since 20 August he was missing in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees should be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people who came here should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in the past days .
up to 1000 refugees can be temporarily suspended there .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
over the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse had arrived in Hessen , according to the government presi@@ dium of the government responsible for the first recording .
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective vision &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were happy that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military involvement in Germany had passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the spot for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television station ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany also sent no refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border checks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers intend to take a new start to the binding distribution of more 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday , 22 September at a special meeting .
given the strong refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Chancellor Merkel on Tuesday evening after almost four hour consultations with the Prime Minister of the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who need protection also depl@@ ore this .
but those who don &apos;t have a lead @-@ perspective cannot stay in Germany either .
this view was strongly divided in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort exer@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later the government in Budapest announced to tie down the border to Romania with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wanted to prevent the smu@@ g@@ gling of smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of more migrants were making their way to the Greek border .

therefore the moon is easily te@@ asing on its orbit around the ring plan@@ ks .
although this movement is small but still too large for a permanently solid cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) on Tuesday .

R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
the 1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama for about a month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old has shown an examination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to the Munich Lion , the diagnosis is &quot; four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a heavy loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , we must think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sporting director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view of the possible commitment of a non @-@ compromise professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive tool .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Austrian National Player is supposed to enter the running training on Thursday .

contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a severe he@@ ap of blood .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line will often fall away from them .
man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them , B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives sav@@ our@@ y dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some let@@ tu@@ ce salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ea and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS again provides up to 9@@ 5,000 temporary relief for the Christmas business in the USA .
the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , U@@ PS shared on Tuesday .
above all , drivers are sought .
last year U@@ PS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5,000 temporary workers .
in the face of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its rival F@@ ed@@ Ex meet in the past year to be prepared for the Christmas business .

first fo@@ eh@@ ling storm , then marked cold front
in the coming night , the F@@ öhn winds its way in the valleys of the night@@ club side , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and the night on Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n blows sometimes with storm intensity by the pe@@ ers .
after gro@@ oming on Thursday morning we cross a marked cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive grav@@ ure area above the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current .
on the side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys at night .
as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ orn valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partially also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn is able to advance in some places to the adjacent central area , and on the mountains there are even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday , stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n provides for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to accumulate on the mountain slope .
rain starts here , which lasts until Thursday night .
in total , over the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some 100 litres of rain per square meter will have to be calculated , since large rainf@@ all has already fallen in the last few days .
on Thursday morning , the air dri@@ fts off , in which a cold front rolls with powerful , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind refresh@@ es strongly until stor@@ my , and the temperatures rise significantly .
the following days per@@ sist in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , whereas in the south it will be sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the weekend .
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Platz in Rome .
in the presence of the town president Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on Wednesday by the name of the German Re@@ former .
on the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now recognized as &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is right in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the name was proposed by the working group of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , parish priest of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , on Wednesday rec@@ alled that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that their tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 for several months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a perfect sin ba@@ bel .
according to historians his negative impressions might have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against aband@@ on@@ ment .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gil@@ ded ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the word ?
no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures .
in the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formul@@ ates his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Book of All Books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themes such as cross @-@ way , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
in doing so , he immediately became fascinated by several partners : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective scrip@@ tures based on painting .
he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt and so into today , translated into current context . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror by Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original quotation from Martin Luther and one set by the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing has always happened with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up , perhaps to carry on with the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to restore the art of art in the quick@@ est period of time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being sup@@ planted .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures have always something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewers to &quot; fall in &quot; into the pictures , let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost agreed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
I am not paying attention to the fact that the Bible is fully compreh@@ ended , but also the mysterious subjects that are important for him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was no collaboration on eye level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here it &apos;s about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s paintings speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X train approaching
plans made , space found , company commissioned to model earth &apos;s hill for a circuit : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished .
failures in politics and administration ensured confusion , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway .
so hill de@@ ported , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval was received in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further pause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees until 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga le@@ verages a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the p@@ itting situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy its help in tac@@ kling the pending problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the office next Wednesday and meet the minister of state Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be politics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore extended its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Refu@@ gee Initiative for four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta .
some federal states also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will be entitled &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left jer@@ sey race instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes on everyone , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can play football clubs , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on this Friday the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large common work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their places have started their own projects is great .
it is just as great that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will , together with the German federal government &apos;s DF@@ B selection and the federal government , provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : CEO of SAP loses an eye in case of accident
according to several reports , the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
during the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he bore in his left hand reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost bleeding , fain@@ ted , he pulled out of the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in early October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP head office in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to rise up once you have fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

football : Bv@@ C without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : court of wil@@ lows in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football league in Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday at the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ deck against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect him to return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ kel will not only change its stem cells on the R@@ eus position .
he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of gene@@ alogy Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher lau@@ ded the world champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is in the future in all Europe League matches , Tu@@ chel has left the door open .
with a high probability he will also compete in the second game .
the for@@ sche statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final entry for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the target , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl holds for plau@@ sibility : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to grab the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ro@@ bot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of cars .
on Wednesday the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the outskirts of the Automobile Show IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries coming together at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) with representatives of the industry .
among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and spe@@ edy access to digital radio .
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that the driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are imposed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles to be increased from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also plans to implement a change in the Vienna Convention that has so far only envis@@ aged man as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wait far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany location estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to about 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD @-@ transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday of the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ ative organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent expect that 31 percent do not believe at all at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , 33 percent in the USA .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
at least 15 per cent could imagine that on the motorway , 45 per cent could be seen in traffic jams .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l tells team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
after current stand@@ ings , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only want to hit the mark on September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision is to be made at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Champion Jörg Ross during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this point Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship event in China .
the 34 year old German Champion will be back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Individu@@ al @-@ European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ a@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ elin , who leads the S@@ etz@@ sch@@ l in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo was missing , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the world ranking list . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has contracted a serious injury on the right leg .

it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they are wearing the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of Hau@@ te Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , in the meantime it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18th September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his le@@ aning posture to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously done in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely surviving works of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total art work for which much effort was done : in order to fr@@ ater@@ ni@@ ze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was specifically hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have flo@@ gged to Munich for 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , delicate fashionable attempt by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good pup@@ il and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to play him .
the throwing of fashion he later taught himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , such as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it naturally .
he did not have to pay the models for his first own fashion show .
they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of sheer curtain - P@@ lau@@ ed tip as a fashion niche
it used to go to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in great quantities for customers who processed it for example to blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en family .
instead , fashion is important again .
fashion played a major role in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en peak and was then pushed out by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , borrow@@ ed from past styles , is an increasing order potential .
anyone who does not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they already execute half of all orders .
To@@ gol@@ ly P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and Sti@@ cker@@ eien together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products are hardly able to reach the customer in this way .
nowadays the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is almost exclusively sold through chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up to date in Russia and the United States .
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of der Stick@@ erei in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that have to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , an existing design often only slightly varies in order to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ opened the historical snow@@ ball point .
at the same time , the machine stops small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was not able to do anything before with traditional prun@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also deliver to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento .
as a result , I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; -@@ Film
legends are not supposed to touch , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not a re @-@ movie but a kind of continuation which takes place 20 years after the first film with the magic n@@ anny .
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family during the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the director is already determined : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the cinema . &quot; &quot; &quot;
XI aims to open the economy wider to the world
the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the steering of reform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should aim to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee to deep@@ en a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote new start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; Xi told .
the leadership group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relax the border controls policy , promote state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , take up private capital , and over@@ haul the inhabitants &quot; milking system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified , which are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
the initiative is important , as it plays a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guarantees a right @-@ state business environment and is more open to the market , said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lock up controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , additional areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded enterprises and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting also Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit value in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission intends to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus increase consumers a significantly higher dose of neur@@ on drugs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is a corresponding working paper of the EU , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industry and environmental policy will be passed on with full force on pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or sword fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ available .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the planned limits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy @-@ toxic heavy metal that is highly toxic over food chain , especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even small amounts can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to the nervous system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially in un@@ born cases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the maximum levels in force , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury goes first and foremost through coal combustion into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants meet more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in Elbe , Rhine and Danube , is &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; quoted from paper in March .
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most commonly reported health risks in the RA@@ S@@ FF EU warning system .
