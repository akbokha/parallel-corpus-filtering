any claim that the community or state is asser@@ ted against the organization or organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or a state due to damage , except for damage from a nuclear incident , is governed in accordance with international law .
if the Council , after checking the relevant information submitted by the Director General , determines that the organization is not in a position to verify that there is no core material which must be subject to security measures , nuclear weapons or other nuclear war@@ ping bodies , it can report the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) of the Stat@@ ute and , if necessary , also take the other measures provided there .
in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been acquired by the applied security measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the parties concerned is affected - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security .
on request of the organization , community or state , consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention will be consul@@ ted .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention are examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes settled by the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process or by another by the Organisation , the Community and the States shall be attached to an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators .
the community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth , who leads the chair@@ manship .
if the Community and the States or the organization have not designated two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for an arbit@@ ration request , the community or organization may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure should be applied , if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator of the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been chosen .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure to be applied when implementing the provisions of Section I concerning preventive measures .
the aim of the safegu@@ arding measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear weapons from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear war@@ ping bodies for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence by the risk of early detection .
to expe@@ dite the objective set out in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal engagement and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical termination of the post@@ ings by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which the quantity of material not shown for a certain period of time is specified under specification of the accuracy boundaries for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their post@@ ings , the organization makes use of the security system of the community in accordance with Article 3 full use .
the accounting and control system of the core material in accordance with this agreement is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in applying its preventive measures , the Community will make use of de @-@ procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , envis@@ age how they are more closely determined and expe@@ dient in supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost , lost or otherwise derived from the stock and stock levels ;
( B ) the evaluation of the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of the measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedures to evaluate accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system that displays the core material stock for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
( g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this agreement do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel circle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the amount and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other material produced in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states , it is subject to the securing measures mentioned in this convention .
a ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the community is temporarily not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , so consult the organization and the community about the use of appropriate securing measures .
B ) The safegu@@ ards provided in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community agree that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the safegu@@ ards following this convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material , when used in gram - or small amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) nuclear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the core material that would otherwise be subject to security measures under this Convention , provided that the total amount of material liberated from this Article in the States is no longer at all .
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ ell@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
( III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ time square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of 10 metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if freed core material is to be processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures under this agreement , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ application of the securing measures on that material .
the community meets with the organization supplementary agreements that are necessary in the scope that is necessary for the successful and effective conduct of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this agreement , in particular determine how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied .
supplementary agreements can be extended or altered without alter@@ ing the agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report outlined in article 62 , the organization provides a summari@@ zed inventory of the entire core material underlying this Convention , regardless of its origin , and carries out this inventory list based on the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other
the E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference on international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource @-@ transfer problems .
C ) It is the purpose of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force is issued in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bind@@ ings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the E@@ EC has submitted a table from which it is clear in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; Rep@@ ac@@ tional account , &quot; which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special transaction ; this account is managed by the organization as administrator and used ( in this property the organization is referred to as the &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic notes of the member state , which are to be paid in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the car@@ et@@ aker of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another date agreed upon by the E@@ EC and the bai@@ li@@ ff , taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any member state may , upon request , make payments before the above mentioned dates .
according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker assumes approximately proportional charges on the cash or the school @-@ dsch@@ eine in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
when granting this loan , the car@@ et@@ aker can be derived from the following factors in accordance with the E@@ EC conditions :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without dis@@ counted ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each lending institution serves the financing of a clearly defined and rapidly equ@@ itable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral plan ) , which is considered , approved , approved and managed in accordance with the procedures and practices that apply to this agreement named b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of regular funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force .
apart from Section 4 , special re@@ payment terms are subject to the same re@@ payment terms , which are generally applicable to the institution granted by the organization ; they are therefore ref@@ und@@ able in the course of ten free years each in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts to pay for this watch must be made directly to the organization that it reserves .
each lending institution must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in particular the origin of the means is indicated .
revenues from each lending institution may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or services ( ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization , and which , according to the measure of what the car@@ et@@ aker has specified at the time of loan guarantee , could be the bene@@ fici@@ ary of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible to transfer from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State concerned .
the administrator shall instruc@@ t the E@@ EC for the full disclosure of all the special transactions issued by the directors in preparation , and through the projects and programs approved by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the E@@ EC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenditure made for this purpose .
the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the special transaction with a statement from the external audi@@ tors of the organization to this Statement .
after full payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator of the E@@ EC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction .
the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , resulting from the accounts payable on the account , and the amounts paid out of the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker cooperate closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator through to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction , the progress of programmes or projects financed by the transaction gaps and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on December 31 , 1978 or at a later date , which the E@@ EC and the organization may agree , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately .
if the total amount of funds made by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Member States governments write down the decision of the procedure to the general sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ retariat holds these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the E@@ EC to the organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned Noti@@ fications of the organization .
this agreement is written in two signatures in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wor@@ ding being equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of an exchange of letters to change the Anne@@ x A protocol to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - HA@@ T issue the following :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot;
and the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Federal Council , &quot;
this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the JET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to as the &quot; common company JET &quot; after Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty .
Switzerland has been working with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
since up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is still to be carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum@@ mar@@ ise their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to speed up their respective research projects which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis .
this agreement is intended to enable each contracting party to take the greatest possible benefit by combining their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided by both sides of research , i.e. the cost @-@ compliant electricity generation by using the controlled core fusion reaction .
to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties are associ@@ ating their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss Programme . &quot;
in order to guarantee effective co @-@ operation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of the cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it is thus extended or modified in accordance with the bodies mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement to include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
every time the parties accept a new program , this is due to the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II to the programs listed in Anne@@ x I and II .
the association appointed in paragraph 1 is carried out by : - Ap@@ propri@@ ate participation of each of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
- The exchange of personnel among the relevant laboratories in Eur@@ atom &apos;s member states , in Switzerland and in the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ;
- mutual right to access the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
in the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the JET .
in view of the association agreement envis@@ aged in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those who are called &quot; Associ@@ ated Institu@@ tions , &quot; herein@@ after called &quot; Associ@@ ated Institu@@ tions , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme .
with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland will participate in the agreement on the promotion of human resources , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ iz@@ ations , herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; Agreement on Human Resources . &quot;
with regard to the participation in the JET L , Switzerland is part of the communal business JET whose constitution is accepted by the time of the entry into force of the present agreement .
moreover , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland may become the contractual partner of any contract , whose goal is to fall within the framework of the present agreement , except association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association specified in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and the Association Agreement .
the association agreement must , in particular , include the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat .
- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible outcomes in line with the goals of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom programme - herein@@ after referred to as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all questions concerning the current or planned programs and activities within the Eur@@ atom programme , is taking this task in view of all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ iz@@ ations and focuses on the mutual objective set out in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common objective set out in Article 1 of the present agreement , with respect to the scientific and technological developments emerging in the world .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the competent Swiss authorities request it .
the Advisory Group , which provides the VG research proposals with the aim of providing the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task in terms of all research and development work referred to in this agreement .
Switzerland is represented in the committee of directors appointed by the Eur@@ atom programme by the director of one of the participating laboratories .
the committee of directors responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and who is responsible for the best use of the capacities of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , is fu@@ elling this task in terms of all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
in particular , it ensures the best possible use of the personnel and the exchange of the same between the laboratories , which are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss program .
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the sessions of all the coordin@@ ating committees deployed within the Eur@@ atom programme .
the coordination committees , which provide the committee of directors with appropriate proposals for the best use of the means , the personnel as well as the knowledge and skills involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement .
the BA@@ F is a representative of every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and all associated third countries responsible for the core and energy research .
at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission on the implementation of the programme and any changes in the exec@@ utions as well as the preparation of the future programmes and the establishment of its overall scope , coordination and integration of national activities at community level in the field of fusion .
the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the consulting groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character .
VG &apos;s position on the urgent actions is compulsory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of both parties shall work on the work of all technical advisory committees or all administrative bodies , which are created for the purpose of the present agreement .
the financial contribution of Switzerland to the Eur@@ atom programme in accordance with this agreement is set annually to an amount that is at the cost of Eur@@ atom &apos;s Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Switzerland to the whole gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
regarding the project JET , this contribution to the contribution of Eur@@ atom to the common company as soon as it is built .
in addition , Switzerland over@@ points the common company JET an amount that is determined according to the Stat@@ ute of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Enterprise .
the financial contribution that Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of works within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange is calculated on the same basis , which is usually used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to finance the works that are made due to the corresponding contracts .
the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year , which amount will be allocated to cover the issues within the Eur@@ atom programme for the relevant year .
the Federal Council will pay the commission the amount due to this Article , as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are set in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .

it enters into force when the parties have communicated to one another that the necessary procedures have been carried out .
this agreement will be closed for the duration of the Eur@@ atom programme outlined in Article 1 ; it will be sil@@ ently extended in line with further relevant application decisions of Eur@@ atom .
if such a further program decision is passed , the extension for the duration of the new programme , which replaces the Eur@@ atom programme outlined in App@@ endi@@ x I , is considered not to be terminated if there are only delays in the adoption of another Eur@@ atom programme .
before each decision on adop@@ ting a new Eur@@ atom programme , the contractual parties are consul@@ ted within the scope of the present agreement mentioned in articles 5 to 10 and articles 16 .
any contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement at any time , subject to a six @-@ month deadline .
in the form of an exchange of letters to am@@ end the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation
in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the case of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contractual parties in the future , it appears further indicated to include in the agreement an article 12 to record .
I teach you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for entry into force 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above .
I teach you to confirm the receipt of your letter today with the following wor@@ ding :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the Member States &apos; demands as part of the medium @-@ term financial state
the BI@@ S could close Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks provide a corresponding application .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of contributions paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery charges for the member countries .
already , however , here@@ after some conditions have been called which the BI@@ S would be willing to apply .
in each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but not exceeding five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as with the possible extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening vision .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing was not made before the end of a month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ stlich der Uruguay concerning the trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb meat
I teach to take the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat .
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff area 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common customs tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( tari@@ ff area 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common customs tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are set to the following annual amounts :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the quantity specified in fact exceeds the agreed amount and is carried out in accordance with the traditional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) .
if a change in the form of supply is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this Agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee mentioned under Number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community takes up the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to the Community market regulated by this agreement does not affect the Community market .
in the event that Uruguay imports exceed the agreed quantities in a year , the community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the import of the products collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ist set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with Uruguay changes the amount set by number 2 according to the scope of Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with every new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the rules of the Acc@@ ession agreement ; this will take account of the ho@@ ist rate mentioned under the number 5 of the exhaus@@ tion .
the total quantity listed under number 2 is set to 5 800 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight by the day of the accession of Greece to the Community .
the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development that could affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat on the community market within the agreed quantities .
in particular , the Community finds provisions in order to prevent the sale of defici@@ encies in frozen meat as a result of the implementation of the Regulation on the sale of Urugu@@ ay@@ an sheep .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of funds or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb , as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , takes place only at prices and conditions , which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community in world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the Convention for interpretation and application of the Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by providing export lic@@ ences defined in this agreement for the products mentioned under number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Community , on its part , comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in Uruguay is subject to the submission of an export license which is issued by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in implementing provisions , it is also stipul@@ ated that the responsible Urugu@@ ay@@ an authority noti@@ fies the authorities in regular intervals that export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these details may be en@@ coded in accordance with the country &apos;s destination .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the contract is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of East of Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement are reviewed by the two parties prior to 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .

the Parties to the European Convention on 15 December 1958 concerning the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Con@@ ventions &quot; ) -
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Parties shall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meet all necessary measures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to liber@@ ate the therapeutic substances made available to them by the other parties of human origin from all input charges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community the obligation to grant this release falls into the competence of the community based on the treaty by which it was founded , which has the necessary powers to do so ;
whereas it is necessary to carry out Article 5 , paragraph 1 of the Convention , that the European Economic Community can become a contracting party of the Convention -
the Convention enters into force on the first day of the month following signature .
it enters into force on the first day of the month , following the day when the last of the parties has left their acceptance certificate to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
( 2 ) This Additional Protocol , however , occurs after the exp@@ ir@@ ation of two years after the date in force to which it was issued for acceptance , unless one of the parties has notified a objection to its entry into force .
from this point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention without becoming the contracting party of the Additional Protocol .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies Member States of the Council of Europe , all States and the European Economic Community every assumption or objection within the meaning of Article 2 , as well as the timing of the entry into force of this Additional Protocol ( Article 2 ) .
the Secretary @-@ General also notes the European Economic Community any action , notification or communication related to this Convention .
whereas Member States in the spirit of European solidarity support each other in the procurement of re@@ agents for the identification of blood group , it is highly desirable .
whereas this mutual support is only possible if the condition and use of these re@@ agents for the determination of blood is jointly submitted by the Member States and granted the necessary facil@@ itation and exemp@@ tions for their import@@ ation -
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the sense of this convention , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for the determination of blood type and to determine blood in@@ compatibility . &quot; &quot; &quot;
any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention on re@@ agents of human origin to the blood group determination when signing this Convention or laying down their rati@@ fication , appro@@ vals , or accession documents to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the declaration can be withdrawn at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
the contractual parties undertake to leave re@@ agents for the determination of the cost of their extraction , preparation and transport , as well as the purchase price of other contractual parties , which are in urgent need of them , provided they themselves have sufficient supplies for their own needs .
re@@ agents for the determination of the blood type are made available to other parties only on the condition that there is no profit , that they are only used for medical purposes and are only supplied to places designated by the governments involved .
each consi@@ gn@@ ment of re@@ agents to the blood group determination must be accompanied by a certificate that they were produced in accordance with the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its facility constitute an Administr@@ ative Agreement , which may be am@@ ended or am@@ ended by the governments of the contracting parties of the Convention .
the parties shall take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents provided to them by other contractual parties to determine the blood group determination of all input charges .
they also take all necessary measures to ensure that these substances prec@@ lu@@ de the recipients in Article 3 quickly and in the shortest possible way .
the parties shall submit a list of places to each other on the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe , which are authorised to issue the certificate provided in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with the places designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe for signature ; they can become a contracting party ( by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or
this Convention enters into force a month after the day in which three members of the Council have signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it pursuant to Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .
for any member who signs or appro@@ ves or appro@@ ves this Agreement later without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it enters into force a month after its signature or the deposit of the rati@@ fication or approval certificate .
following the entry into force of the Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe may invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the Advisory States a ) the date of the entry into force of the Convention and the names of the members who signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
each contracting party may termin@@ ate this agreement with an announcement to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe following a period of one year .
a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen , which is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or symptoms may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be analyzed .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum fer@@ til@@ iser in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated only in volume of the blood cell in@@ fill in the total volume .
for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ completely anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood type determination , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are worked out at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ffer , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te floods .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mix within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood type determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ exhaus@@ tive anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in comparison to the international standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International units ( see Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B S@@ ears , according to definition , contain 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available for free from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tre of the International Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its properties should remain intact for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in fluid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents on the label is based on the results of the shelf @-@ life tests ; it must be approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0,5 l of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or @-@ pent@@ oxy@@ de at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority can determine that the agent ( or solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the re@@ agent remains the pre@@ conditions for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origins for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in fluid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
as far as possible , the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange should not be arti@@ ficially colored , at least as long as there is no international agreement on a uniform system .
re@@ agents for blood type determination are to be distributed in such a way that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount needed in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records on all stages of production and control of the re@@ agents to determine the blood type determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents have to be stored long from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group determination can contain substances of human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective portion , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the source of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents can contain no substances of human origin .
a black @-@ and @-@ white label can be attached to each individual container in English and French containing the following information : 1 . manufacturer &apos;s name and address ,
4 . quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
in addition , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers include the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3 . quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
each consi@@ gn@@ ment must be enclosed in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention according to the Anne@@ x to this protocol .

in no case , the effectiveness of the serum should not be less than 64 international units per ml .
un@@ dil@@ uted anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) blood serum must also cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x group ( A@@ x or A@@ o ) .
if an anti @-@ A + anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10@@ percent floods of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required when the same tests are carried out with the repeated but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group serum or with a standard preparation of the same activity .

the following requirements regarding the effectiveness of Ser@@ a to determine the R@@ h Group may be subject to change if International Standard Prepar@@ ations are available . ( i ) Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more individuals who are immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen D .
