<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report outlined in article 62, the organization provides a summarized inventory of the entire core material underlying this Convention, regardless of its origin, and carries out this inventory list based on the following reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the conference on international economic cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource-transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the purpose of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months after the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force is issued in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bindings to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC has submitted a table from which it is clear in which way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the name "Repactional account," which consists of the funds that the member states contribute to the special transaction; this account is managed by the organization as administrator and used (in this property the organization is referred to as the "caretaker"), and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) The payment is made in the form of cash or intrinsic notes of the member state, which are to be paid in the currency of the respective state at the order of the organization as the caretaker of the special transaction account and to be deposited at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) The payment is made in two installments, and the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the entry within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or another between the EEC and the caretaker agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or another date agreed upon by the EEC and the bailiff, taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any member state may, upon request, make payments before the above mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">According to the usual procedures of the organization, the caretaker assumes approximately proportional charges on the cash or the school-dscheine in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting this loan, the caretaker can be derived from the following factors in accordance with the EEC conditions:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) of the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without discounted; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the extent to which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each lending institution serves the financing of a clearly defined and rapidly equitable development program or project (including a sectoral plan), which is considered, approved, approved and managed in accordance with the procedures and practices that apply to this agreement named b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of regular funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the organization which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the organization on the day of the entry into force.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special repayment terms are subject to the same repayment terms, which are generally applicable to the institution granted by the organization; they are therefore refundable in the course of ten free years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay for this watch must be made directly to the organization that it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each lending institution must be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the caretaker, in particular the origin of the means is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">Revenues from each lending institution may be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or services (ii) in developing countries, the members of the organization, and which, according to the measure of what the caretaker has specified at the time of loan guarantee, could be the beneficiary of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transaction loans take place on the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is as soon as possible to transfer from the caretaker to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">The administrator shall instruct the EEC for the full disclosure of all the special transactions issued by the directors in preparation, and through the projects and programs approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of payment of the special transaction loans, the caretaker teaches the EEC quarterly on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenditure made for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">The administrator transfers the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization a detailed billing of the special transaction with a statement from the external auditors of the organization to this Statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loans, the administrator of the EEC reports as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="757">The caretaker creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, resulting from the accounts payable on the account, and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretaker cooperate closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator through to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction, the progress of programmes or projects financed by the transaction gaps and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on December 31, 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the organization may agree, the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of funds made by the recipients is repaid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the procedural provisions of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The Member States governments write down the decision of the procedure to the general secretariat of the Council of the European Communities.</seg>
