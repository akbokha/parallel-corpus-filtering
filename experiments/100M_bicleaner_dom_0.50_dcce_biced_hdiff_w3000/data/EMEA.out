this document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) judged the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. whi@@ r@@ ling thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternate with periods of normal tuning .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used to quickly control increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for intake or the melt tablets in patients who difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , who are just as abili@@ fy as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adapted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of neur@@ ons to one another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole probably works primarily as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , acts to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to normal@@ ise the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to a year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , with which of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the processed tablets and the solution to take in ( absor@@ bs ) .
in the two trials with the injection solution patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed significantly greater ease in the symptoms of increased anxiety than those receiving placebo .
during the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short @-@ time studies than placebo .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy effectively prevented the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15@@ mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo for the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for intake ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controll@@ able itch ) , nausea , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , nausea , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased sali@@ vary ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the Ben@@ ef@@ its of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes correspon@@ ded to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in addition , the committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution were out@@ weighed by increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for placing Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union .
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a daily maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the appearance of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ot@@ eric and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , you should consider reducing the dose or canc@@ elling the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a M@@ NS or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years old with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
however , there were in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no accurate risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ poles , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combined bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans , the joint application with high @-@ acting inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 results in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ isi@@ ers .
if one considers the common application of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ op@@ meth@@ morph@@ ine / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( d@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ ism ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the lack of data for safety in humans and because of the concerns raised in reproductive studies at the animal , unless the potential benefits clearly justi@@ fies the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total reduced incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ac@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lan@@ t@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosing with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is useful in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma retention .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder leads to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic action on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recept@@ ors .
the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction of binding of 11@@ C rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D@@ 2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ cus and on the put@@ ty .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who were attending the study medi@@ cation were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly greater improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in the incidence of recur@@ rence , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , among significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole demonstrated a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia like lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features that partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole for extensive metabol@@ isi@@ es via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
at Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , as well as a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics gave no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the eth@@ ni@@ city or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ bo@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the potential for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent low @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times of the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ ra@@ zo@@ l at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold Mid@@ west @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a daily maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day , regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can use the processed tablets alternatively to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder leads to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic action on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , among significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were compared to the intake of 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 In addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold Mid@@ west @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ce with oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy processed tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were different than caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure decrease ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including ac@@ ot@@ eric and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifest@@ ations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ poles , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to combined bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15@@ mg dosage ) was used as a single @-@ use intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly , and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) received intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , although this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans , the joint application with high @-@ acting inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 may result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg doses ) were intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials with oral Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
during the long @-@ term study of 26 weeks during a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ phosph@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements of ag@@ gregation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared with placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 hours ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of ap@@ athy and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - Reference arm .
the mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population , but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ dents who attended the study medication were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measured scales , which were defined as secondary study objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate scale , showed significantly greater improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia a significantly higher reduction in the incidence of recur@@ rence , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double blind study involving schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks that included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C after the dose of the same dose as tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 trials with healthy volunteers , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration of systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - or 5 times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety concerns about mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the potential for carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
effects included a dose @-@ dependent low @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the central steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had been associated with anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
considering only those who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsen@@ ing of the disease and survival .
patients who had previously received other treatments from their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel .
patients may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood prior to treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with the first treatment , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel , and that in contrast to other medicines contained in pac@@ lit@@ axel , it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the marketing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensor@@ ine@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function have been carried out and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel once again .
in patients no new treatment courses should be initiated until neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cytes is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly linked cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac ab@@ norm@@ alities in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
in case of nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not have effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able .
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised to not produce a child for up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm con@@ serving prior to treatment , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible inf@@ alli@@ bility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( frequent ) , which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and significant incidents of side effects reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most conspic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was rapidly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no caus@@ al relationship with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an an@@ tim@@ kr@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the con@@ tainment of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular mes@@ h@@ work , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ d@@ endo@@ theli@@ al transport is conveyed by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ in receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation in the area of the tumor because of the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ret@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm un@@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received a pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy every three weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 without pre@@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously not received chemotherapy ; 27 % only had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % for metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy degrees 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for the decay of bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials .
the drug exposure exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ arity distribution and / or soft tissue binding of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane were compared with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) than with solvent @-@ based pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is primarily met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative urine secre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light of light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and , as with other potentially toxic substances , be respected when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , we are inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into an Abra@@ x@@ ane gas bottle .
after complete en@@ core of the solution , the cup should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the water bottle should be swi@@ vel@@ ed slowly and carefully for at least 2 minutes and / or inver@@ ted until a complete suspension of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ uses are visible , the water @-@ through bottle must be inver@@ ted again gently , in order to achieve complete res@@ us@@ suspension before application .
the total dose of the 5 mg / ml @-@ suspension required for the patient is calculated and the corresponding amount of re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

member states must ensure that the propriet@@ or &apos;s approval for placing on the market before the market launch provides the medical specialist in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training bro@@ sch@@ ure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , lab@@ eling and packing insert . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , cold boxes intended for transport by the patients .
this means that se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicines &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood @-@ iron values , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be taken under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his super@@ visor , provided that they have received appropriate guidance .
in patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ ine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enabled it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the case of an injection into a vein , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference resin device in a main study with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin @-@ spra@@ yed ab@@ se@@ amed treated with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney problems , patients with hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in were maintained in the same degree as those receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients receiving E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the bas@@ eline value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally leads to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ ra@@ ine headaches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the European Union regulations the evidence has shown that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces se@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce Dru@@ gs P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed in the entire European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ors , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia during chemotherapy onset ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in planned larger surgical interventions involving a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood among women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed may be used before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may be applied , which cannot participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients , in which the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and as a consequence may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; therefore , an assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by over 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in one patient over or below the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the sustained ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is 25 % reduced .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and - follow @-@ up may vary depending on age , sex and total disease burden ; this is why an assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor .
given this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control the initial symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l opposite the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis increased to &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
in contrast , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ sis increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood c@@ anned foods is required , ab@@ se@@ amed should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible , e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation programme begins , so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each in 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine into the circulation .
patients suffering from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) .
in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in a aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently established cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely was reported about the appearance of an an@@ tigen @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of efficacy , defined as reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes should be investigated for non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ation , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value is reduced ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the plat@@ el@@ et cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other reason of a loss of action is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended under paragraph 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required for controlling the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically @-@ evident coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended under paragraph 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in patients with chemotherapy , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should consider a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin responses ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the h@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ a@@ emia ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take account of the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo a greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine was not demonstrated to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 @-@ 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in@@ dose can be adjusted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro investigations on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , ery@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsen@@ ing of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can result in th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the genetically generated epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ lic@@ ated and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content is identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of infected patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not influence leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression were examined in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients with an@@ a@@ emia due to a number of common malign@@ ancies consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality than in controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa @-@ regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly longer half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved by intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated for three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal experimental studies involving approximately 20 times the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to decreased di@@ lu@@ te body weight , a delay in the oscill@@ ation and an increase in the mat@@ ernal mortality rate .
these reports are based on in vitro fer@@ til@@ isation with cells of human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

• In a month before your treatment , you may have suffered a heart attack or a stroke • if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time ever occurring or increased chest pain ) • the risk of blood cl@@ ots in the veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - for example , if such a blood cl@@ ots have occurred before you .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial occ@@ lu@@ sion ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disorder ) .
during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ forms in further treatment .
your doctor will , if necessary , perform regular blood checks to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be considered and treated before beginning treatment with se@@ amed .
the incidence of ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a con@@ ges@@ tion after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin was reported very rarely .
if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor may consider dis@@ continuation of the treatment with se@@ amed until the potassium values lie again in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion marks due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the latest findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is still not di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 - 3 week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for assessing the effectiveness of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood @-@ dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dosage accordingly to minimize the risk of coron@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past already th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that se@@ amed acts like a growth factor for blood cells , and under certain circumstances may affect the tumor .
if a major orthop@@ edic surgery is about to happen , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated appropriately before the start of treatment .
if your values of the red blood @-@ color@@ ant ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ p formation after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used them , even if they are not prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may request certain blood checks to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory investigations have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are agents for the development of the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or in HIV ) .
depending on how your blood sugar ( an@@ a@@ emia ) responds to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment success and ensure that the medicine works correctly and your hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread to two equally large inj@@ ections .

ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( swelling o@@ ede@@ ma ) and shock allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat feeling and accelerated pulse were reported in rare cases .
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Speci@@ fic caution when applying ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it may come - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic frac@@ ture as with the H@@ inf@@ alle ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50@@ 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or obtained by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce symptoms of fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache in the three days following the in@@ fusion .
for the treatment of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was studied over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in the serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood returned to normal levels or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with elderly women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ la@@ sta occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to cit@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ la@@ sta provides information material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited Company to obtain authorisation for the transport of Ac@@ la@@ sta across the European Union .

the Patient Information Package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Con@@ tra @-@ indications in pregnancy and breast@@ feeding women • Re@@ quired of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing help
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic oste@@ opor@@ osis frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with low @-@ trau@@ matic oste@@ o@@ arthritis , the administration of the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended for two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic oste@@ o@@ arthritis , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as a limited clinical experience exists for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary since bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination are similar to younger patients .
children and teenagers Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , as data for safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ en@@ ia therapy must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid setting of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ en@@ ia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
for patients who need dental en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments , no data is available , if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw@@ s area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for each patient &apos;s treatment plan and are based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation in patients who received Ac@@ la@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial ) .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which manifested as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured every year prior to administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were in a clinical trial for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal oscill@@ ation range ( less than 2.6 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , reached 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently developed hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of co@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw@@ s area has been broad@@ ly reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including cit@@ ric acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw@@ s area with an ac@@ la@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo .
in case of over@@ dose , which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , a dose of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for three consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) T @-@ score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ neck as ≤ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric curves Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the incidence of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % lower risk for spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta demonstrated a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density on the lum@@ bar spine , hips and dist@@ al radius compared with the placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 In@@ cre@@ ase of lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6,@@ 0 % , the lower spine by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius of 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third yearly dose bone biop@@ si@@ es were taken from the pel@@ vic slu@@ dge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture in patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pe@@ p@@ ti@@ d of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum was determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periodi@@ c intervals during study duration .
treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months significantly by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline value and was held at 28 % below the initial value to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment increased BM@@ D at all times .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % compared to the placebo treatment at 5.@@ 4 % in total waste and 4,@@ 3 % on the neck neck .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study C@@ ZO@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior compared to the once weekly administration of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , especially light to moder@@ ately heavy disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum level of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ x to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron once a day for 2 months has been proven in two six months comparison studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta and 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta was maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be a dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life time t ½ a 0,@@ 24 and t ½ h 1,@@ 87 hours , followed by a long eli@@ oration phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the t ½ -@@ values above ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ Clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h irrespective of the dose and remains un@@ affected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion @-@ time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration at 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentrations against time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chro@@ mium @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ei@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolism @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of C@@ ol@@ ei@@ c Aci@@ d cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function disorder right down to a cre@@ atine @-@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ei@@ ron@@ c acid .
because for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
in studies in dogs , single doses of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub @-@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al tolerance of Z@@ ol@@ ei@@ ron@@ c acid in rats was determined by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) , well tolerated .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to accumulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects on other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection site were observed .
the most frequent findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive action of the substance .
rats observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum @-@ calcium levels .
if the drug is not immediately used , the user is responsible for storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .

Ris@@ ko Management Plan The propriet@@ or of approval for placing on the market is obliged to carry out studies and additional activities related to the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance approved in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all following R@@ MP approved versions of the R@@ MP .
according to the CH@@ MP guidelines for risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information may be disclosed , which may affect the current statements on safety , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) has been reached .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a group of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , mainly est@@ ro@@ gens formed by and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men .
in the case of Pa@@ get &apos;s disease , bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone structure weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta does work by norm@@ alizing the bone structure again , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation , giving strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / apply , even if they are not prescription drugs .
for your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drinks , you are concerned that you have sufficient fluids in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to take Ac@@ la@@ sta 2 or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta does work for a long time , you may need a further dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if you missed the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before termin@@ ating the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering completing the treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take your next physician &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .
physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported above all in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves , and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) were reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or you notice side effects not listed in this use information .
if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions to the application ; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic oste@@ o@@ arthritis are advised to undertake the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta 2 or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
because of the rapid setting of the effect of cit@@ ric acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic oste@@ o@@ arthritis , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients • who suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above or • which are overweight ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond and beyond one or more I
in addition , four studies were performed on more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used compared to placebo for supporting smoking .
on the other hand , studies aimed at setting smoking did not show consistent results , so the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia on this field of application was difficult to estimate .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? the most common side effects observed during studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and upper respiratory tract infection .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it may increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others for a small minority of patients .
caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or i@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of applying HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( Anti@@ biotics ) .

A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in the case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the use of treatment in an individual case prev@@ ails the risk ( see Section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
depres@@ sive reactions can also occur in patients who - besides obesity - have no apparent risks .
relatives or other close relatives are to point out that it is necessary to monitor the occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown adequately .

abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , explaining how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly obes@@ e patients ) who cannot be employed satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; this should reduce the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured .
ac@@ tos led to lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg doses .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy trial , the effect of an additional administration of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin had a 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin had a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common adverse events associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , still in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in , in which met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval for Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see Section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years , so the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients whose presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) is at risk of developing a compens@@ ating heart failure , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually .
patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac safety .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
in this study there was an increase in reports of heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ stomach upset , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be conducted until the laboratory parameters have been evaluated by clinical evaluation .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been demonstrated , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3,@@ 6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients with sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two @-@ fold or triple @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after market introduction , treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , reported a decrease in visual acuity in diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking pic@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma if patients report about disturbances of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events on bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind , clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ cation .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be dis@@ continued ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies to investigate the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that , in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin resistance produced in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal decreased , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; isolated cases : unknown ( from this data is not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the lens and the index of refra@@ ction of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege were often referred to as placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency was 1.6 % higher than placebo , when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w respectively .
since the market launch it was rarely reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients were conducted in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ cation .
in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ cation .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ gin@@ gi@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimisation with insulin was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those receiving insulin . a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ al values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was studied in a small , 18 week examination of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical trials , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and a minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL cholesterol was observed in most clinical trials .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plasma @-@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ lin@@ cide and increased HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison with placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ lin@@ cide reduced levels were observed .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved post@@ lu@@ cent elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups that received either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
according to oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , with top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma , usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to effectiveness in approximately three times the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
interaction studies have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the wood ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma @-@ exclusion period of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral Clear@@ ance of the mother substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys agreed after repeated ad@@ minist@@ ering plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that in treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in gest@@ ation and increased insulin resistance of the mat@@ ernal animal decreased , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) elevated in@@ dences of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ans led to an increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared with 23 / 90@@ 5 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ cation .
in another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were studied with either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ lin@@ cide .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ al values .
in a study over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the ni@@ b@@ light tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ lu@@ cent elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride levels , this both via an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study had missed the goal of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ arization and vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks .
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane lead to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels which indicated that blood sugar levels were similarly reduced to another human insulin .
acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
in addition , acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane cans may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks associated with diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transfer of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane to the entire European Union .
pre@@ mixed insulin products are normally used once or twice a day if a rapid initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy can alter the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast @-@ acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin in animal origin ) may result in a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken from them .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can however develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an experienced help or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total effective duration is up to 24 hours .
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile lies in the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .

acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin in human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
in addition , acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id doses may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transfer of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id to the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of fast @-@ acting insulin must be re@@ plen@@ ished , followed by the amount of insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change .
before travelling , which go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration of the administration - local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Whi@@ le insulin therapy may cause local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an experienced help or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical interventions showed that an intraven@@ ous acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id decreased mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total effective duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .
in@@ fusion systems with acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id in concentrations 0.@@ 05 I.@@ E. / ml - 1.0 I.@@ E. / ml insulin in human in@@ fusion fluids : 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de , 5 % D @-@ glucose and 10 % tin glucose with 40 m@@ mo@@ l / l potassium chlori@@ de are stable at room temperature for 24 hours at room temperature .
11 If a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary in the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
before travelling , which go through several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times .

this can happen : if you are inj@@ ected too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you are more than otherwise physically challenged
always set the sealing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let production pens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the sealing cap with a medical t@@ amp@@ er • Do not always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle . remove the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure proper dosage : • Hold up Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger against the cartridge .
if air bubbles are present , they will accumulate at the top of the cartridge • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues to move up , turn the cartridge around one click ( Fig@@ ure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues pointing upwards , press the pressure button in all ( Fig@@ ure C ) • Now you have to squee@@ ze a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Connect the cap back to the finished pen so that the digit is 0 compared to the dosing mark ( Fig@@ ure D ) • Check that the push button is fully pressed .
if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle . the scale on the cap displays 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push button moves outward , while turning the cap off • The scale under the pressure button ( push@@ button dial ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Place the highest number you can see on the press stud • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or backward until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
turn them until the push button is at the bottom and you feel a resistance , then take the cap and place them in such a way that the 0 of the dosing mark is opposite .
make sure to press the press button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the pressure button down after the injection until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not adjust a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the quantity scale to assess how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of cryst@@ alli@@ zation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ out k@@ not ( &quot; stones , &quot; which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there are still cases of rheum@@ atism ; therefore it is recommended that patients at least during the first six months under treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic are still taking further medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks .
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , which included 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ omas ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( pseu@@ do@@ drug ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug used for hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of aden@@ omas ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for one year .
in both studies , allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems only received 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once received 120 mg once a day in the last three measurements showed a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was the case with 22 % ( 60 out of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of aden@@ omas ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that aden@@ ur@@ ic could be more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could be a higher risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ ate deposits ( including a present or current present in the medical history and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x can be considered daily .
efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated in patients with severe kidney function restriction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or abnormal heart failure the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other acid @-@ seed medicines , acute g@@ out occurs during the treatment of treatment because of the reduction of the serum resin acid level , ur@@ ic acid deposits can initially be mobil@@ ised in the tissue .
B. in rare cases , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3,5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before beginning of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis treatment and in the course of the course ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ war did not have any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ite mirror ( a blocking of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study with subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x per day had an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al correlation with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were ar@@ teri@@ os@@ kler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that may arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which have been reported in all f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once are listed below .
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated at the same time as Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Open long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 90@@ 6 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years .
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ - treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all in pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency :
diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ not@@ es@@ thesia , show@@ y EC@@ G , cou@@ ghing , short@@ ness of skin , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , erectile dysfunction , increase in levels of potassium in the blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells .
the active mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ in@@ metabolism in humans and results in the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid reaction process .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) inhibit@@ or with a K@@ i value for the in vitro inhibit@@ or , which lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( A@@ PE@@ X study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month @-@ specific serum acid levels &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were present .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the A@@ PE@@ X study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x per day as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional doses of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x per day as well as with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to conventional treatment with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were sum@@ mar@@ ised for analysis . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering the serum resin saw cone to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cholesterol levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The A@@ PE@@ X study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( ie .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C received the primary efficacy end@@ point of 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there was no clin@@ ically significant difference in the percentage decrease of the serum resin concentrations in subjects , despite their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum resin @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
the data from the Phase 3 open el@@ ong@@ ation study showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in less than 3 % of patients required in the months of 16 to 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the corne@@ a , which resulted in 54 % of patients a complete disappearance of the top grades up to 24 months .
increased SH@@ A values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ W / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional .
doses between 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at an increase in the AU@@ C , which is larger than the dose proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x is about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum resin acid concentration was observed , provided that was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is from 29 to 75 litres after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver microphones , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are predominantly made by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide is mainly caused by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after intake of an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine found itself as un@@ changing F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stools were found as unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patient groups kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average total AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times of 7.5 μ of maturity / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13,@@ 2 μ Met@@ amorph@@ op@@ h / ml in the group with severe kidney cancer function .
12 Li@@ ver restriction after intake of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) Li@@ ver function restriction changed the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after intake of multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4,@@ 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .

in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the crystal formation is prevented and in this way , a reduction in the symptoms is achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C must not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
inform your doctor before you start taking this drug • if you have a heart weakness or have or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are suffering from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in the wake of a cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han @-@ Syn@@ dro@@ ms ( a rare con@@ genital disease in which there is too much ur@@ ic acid in the blood ) .
if you have a g@@ out attack at the moment ( sudden occurrence of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the plaster fall is cleared before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
this does not have to be the case with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a g@@ out attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used them , even if they are not prescription drugs .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding increasing vitamin D levels .
after 15 weeks of treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those who only took Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE meets the exact dose required to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) , and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , ul@@ cers ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , beaten abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) and aci@@ dic sensation .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it should not be applied in cases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. for placing AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE on the whole of the European Union .
capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following guidelines are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
• Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lay down before the first food intake of the day , which is supposed to take 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplas@@ tic , only under special caution ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al cords , were reported in patients under the seizure of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out in the occurrence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation like dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ stern@@ al pain or a new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn of the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe ga@@ stro @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after symptoms associated with es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some serious and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ mens contains mainly IV @-@ administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the onset of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure reduce the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning with a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases which affect mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may interfere with the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ osis of the jaw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports were reported by cancer patients , but it was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the sera phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ kal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ol to vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of vitamin D@@ 3 is the rise of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as the regulation of serum calcium , the ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone resor@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency may lead to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al mus@@ cul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al ac@@ ia , and thus to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

after 15 weeks of treatment the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the group under AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) decreased significantly after 15 weeks the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III trials , the mean BM@@ D increases with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur neck and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more spinal frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D continued from the spinal column and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter ; the BM@@ D of the fem@@ oral neck and the whole body was also maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least a new flu@@ e frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption on an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before starting a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the mean of 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies of rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly disper@@ sed into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radioactive substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic Clear@@ ance exceeded 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other drugs is influenced by these transport systems .
resor@@ ption In healthy adult subjects ( women and men ) after ni@@ ghtly fasting and two hours before taking a meal the middle area was below the serum concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 120 h ) for vitamin D@@ 3 29@@ 6.@@ 4 ng • h / ml ( excluding endo@@ genous vitamin D@@ 3 levels ) .
the mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ MA@@ x ) of vitamin D@@ 3 was 5.@@ 9 ng / ml and the medi@@ an time up to the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
vitamin D@@ 3 is rapidly converted into 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ xy D@@ 3 in the liver and is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 1,@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ d@@ 3 in the kidney .
ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in healthy subjects was the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours 2.4 % , in the f@@ ences after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for patients with reduced kidney function , an increased accumulation of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bones can be expected ( see section 4.2 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adv@@ agra@@ f &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent transplan@@ ted organ rejection by the immune system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ ft / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a period of treatment of one year ( by examining , for example , a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
trem@@ ors , headaches , nausea , vom@@ iting , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar level ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hyper@@ emia ) , high blood pressure ( hypertension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other ingredients , advocate must@@ n &apos;t be used .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken concur@@ r@@ ently with Adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or dose of the medication taken concur@@ r@@ ently needs to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
following a change@@ over to an alternative formulation , therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; below ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level mirrors should be controlled before switching over and over two weeks after change@@ over .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both in both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ care phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ances , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ ph can scheme may take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition in the first post @-@ operative phase does not allow oral intake of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate can be induced to produce an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dose recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary later , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after transplantation .
dose recommendations - Li@@ ver transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f M@@ ust must be converted from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f Cap@@ sul@@ es to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) has to be done in relation to the entire daily dose .
kidney and liver transplan@@ t After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to adv@@ ant once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
an oral initiation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily in the case of adult patients who are converted to Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ ant in lung , p@@ ank@@ reas@@ - and gut @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , Pro@@ gra@@ f was applied in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in patients with transplan@@ ted transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dose adjustments in special patient groups with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
patients with reduced kidney function As the ren@@ al function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the serum cre@@ atine capsule , a calculation of the cre@@ atine capsule , and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f In switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in- to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred @-@ Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or by using substances which could change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the valley levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus during the first time after liver transplan@@ ts are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with transplan@@ t and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; Modification of the formulation or ré@@ gi@@ me should only be performed under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 In order to treat adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be effective against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients .
due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may be avoided ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions due to appropriate clothing or use of suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who are taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus have symptoms for PRE@@ S such as headache , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
as Adv@@ agra@@ ph Hard@@ worms , ret@@ arded , lac@@ tose present , special caution is required for patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage to maintain constant concentrations accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al drugs such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ id antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the level of hormone levels , decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures must be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially decreases the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and Phen@@ az@@ one and prolon@@ gs its half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients are not suggest@@ ing that , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ ine of the new@@ born ( incidence of 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not exactly determined because of the patient &apos;s disease and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

infection and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients who are treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ otic , proto@@ zo@@ a ) is often increased .
cases of BK @-@ Virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported about ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
because of its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At a molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ an protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cellular interior .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ atic inhibit@@ ing of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , as well as the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported which received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic corneal gra@@ ft rejection , the ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year following the transplan@@ t ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus@@ - and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ pon@@ et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , in 2@@ 1,7 % of the cases of ob@@ liter@@ ans of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was significantly higher ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) of patients with the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Group ( Tre@@ k et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
a multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients , who at the same time underwent pancre@@ as and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ized method of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initiation dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired level levels from 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts showed an actual survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of 10 and 15 ng / ml and more recently transplan@@ ted radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) .
factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are to be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via bile .
for stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to an average daily dose of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , systemic exposure to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 29.@@ 3 % in the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ ph Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2,@@ 6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

advise is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( due to the lack of factor VI@@ II conditional , con@@ genital heart defect disorder ) .
dosage and frequency of application depends on whether Adv@@ ant@@ ages are used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but manufactured according to a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which enabled it to form the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II .
advise is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ ant@@ ages in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood samples has been awarded &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of Adv@@ ant@@ ages ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
do not apply in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the transfer of lawyers across the European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events the factor VI@@ II activity in the appropriate period should not fall below the given plasma level ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer , until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated .
inj@@ ections repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the danger for the patient is over .
during the course of treatment , a reasonable determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma level is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in response to factor VI@@ II , reach different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ life times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis For long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose , a test must be carried out to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the rate of injection should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always present against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ directed Ig@@ G immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma via modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , although the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ tide ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the most common A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , who all occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) The unexpected drop in the blood co@@ agulation factor VI@@ II @-@ mirror occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient with continuous A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - levels in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient levels on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2,4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE .
in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) were detected by prior exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend as well as a continued peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that were indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ lic gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the scope of the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE reported over hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co @-@ factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE were conducted in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( basic factor of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP further evaluated the benefit @-@ risk weighing as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP based on A@@ DV@@ A@@ TE &apos;s safety profile , which requires a P@@ SU@@ R@@ s filing every 6 months , decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ umes its application for the transfer of Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can not cause infections in humans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
adv@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to re @-@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene that is not broken in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered .
in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is broken , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of under@@ growth , bones and brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the assessment of the initially submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
the CH@@ MP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ours provides benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company did not prove sufficient that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful either for the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; release means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents aged 12 and over , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( blocked nose ) , are cl@@ ut@@ ched .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can cause the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy end@@ points were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all ha@@ y@@ fever symptoms besides con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received a@@ ero a@@ ze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another drug used for treating allergies ) .
it may also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , heart disease or vascular disease including hypertension ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ osis ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges ) , or have a risk of an hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to SP Europe for the transport of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to swallow in the whole ( i.e. without bit@@ ing , breaking or chew@@ ing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy , Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound .
it is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may reduce the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within the 2 weeks after termination of such therapy .
this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , Per@@ go@@ lid , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tive pills ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ acet@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ al@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient population , and the data does not suff@@ ice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data does not suff@@ ice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment must be dis@@ continued in case of hypertension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as headaches or a strengthening of headache ) .
patients with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck sob@@ bing , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is present at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether or not des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out .
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the in@@ convenience of using Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and because of the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in an impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machines .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental attention , cy@@ an@@ ose , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible le@@ thal sequences .
headaches , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , exc@@ itation , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ operative pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ illary rigi@@ dity and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es and the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on @-@ molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flow rates , including ampli@@ fication of subjective m@@ sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestation of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine during the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aero@@ bic tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined on the basis of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aero@@ bic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
in the framework of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma .
after the oral application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the floating balance of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
as part of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study , which was conducted with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were poorly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was bio@@ equivalent to the exposure of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
however , based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system described in Module 1 8.1 of the marketing application is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a of the swelling drug pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ osi@@ tive stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a closure of the stomach or the du@@ oden@@ um ( intestinal ob@@ struction ) , a bladder neck cap , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed with you in the application of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • high blood pressure • heart rate , pal@@ pit@@ ations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches , or strengthening of existing headaches .
when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
in case of use in the recommended dosage , it is not to be expected that Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze will lead to di@@ zz@@ iness or reduce the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
if you forgot to take a dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , if you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
heart ch@@ asing , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disorders , nerv@@ ousness , and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , upset stomach , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye @-@ catching liver enzymes was also very rare reported .
it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup , respectively .
for children between the ages of six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies involving asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rants , impairment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptoms scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decline of 12 to 26 % in patients who received placebo .
in both studies at Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decline in the symptoms scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union to the company SP Europe .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , for relief of symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease process and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resum@@ ed when re@@ occurring .
in case of the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , the patient can be recommended a continuous treatment during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not as@@ cer@@ tained in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not reinforced ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in an impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machines .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side @-@ effects reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo .
the most commonly encountered adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study of 5@@ 78 adolescents aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was headache , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study that administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es and the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesi@@ on @-@ molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a clinical study with multiple doses given in des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n administered up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flow rates , including ampli@@ fication of subjective m@@ sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and per@@ s@@ isti@@ ble allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria became representative for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , because the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology in spite of eti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited .
since the history of history is a caus@@ al factor in all caus@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also expected to improve symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant accumulation following once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .

Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in @-@ vi@@ vo not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , high @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the pre @-@ clinical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

eri@@ us can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experiencing higher substance levels ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed normally .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol , so patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group , similar to the placebo group .
clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti @-@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect described in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n administered up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed .
at an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not adver@@ sely affect psych@@ om@@ ot@@ ics .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation following once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In several single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup is available in type III Bra@@ ung@@ o bottles with child @-@ safe polypropylene connecting cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side @-@ effects reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , in which up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied .
A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G @-@ interval data .
there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect described in a clinical trial with multiple cans in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered for over 14 days in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .

there is limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and placebo group was equal and did not differ significantly from the safety profile found in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us has proved to be a bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate for the formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of flow rates , including ampli@@ fication of subjective m@@ sleep@@ iness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this badly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) larger than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( A@@ wak@@ ening 2 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single @-@ dose Cros@@ sover trials of A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ sensitivity studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us processed tablets support the use of the 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

in single @-@ dose crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg processed tablets with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ ate , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ations tests for the melt tablet showed that this formulation is an unlikely hazard to local irrit@@ ations in clinical applications .
the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children that are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ec@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not use this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in small children between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2.3 % ) .
in an additional study , a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n &apos;s solution was not observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years .
the recommended doses were comparable to the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials , at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of symptoms .
as shown from the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater with black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
since A@@ eri@@ us contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio @-@ equivalent study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets .
in various single dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company res@@ umes its application for permission to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus occurs , which can easily spread from human to human , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) on the other hand .
following the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign body &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to form antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) has been puri@@ fied and used as part of the vaccine .
a survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data basis for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in a clinical examination and need more information about your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over the age of four who are infected with the human immuno@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immuno@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination was not investigated .
generic A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked the anti@@ viral medication used by the patient and the likel@@ ihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily , which together with twice daily 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines are taken .
in children aged between 4 and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ eri@@ ase is based on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , a@@ eri@@ ase decreases the HIV @-@ amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
aids do not cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS .
a@@ eri@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the antibody increased with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the use of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger anti @-@ viral load after four weeks compared to those who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or :
the most common side effects of a@@ eri@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
a@@ eri@@ ase must also not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ eri@@ ase have the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of a@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children aged over four years are predomin@@ ant .
a@@ eri@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic rein@@ for@@ cer Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted approval to Gla@@ xo Group Limited by the European Commission for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
generic A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are usually to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram pro milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ ga@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of a@@ eri@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ ga@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic , efficacy and safety of a@@ eri@@ ase in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
a@@ eri@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate h@@ ep@@ atic dys@@ functions , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r during the seizure of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with a@@ eri@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
generic A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are usually used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal disease .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant medical information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
as the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an concur@@ rent administration of ast@@ er@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , am@@ per@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of the interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content of the a@@ eri@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
a@@ eri@@ ase should be removed in the duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases that were required to treat medicines which are associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. Higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it .
in hem@@ ophi@@ le patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous ha@@ em@@ at@@ oma and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is adopted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol intake , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time using medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resulting in vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the degra@@ ded plasma levels by means of a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , unwanted effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % , by contrast , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % degradation when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring because the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study used to use a@@ eri@@ ase in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ ch@@ ine component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenue of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and a@@ eri@@ ase are at least an hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ ch@@ da below ) .
for this reason , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , no dose adjustment is required .
treatment with am@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is required as del@@ a@@ viruses could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level .
caution is required if these medicines are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din .
the simultaneous injection of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ eri@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous use of 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ gland ) once daily without simultaneous use of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions in common with A@@ gener@@ ase .
therefore , patients should be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as a@@ eri@@ ase since it can come to resor@@ ption dys@@ functions .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ s@@ ants known as enzyme @-@ induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ pen@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine .
concur@@ rent intake with a@@ eri@@ ase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen the associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous dose of a@@ eri@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the possible benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected while taking A@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma level increases in these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this drug is not recommended with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabil@@ ising the mirrors is recommended , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with the same dose of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in combination with oral Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while with simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt am@@ pren@@ e@@ vir@@ - dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
in the case of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae along with a@@ eri@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while taking A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , however , it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is passed into breast milk in humans .
a reproductive study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother &apos;s animal .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most of the side effects associated with the a@@ eri@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to abor@@ tion .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are in connection with the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or another drug used at the same time , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ J@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medi@@ cation , and occurred in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and facial sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and thor@@ ny fat accumulation .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated subjects treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ din for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( sti@@ ern@@ isation ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the trial PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ Din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ules nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually appeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled .
cases of oste@@ on@@ oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
in PI treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed in patients who received a@@ eri@@ ase along with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient must be observed at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures can be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active center of the HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thus prevents the processing of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins with the result of an un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ conduc@@ tion ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the relationship between the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r stained treatment schem@@ as with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
sixteen out of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients who received 700@@ mg of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study occurred a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children , in which a viral failure occurred within the 59 included patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults .
L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , M@@ 36@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / L , I@@ 47@@ V , G@@ 48@@ V , I@@ 50@@ V , A@@ 7@@ 1@@ V , V@@ 77@@ I , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M .
in the AP@@ V@@ 3@@ 000@@ 3 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance on F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four genes with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on the cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients , in which a F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ e@@ virus failed ( one of them demonstrated a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , ind@@ in@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early break@@ age of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the receipt of the efficacy of a@@ eri@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ PH@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( Vir@@ us@@ last ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) , either A@@ gener@@ ase ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ dan@@ o@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low @-@ dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , in case of a non @-@ leak@@ age threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of untreated a@@ eri@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre@@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase was examined for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice a day , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
no low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s associated with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ roasted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ eri@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral dosing , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % , by contrast , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ affected by food intake , although simultaneous intake influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration by am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to be administered with care if they are given at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of a@@ eri@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , results in a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure , as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore , a@@ eri@@ ase solution and a@@ eri@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram @-@ basis .
the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those found in healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in male animals , who spoke to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence for the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings from the current exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test , micro@@ nucle@@ us test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ically or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase activity .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of a@@ eri@@ ase or after the end of treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bits ) or significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the intensi@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of a@@ eri@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ ga@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be performed with care in patients with weak or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .
a@@ eri@@ ase should be removed in the duration of 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resulting in vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % , by contrast , increased by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , it is recommended a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring because the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with am@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended , as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
caution is required if these medicines are used together ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although no clinical data is available for this .

in the case of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ae along with a@@ eri@@ ase , increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti @-@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in the AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproductive study on pregnant rats , which was administered by the implant@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient must be observed at signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary supporting measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % hem@@ or@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in ac@@ utely infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ roasted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ eri@@ ase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the overall concentration of drugs in the steady state via the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss up to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to be administered with care if they are given at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .

in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats in male animals ben@@ ign h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occurred in dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .

toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in young the metabol@@ isation paths are not yet fully mature , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .

the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram pro milli@@ gram are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , as soon as they are able to swallow the capsules , stop taking the solution for intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for a@@ eri@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of a@@ eri@@ ase solution for intake and low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be given , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ co@@ l content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
concur@@ rent administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of drug metabolism and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with a@@ eri@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the substance concentration are available .

concur@@ rent intake with a@@ eri@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are significantly increased following oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .

if you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . - This medicine was prescribed to you personally .
it can hurt other people even if they have the same complaints as you . - If any of the side effects you have significantly imp@@ acted or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of a@@ eri@@ ase .
the use of a@@ eri@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above conditions or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has advised that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure you have carefully read the instructions on rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting the treatment .
there is also no adequate information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for effect ampli@@ fication in children between 4 and 12 years or in general in patients less than 50 kg body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before starting taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control the prop@@ ens@@ ity of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge . − Wi@@ thin patients who receive anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat can occur .

the frequency and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks .
before bed@@ time , the cream is dil@@ uted to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains on the skin for a long time ( approximately eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area each for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies to a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 18 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a showed a complete recovery rate of up to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream can continue until all visible genital war@@ ts disappear in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the treated les@@ ions are cured only in@@ completely after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
once a dose has been om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then continue with the usual therapeutic schedule .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream can be applied in a thin layer and in the puri@@ fied , with ti@@ lt @-@ infected skin area , until the cream is fully absorbed .

in other studies where no daily intake was performed , two cases of heavy phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with a circumc@@ ision leading to circumc@@ ision were observed .
in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine in higher than the recommended doses there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation was observed under appropriate use , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
until now there are no clinical experiences available for use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream directly following treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied methods for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal area .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of inclin@@ ation reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients concerning the removal of the genital war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips or hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions generally dimin@@ ishes during therapy or the reactions form back after conclusion of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of the local skin reactions , a treatment period may be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the treatment of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the treatment is finished .
since no data is currently available for long @-@ term treatment rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ im@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experiences in patients with recur@@ rent and previously treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is less chance of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip@@ stick .
very limited data on the application of i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical positions outside the face and scal@@ p are available .
the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the under@@ arms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity in the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream .
if the local skin reactions cause a lot of discomfort or are very strong for the patient , treatment may be exposed for a few days .
data from an open clinical trial reveal that patients with more than 8 ac@@ - les@@ ions exhibited less complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .

the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
this evaluation of clinical signs fores@@ een by the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream there are often local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cl@@ ori@@ ation / bran@@ ching ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) .
according to the study plan , clinical evidence suggests that in these studies , five @-@ week treatment with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream often leads to severe Er@@ y@@ cles ( 31 % ) , severe erosion ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring and sti@@ cking ( 19 % ) .

in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the efficacy in regards to a complete healing of the genital war@@ ts during an i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is significantly superior .
60 % of patients treated with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ i@@ od@@ ine treated patients completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ ine treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were immuno@@ hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .

the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications of external ti@@ lt , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not normally occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the effectiveness of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable with that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fi@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application , conducted for four months , did not result in similar effects .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours to the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , a risk for man due to systemic exposure can be regarded as very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater number than in the control group with low U@@ VR .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on reducing the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion station .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of the lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .

the producer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. to transfer Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms to the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma should be done by a physician who possesses experience in treating patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing this , every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosage schedule could be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ma may develop fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ ation facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
as a result of the phase 3 clinical trial , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are expected to be present , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a prolonged period of inter@@ ruption , the theore@@ tically elevated risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be performed cau@@ ti@@ ously .
60 minutes before starting the in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ka ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ induced reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have fallen , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine because there is a potential risk of interfer@@ ence with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not result in direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma .
adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly reported as in@@ fusion @-@ related responses , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment time of up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms observed during the Phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .

up to the end of the phase 3 study ( or early withdrawal from the study ) 13 / 45 patients did not present det@@ ectable antibodies by radio@@ immuno@@ hist@@ ochem@@ istry ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the ration@@ ale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ata and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyme activity .
after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation system and cells entered into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms every week for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ma showed improvement in lung function and the capacity to be cured in the following table .
an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not statisti@@ cally significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increases further propor@@ tionally to the height of children .
from 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was determined , which remained constant until the end of the study .
regarding the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into consideration clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the severe current form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients , the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased G@@ ag@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in Har@@ n in week 22 .
in several patients a growth rate ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined according to the Z @-@ score for this age group The younger patients with the moderate follow @-@ up form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in older patients with severe delay , only limited or no progress in cognitive development was detected .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be a justi@@ fiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regi@@ mens is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to older and less affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug for cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( cancer ) or malign@@ ant ( cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as a therapy for patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and get inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ em@@ etic drug &quot; should be added ( remedy against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a fluid deficiency ) .
in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , removed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed also s@@ lows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients with cancer did not attack squ@@ am@@ ous cell proliferation in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta for longer survival times than with the comparative medicine .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. to transport A@@ lim@@ ta to the entire European Union .
each cup has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dos@@ ages is taken from the cup and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with lung or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given on the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) per week prior to the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after every third operation cycle .
in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood flow should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and plat@@ el@@ et count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment course a dose examination must take place taking into account the Na@@ di@@ rs of the blood @-@ image or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after recovery , patients must be further treated in accordance with the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Level 2 bleeding .
if patients with non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) develop ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA needs to be abor@@ ted if an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degrees 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 doses or 4 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in the presence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical trials showed no indication that patients with 65 years of age or more than 65 years of age have an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 45 ml / min which exceed the dose adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ times of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone @-@ bone and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils again have a value ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the needle of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the previous cycles of treatment ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was treated after a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients need to be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measures to reduce the treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( C@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ va cy@@ l@@ lic acid ( &gt; 1,3 g a day ) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the incidence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the ergometer before the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ lat@@ inal space .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , if this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( excluding yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible degradation of the reproductive @-@ ability by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment regi@@ ment to get advice regarding the sperm con@@ serving .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re de@@ position with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
caution is therefore advisable to apply high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the treatment , be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data is present with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with a long half @-@ life like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ agulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy necess@@ it@@ ates increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren An@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnant women .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be used during pregnancy except when necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of fo@@ etus ( see Section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive @-@ ability by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment to collect advice regarding the sperm conversion .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mig@@ rates into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects of the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who received random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
side effects Frequ@@ encies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on available data of spontaneous reports ) .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported in &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treated su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mia .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity degree 3 and 4 was similar to the Phase 2 mixed mono@@ therapies ( n = 16@@ 4 ) of phase 2 , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in Alan@@ ine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in the patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal bas@@ eline levels of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events that could be possible in connection with the study medi@@ cation ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who received random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ized to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was set for inclusion of all events in which the report doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for possible .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( often ) of patients who received random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed include :
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received ran@@ - dom@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treated :
serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in hospital studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
in clinical trials , patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal intestinal penetration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
from clinical trials in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment occasionally cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure were reported .
it was reported about cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see Section 4.4 ) .
cases of radi@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ sep@@ tic , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ li@@ cles @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple attack points by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ in- and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , single @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ a@@ ï@@ ve patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically meaningful survival compared to those treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine during the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and worsen@@ ing lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was medi@@ an survival of patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plat@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.@@ 0@@ 47 ) in patients with squ@@ am@@ ous cell carcin@@ oma ( n = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ised controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre @-@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
PFS was 4,@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27@@ ,@@ 3 - 3@@ 3.@@ 9 ) for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 31.@@ 4 ) for the combination gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below .

dissolve the content of 500 mg / ml bottles with sodium chlori@@ de ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , which results in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed .
the resulting solution is clear and the colour@@ ation ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish @-@ yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who are allergic to All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise certain fats in food , thus giving approximately a quarter of the fats supplied with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared with a BM@@ I of 25 to 28 kg / m2 with placebo in 3@@ 91 overweight patients .
in both studies involving a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss was observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches of anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bow@@ el movement , bow@@ el movement , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , bow@@ l@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs .
it must not be applied in patients who are treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or in ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and in pregnant women or nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to Gla@@ xo Group Limited by the European Commission for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ised , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous Treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic Mal@@ absorption syndrome • St@@ up@@ time ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction may be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting treatment with all@@ i , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tics needs to be adjusted .
patients who use all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of this drug has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional anti @-@ pregnancy measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma levels was observed in a study on drug interactions and in several cases using or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
for the use of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally standardized ratio , IN@@ R ) might be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be recommended to take an additional mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Section 4.4 ) .
after the gift of a one @-@ time dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease in am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and coinci@@ de with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of captured fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
the frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of potential and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
most of the cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the market have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at properties can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect relies on the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ str@@ ischen and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ s .
clinical trials have shown that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at is taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat is blocked .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , o@@ ily @-@ induced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight versus the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the study course ( Table 1 ) and as percentage of those participants who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline 3,@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at the waist circum@@ ference , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value of 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma could only be spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any signs of accumulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ Form@@ yl Leu@@ cine group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients , which represented approximately 42 % of total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .

even if these diseases do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should still ask your doctor for a check @-@ up examination .
you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram for 2 kg of body weight , which you lose during a diet .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not a prescription medicine .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ tations , severe rheumatoid arthritis and certain severe skin diseases . • War@@ far@@ in or other medicines that have a blood dil@@ uting effect .
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of oral contrac@@ eption to contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or removed when you have strong diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one to treat heart rhythm disorders .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and • if you take drugs against high blood pressure , as you may need to adjust the dosage . • If you have too high cholesterol levels , you may need to adjust the dosage .
for more helpful information on the blue pages in Section 6 , see how to determine your cal@@ ori@@ ze and fet@@ al boundaries .
if you om@@ it a meal or eat no fat , do not take a capsule . all@@ i can only work when the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in connection with a meal containing too much fat , you risk diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see Section 4 ) .
to get used to your body with the new eating habits , start before the first capsule intake with a cal@@ orie and fat @-@ reduced diet .
nutritional di@@ aries are effective as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably make you more likely to change your eating habits .
to ensure your target weight , you should set two daily targets in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• You eat fatty foods to reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . try to move more before you start taking the capsules .
remember to ask your doctor in advance if you are not used to physical activity . • Sta@@ y physically active while taking and also after stopping the intake of all@@ i .
• all@@ i may not be taken for more than 6 months . • If after twelve weeks of application of all@@ i no reduction of your weight can be detected , ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may have to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not about changing the diet at short notice and then returning to the old habits .
• If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule after . • If more than an hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence with and without o@@ ily outlet ( sudden or aug@@ mented chair tension and soft fa@@ eces ) can be traced back to the mechanism of action ( see Section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe short@@ ness of breath , swe@@ ats , rash , it@@ ching , swelling of the face , pal@@ pit@@ ations , circul@@ atory collapse .
29 Very common side effects These can occur in more than 1 out of 10 people taking all@@ i . • flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without o@@ ily outlet • Soft or o@@ ily chair • Soft chair inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects ampli@@ fies or significantly impaired you .
frequent side effects These can occur at 1 out of 10 people who are taking all@@ i . • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( Chair ) • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( chair ) • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( chair ) • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( chair ) • aqu@@ eous / liquid chair • increased bow@@ el pressure • Know@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects ampli@@ fies or significantly impaired you .
effects on blood tests It is not known how often these effects occur . • In@@ cre@@ ase of certain liver enzyme levels • Eff@@ ects on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients who use war@@ far@@ in or other blood @-@ th@@ inning drugs ( anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulating ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and result in increasing fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment , as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize the diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms : • Begin already a few days or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you are going to exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a holding table , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store medicines for children . • Do not apply any longer after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the box . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
don &apos;t swallow it . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) , which is enclosed in this pack .

obesity has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • hypertension • Diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and has a positive effect on your health .
select meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you also find in food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume a maximum of calories per day .
note the tables below in this section . • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
please refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Because of the capsule &apos;s mode of action , compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended intake of fat , you can maximize your weight and at the same time reduce the likel@@ ihood of diet @-@ related accompanying symptoms .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you daily burn only little or even do not go up stairs , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal each day , e.g. through 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For a lasting weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to keep them . • Me@@ aning is a nutritional diary with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information can help you to develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ is can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti @-@ em@@ etic ) .
the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended , as there are not enough information about the effects of this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , which prevents recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chemotherapy , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 from 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsin@@ n Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ is is indicated : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
as pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on as@@ say , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ ble ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous dispens@@ ing of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension .
in addition to a further chem@@ o@@ therapeutic administration , Alo@@ is is expected to be used neither for prevention nor treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents studied ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ operi@@ dol , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience in the application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , therefore pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which might at least be related to al@@ op@@ ia , headaches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage , similar occur@@ ren@@ ces of un@@ desirable events , such as in the other dosage groups , were not observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective in treating an alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron receiving intraven@@ ously at day 1 .
results of studies with moderate em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G @-@ effects of an IV pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
resor@@ ption After IV injection follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale sem@@ ici@@ r@@ cle of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area below the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire dose range of 0,@@ 3@@ 90 μ of g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ately .
after intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration in 11 tes@@ tic@@ ular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , the value measured after one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg was comparable ; however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after the one @-@ time dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor compared to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies of metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an IV single dose of 10 micro@@ grams per kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered active substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bolt injection .
while in patients with severe liver dysfunction , termin@@ ale elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can pro@@ long the duration of action .
high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) which were given daily over two years resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and as alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans .
the holder of this authorisation for placing on the market must inform the European Commission on the plans for the marketing of the drug approved within the framework of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative opinion , in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has damage , moreover , the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood @-@ norm .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which stimulates it to form the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that show the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 out of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after receiving treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non business purposes only provided provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged
in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ ane , the disease increased again in more patients than with the reference medic@@ aments ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug constitutes an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected la@@ ths ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ Tamiflu @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because it may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but for patients less than 18 years , the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients among placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in case of skin wounds , approximately 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( stained cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused or probably caused by MR@@ SA , it is not effective enough .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the surface .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh the risks associated with short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. for the transport of alt@@ ar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or severe local irritation due to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment the treatment is canc@@ eled , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be begun .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections with which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected area occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected to be expected in vi@@ vo ( see Section 5.2 ) due to the low plasma concentrations observed in humans after topical application on sk@@ inn@@ ed skin or infected superficial wounds .
3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ines AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment rose by 81 % after topical application of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity according to oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fo@@ etus / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be used during pregnancy when topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotics .
deciding whether breast feeding should be continued / stopped or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / stopped is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman .
in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that have used al@@ tar@@ go , the most common reported side effect was irritation at the administration of the administration which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from C@@ lit@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is due to the selective in@@ hibition of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding on this binding site , p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits the pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , partly block P @-@ binding inter@@ actions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s @-@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
should the local pre@@ valence of resistance apply to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some types of infection , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin opposite S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ contact to the treatment at S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = p@@ ant@@ on @-@ val@@ ent@@ ine leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily by occ@@ lu@@ sion to intact and sc@@ rap@@ ed skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of infected trau@@ matic wounds , single plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medication and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion on humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ unk of skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ ol IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP inhibit@@ or .
metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver microphones was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro @-@ review on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rat micro@@ nucle@@ us for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were no signs of limited fertility in male nor female rats at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ unk ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years old who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be carried out .
if a re@@ fres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines work by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teach &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the immune system ( the natural defence of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the since 1996 approved vaccine Twin@@ matrix adults and the since 1997 approved vaccine Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ CA@@ rix children are given a vacc@@ ination plan existing from three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ matrix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ head adults are also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for a month after the last injection .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B , between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar in a six month and a 12 month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue , and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals a permit to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standardi@@ zation schedule for pri@@ mers with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , with the first dose being given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a chim@@ ney shr@@ ink@@ age is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immuno@@ competent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vacc@@ ination require a re@@ fres@@ co@@ ction as protection , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As for all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and those with disorders of the immune system , there may be no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody , so that additional doses of vacc@@ ines can be required in these cases .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal in@@ suffici@@ ency in the glut@@ eal muscles , these injection paths should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ally as an exception , as in these cases , bleeding can occur after intra@@ muscular administration .
when ambient psych@@ rix in the second year of life was given in the form of a separate injection , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined mass @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is assumed that there may be no adequate immune response .
in a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ernity , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier thi@@ om@@ al and preserv@@ ative form@@ ulations .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines have been administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , Ambi@@ rix &apos;s tolerance was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and consistency on a calculation basis per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had been given the ambi@@ x reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ in@@ iness was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who received Ambi@@ rix ) compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in subjects who received the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ in@@ iness was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the atmosphere group was similar to that observed when administered with the 3 @-@ t@@ ins combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ old age , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with the combination @-@ vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 @-@ administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , month 6 @-@ administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted in 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combin@@ ant vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ rates ( SP in table below ) were significantly higher compared to Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination @-@ vaccine with 360 ELISA @-@ units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immun@@ ore@@ action against both anti@@ gens in this study was comparable to those found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine comprising of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be shown 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given at the same time as a combination of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular Per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined mass @-@ m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study , which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults , showed similar serum and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates similar to previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ p@@ ation of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted via viral food and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as swimming in waters contaminated by waste water .
you may feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that might make a stationary treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus even if the complete vacc@@ ination series with 2 doses has been completed .
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B @-@ Virus ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction can result in it@@ chy r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If your child has an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you want rapid protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose ) .
at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child of vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will be inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots . • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body &apos;s defense , or if you / your child undergo a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be adequate so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Sa@@ y to your doctor if you / your child occupy other medicines ( including those you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / or has been given / or has been planned in the near future .
it may be , however , that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person therefore is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient .
usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women will not be given , unless it is urgently needed that they can be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ only very often ( more than 1 case per 10 but@@ ton@@ ed cans ) : • pain or discomfort at the site or redness • Ir@@ rit@@ ability • headache • Appeti@@ zing loss
♦ frequent ( up to 1 case per 10 but@@ ton@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Di@@ et @-@ di@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal discomfort
other side effects that have been reported for days or weeks following vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 fall per 10,000 bl@@ ended doses ) are reported :

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have been known since the initial approval of the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , as Ambi@@ rix was placed in traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients at the age of more than a month with in@@ trin@@ sic enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ium is - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nose tube ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study since Am@@ mon@@ aps could not be compared to another treatment or placebo ( a placebo ) .
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also cause loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste sa@@ di@@ version , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle have effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , limited information about this medicine occurred . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a delayed form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , there is an indication for use when there is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ulate form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and the development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine scar@@ ring , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine ar@@ gin@@ ine syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure , as well as in combination with sodium retention and ede@@ ma .
since metabol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate is done over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the significance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation was slow@@ ed down and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functional nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in the breast milk in humans , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ am@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose case occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10@@ g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ lically active compound which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is similar to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients suffering from disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ine .
it is important that the diagnosis is diagnosed early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious , and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
due to hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen discharge ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born at post@@ part@@ um ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a delayed form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ ic form of the or@@ ni@@ thine @-@ scar@@ pa@@ thy @-@ defect ) , which recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine . phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated end@@ ings of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) was no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after ni@@ ghtly fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher in the plasma level than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
after the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate had no compla@@ ined effects in toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either or@@ ally taken ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or have given a gastro@@ po@@ stom@@ y or a nose tube .
the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
for patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thine scar@@ ring , the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions were found in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tic aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ am@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is similar to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ro@@ genous atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed , that sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further worsen@@ ing of neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate in gran@@ ular form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate were determined 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the period of durability , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
this procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate .
if a patient has to obtain the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS may also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate after consuming proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ ate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and damage your baby .
in rare cases confusion , headaches , taste disturbances , post@@ uring of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and a worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms , feel free to contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating an appropriate treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on equal single doses or via a stomach fi@@ st@@ ula ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nose tube ( tube , which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the tank . • Fil@@ l a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring sco@@ op is equivalent to a measuring spoon .
Angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( abnormal measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if Angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is given and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of AC@@ S in which the effect of angi@@ ox@@ in was compared with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug to prevent blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI .
during the PCI , the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube that remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ritu@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of AC@@ S , Angi@@ ox - with or without the administration of G@@ PI - was as effective in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients undergoing a PCI , Angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
Angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ ali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Angi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd for the transfer of angi@@ o@@ grams in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in an emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.1 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a patient is PCI in another row , an additional cap@@ ita of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours after the clinical necessity .
prior to the procedure , a bol@@ us can be administered of 0.5 mg / kg , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dose of angi@@ o@@ xim@@ e in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent IV in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery .
the safety and efficacy of an all@@ uring Bol@@ us @-@ Gift of Angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI @-@ intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to below 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed prior to application and the bolt dose should be quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ ali@@ ru@@ din versus AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 second , a second cap@@ tive dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt has to be checked again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes following the administration of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ bolt without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and patients with di@@ aly@@ sis , Angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox@@ in may be initiated 30 minutes after termination of intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• unknown hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • serious kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients must be carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when it is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
although most of the ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges on arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points occur in PCI patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous bas@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) may occur during the treatment in principle throughout hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and being treated with bi@@ d@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after dropping treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is once again reaching the level existing prior to treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological check@@ matic parameters are regularly monitored .
the animal experiments are inadequate with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth , or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ fac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , there were more un@@ desirable events in women and patients over the age of 65 compared to male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ ed@@ ings have been defined in accordance with AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ ed@@ ings such as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the punc@@ tured area , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed hem@@ or@@ r@@ cal@@ isations occurred , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; point positions , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects are based on the data from a clinical trial of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients who are PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , there were more un@@ desirable events in women and patients over the age of 65 compared to male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly lower than in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in Table 6 .
in case of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ valve should be stopped immediately and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox@@ in contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as in the an@@ ion @-@ detection region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible because th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in on its part slowly cle@@ aves the binding of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum from patients in the past had come to he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in induced thro@@ mb@@ al syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and patients , bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ based and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was followed by a PCI , an additional cap@@ ita of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ ali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion was increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or by PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or elevated cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent surgery within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information about the use of angi@@ o@@ xim@@ e in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients who underwent a perc@@ ut@@ aneous bas@@ on@@ ar@@ intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with AC@@ S .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin cell@@ is@@ ine differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in type 2 diabetes , where insulin is unable to work effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes in adults , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin c@@ law .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to is@@ lan@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to acquire A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or del@@ to@@ id or by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal wall .
due to reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of force , brand ( herd ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ arded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements .
3 An insufficient dosage or termination of treatment , particularly in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening .
the change of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be subject to strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar reduction and increase the tendency towards hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzymes ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disc@@ op@@ y@@ ons , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympath@@ ic poly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ ine and reser@@ pine .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin cell@@ is@@ ine enters human breast milk , but generally insulin does not enter breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application .
listed below are the unwanted pharmac@@ ies known from clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very frequent : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration problems , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive hun@@ - ger , changes in vision , headaches , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ c@@ tal injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( especially due to skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) and by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the duration of the active insulin is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study with 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin therapy in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose proportional to the dose proportional to glu@@ cos@@ es@@ enk@@ ende effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ es@@ enk@@ ende effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data , a similar post @-@ pran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached in an application of is@@ lan@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , as given with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if is@@ lan@@ is@@ ine was cooked 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ lu@@ sive control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if is@@ lan@@ is@@ in is turned 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control like in human normal insulin , which is given 2 Mi@@ - nu@@ ten before the meal ( see Fig@@ ure 1 ) , is achieved .
insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal was given before the beginning of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ B ) .
is@@ lan@@ is@@ ine at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Fig@@ ure 1@@ C ) .
