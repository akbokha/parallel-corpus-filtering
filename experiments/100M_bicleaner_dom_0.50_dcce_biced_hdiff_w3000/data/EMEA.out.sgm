<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR), explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) judged the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package supplement (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. whirling thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternate with periods of normal tuning.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used to quickly control increased unrest or behavioural disorders if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for intake or the melt tablets in patients who difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, who are just as abilify as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of neurons to one another." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Aripiprazole probably works primarily as a" "" "partial agonist" "" "for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters, acts to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalise the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies over up to a year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, with which of Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the processed tablets and the solution to take in (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In the two trials with the injection solution patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed significantly greater ease in the symptoms of increased anxiety than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">During the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively in four of the five short-time studies than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify effectively prevented the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients up to 74 weeks and in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo for the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrollable itch), nausea, somnolence (drowsiness), nausea, drowsiness (increased salivary), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the Benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes corresponded to treatment with Aripiprazole were outweighed against the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution were outweighed by increased anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder if oral therapy is not suitable.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for placing Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a daily maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day, regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4-inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The appearance of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after beginning or after changing an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole in comparison with other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoteric and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, you should consider reducing the dose or cancelling the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that suggest a MNS or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years old with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there were in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients who were treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no accurate risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipoles, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combined bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary efficacy of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with superimposed side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripipezol by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisians, the joint application with high-acting inhibitors of CYP3A4 results in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison with CYP2D6 extensive metabolisiers.</seg>
<seg id="53">If one considers the common application of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered together with a moderate increase in Aripipezol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazole per day did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (dextroopmethmorphine / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazole) and 3A4 (dextrometamorphism).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy due to the lack of data for safety in humans and because of the concerns raised in reproductive studies at the animal, unless the potential benefits clearly justifies the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study over 52 weeks occurred in patients who were treated with Aripiprazole, a total reduced incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Acathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripipezol treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripipezol and 15.1% in patients with Olantine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - in a controlled study of over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS amounted to 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripipezol treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">During the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripiprazol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipezol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or intentional acute overdosing with Aripiprazole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is useful in the treatment of overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma retention.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder leads to dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic action on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine H1receptors.</seg>
<seg id="76">The positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction of binding of 11C racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caucus and on the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of respondents who were attending the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripipezol 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed significantly greater improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher reduction in the incidence of recurrence, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, among significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder Aripiprazole showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole demonstrated a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania like lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I disorder, with or without psychotic features that partly did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension period over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkyation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole for extensive metabolisies via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'bad' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">At Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, as well as a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics gave no indication of clinically significant differences regarding the ethnicity or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripibozl, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the potential for carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so that they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent low-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times of the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy- Aripirazol at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study over 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages which led to expositions of the 3 and 11-fold Midwest-State AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, treatment with Aripipezol injection solution should be terminated and commence with oral application of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">To increase the absorption and minimize the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumvention of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the drugs used for maintenance or acutely therapy (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify processed tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the effectiveness of Aripipezol injection solution in patients with aggregation and behavioural disorders, which were different than caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripipezol injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure decrease (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripipezol injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, cardiac insufficiency, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acoteric and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, varying levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipoles, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to combined bidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazole, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15mg dosage) was used as a single-use intramuscularly, and the simultaneously Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) received intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, although this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= 'poor') Metabolisians, the joint application with high-acting inhibitors of CYP2D6 may result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripipezol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of Abilify should be raised to the dose level prior to the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg doses) were intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution more frequently (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials with oral Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">During the long-term study of 26 weeks during a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients with Aripipezol treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not result in medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphhokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripipezol compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects that may occur in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazole include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesired cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Aripiprazole injection solution associated with statistically significantly greater improvements of aggregation / behavioural disorders compared with placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 hours) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazole Injection Solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms of apathy and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- Reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score at the primary 2-hour endpoint was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar efficacy was observed regarding the overall population, but a statistical significance could be found due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of respondents who attended the study medication were similar in both groups (Aripipezol 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measured scales, which were defined as secondary study objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate scale, showed significantly greater improvement than at haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia a significantly higher reduction in the incidence of recurrence, which was 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin controlled, multinational double blind study involving schizophrenia over 26 weeks that included 314 patients and in which the primary study target 'weight gain' was, in significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which partially over 2 weeks did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum mirrors, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in a superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study in manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazole AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC after the dose of the same dose as tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 trials with healthy volunteers, the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripipezol injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated administration of systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- or 5 times over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application, there were no safety concerns about maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the potential for carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">Effects included a dose-dependent low-kidney toxicity (lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans.</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was established as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the Galle of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the mean steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11-fold of the central steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a main study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had been associated with anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only those who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">Patients who had previously received other treatments from their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">Patients may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in their blood prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients with the first treatment, more effective than conventional paclitaxel, and that in contrast to other medicines contained in paclitaxel, it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted approval to the company Abraxis BioScience Limited for the marketing of Abraxane in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first-line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anthracycline-containing therapy (see paragraph 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensorineal neuropathy degrees 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached on grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel which could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulation of paclitaxel (see Section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient may not be treated with paclitaxel once again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no new treatment courses should be initiated until neutrophils have increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the number of thrombocytes is increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly linked cardiotoxicity has not been proven, cardiac abnormalities in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">In case of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in patients after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual anti-emetic and constipating agents.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or women in childbearing age, who do not have effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women of childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane will be advised to not produce a child for up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm conserving prior to treatment, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infallibility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very frequent) and dizziness (frequent), which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and significant incidents of side effects reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer, which were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was rapidly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the administration of Abraxane as monotherapy in each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagy, flatulence, tongue burning, dry mouth, aching gum, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of the muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, joint pain, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive related case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence are possible and no causal relationship with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimkrotubules that promotes the containment of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular meshwork, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is believed that this improved transendendothelial transport is conveyed by the gp-60 albumin receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor because of the albuminous protein SPARC (secretted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm unaffiliated studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who received a paclitaxel chemotherapy every three weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 without premedication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously not received chemotherapy; 27% only had adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only because of metastasis and 19% for metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy degrees 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for the decay of baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 were determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The drug exposure exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After intravenous administration of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase way.</seg>
<seg id="318">The average distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates a far-reaching extravascularity distribution and / or soft tissue binding of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane were compared with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane administration (43%) than with solvent-based paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, it is reported that paclitaxel is primarily metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the mean value for cumulative urine secretion was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>

<seg id="359">This means that seamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicines").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood-iron values, in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood donor is not possible before the procedure and in which a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be taken under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in treating patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation, seamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided that they have received appropriate guidance.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic kidney failure or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency and iron supplements should be administered during the whole treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietine deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enabled it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">In the case of an injection into a vein, Abseamed was compared with the reference resin device in a main study with 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to seamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin-sprayed abseamed treated with those of Eprex / Erypo were examined in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia due to kidney problems, patients with hemoglobin were maintained in the same degree as those receiving Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients receiving Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the baseline value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which occasionally leads to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) reached the conclusion that for Abseamed according to the European Union regulations the evidence has shown that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces seamed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice Drugs Pütter GmbH & Co KG for the marketing of Abseamed in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumors, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and in which the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (such as cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia during chemotherapy onset).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, in planned larger surgical interventions involving a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood among women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of foreign blood, Abseamed may be used before a large electro-orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, in which high risk of transfusion complications is expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may be applied, which cannot participate in a autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, in which the hemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and as a consequence may vary depending on age, sex and total disease burden; therefore, an assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by over 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can be observed in one patient over or below the hemoglobin concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this haemoglobin variability an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the sustained haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose is 25% reduced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control anaemia and anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and - follow-up may vary depending on age, sex and total disease burden; this is why an assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of disease is required by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this haemoglobin variability an appropriate dose management should be used to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used in the lowest approved dose required to control the initial symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of haemoglobin value by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulosis increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl opposite the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the number of reticulosis increased to &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg of the hemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulosis number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">In contrast, the hemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulosis increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (haematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, abseamed should be received twice a week for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should begin as early as possible, e.g. a few weeks before the autologous blood donation programme begins, so that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa, which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each in 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from treatment with any erythropoietin at an erythroblastomenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive seamed or other erythropoietin (see Section 4.4 - erythroblastomenia).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboses (e.g. anamnestic venous thromboembolia).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a greater elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in a autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying diseases: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently established cardiac infarction or cerebrovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rarely was reported about the appearance of an antigen-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of efficacy, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased demand for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes should be investigated for non-contact (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium toxication, infections or inflammation, blood loss and hemolysis).</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value is reduced (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the platelet cyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other reason of a loss of action is found, the anti-erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration recommended under paragraph 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a hemoglobin concentration of over 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefit to the administration of epoetins if the haemoglobin concentration is increased via the concentration required for controlling the anaemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The hemoglobin increase should be approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic kidney failure and clinically-evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart disease, the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration recommended under paragraph 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the findings, the treatment of anaemia associated with epoetin alfa in adults with kidney failure, which is not yet dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In patients with chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should consider a 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoietin responses (patients who may need to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the hb increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of Patients with chemotherapy-related anaemia).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient, which should also take account of the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for a greater elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to the onset of epoetin alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo a greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events can exist for patients with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetine was not demonstrated to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, if a hemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5-8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporindose can be adjusted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro investigations on tumor tissues, there is no indication of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarcts, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, pulmonary thromboses, erythromboses and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoietin treatment, surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can result in thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>
<seg id="434">The genetically generated epoetin alfa is glycosilicated and in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydrate content is identical to the endogenous human erythropoietin, which was isolated from the urine of infected patients.</seg>
<seg id="435">It could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa specifically stimulates erythropoesis and does not influence leukopoesis.</seg>

<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis), the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Aclasta occur within the first three days after infusion and are less common in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to citric acid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion and osteonecrosis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Aclasta provides information material for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis, as well as a similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the Novartis Europharm Limited Company to obtain authorisation for the transport of Aclasta across the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic osteoporosis fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The Patient Information Package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • Contra-indications in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing help</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic osteoporosis fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with low-traumatic osteoarthritis, the administration of the infusion of Aclasta is recommended for two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the disease Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic osteoarthritis, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.E. oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinine-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as a limited clinical experience exists for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adjustment is not necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and teenagers Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, as data for safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokalenia therapy must be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before starting treatment with Aclasta (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid setting of the effect of citric acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalenia may develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene, should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dental treatment.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental encroachments, no data is available, if the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaws area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for each patient's treatment plan and are based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The frequency of cases of atrial fibrillation in patients who received Aclasta increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">The overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable in the osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial).</seg>
<seg id="609">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledron acid was associated with kidney function disorders, which manifested as a decrease in the kidney function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinine) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinine Clearance (measured every year prior to administration) and the incidence of kidney failure and a limited kidney function were in a clinical trial for osteoporosis over three years comparable between the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinine within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values, which were below the normal oscillation range (less than 2.6 mmol / l), reached 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the patients treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a recently developed hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before the administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of cooledron acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain, reported (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaws area has been broadly reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including citric acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaws area with an aclasta and a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In case of overdose, which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalzemia, a dose of oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate can be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for three consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density value (BMD) T-score for the Schenkelneck as ≤ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric curves Aclasta reduced significantly over a period of three years and already after a year the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% lower risk for spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta demonstrated a consistent effect over three years, resulting in a reduction of 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density on the lumbar spine, hips and distal radius compared with the placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase of lumbar spine increased by 6.7%, the entire hip by 6,0%, the lower spine by 5.1% and the distal radius of 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), a year after the third yearly dose bone biopsies were taken from the pelvic sludge.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propeptid of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Teleptid (b-CTx) in serum was determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">Treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Aclasta reduced BSAP after 12 months significantly by 30% compared to the baseline value and was held at 28% below the initial value to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D mirrors were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received a starting dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.E. oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Aclasta treatment compared to placebo treatment increased BMD at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to the placebo treatment at 5.4% in total waste and 4,3% on the neck neck.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was judged after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of Aclasta was not inferior compared to the once weekly administration of alendronate to the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in the Morbus Paget of the bone Aclasta was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 with radiologically confirmed, especially light to moderately heavy disease Paget of the bone (mean serum level of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6x to 3,0x age-specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledron acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedron once a day for 2 months has been proven in two six months comparison studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain and pain control was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Aclasta and Risedron.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study were included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with aclasta and 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with aclasta was maintained at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of Zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be a dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long period of very low concentration, not more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ a 0,24 and t ½ h 1,87 hours, followed by a long elioration phase with a terminal elimination period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the t ½ -values above) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-Clearance amounts to 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h irrespective of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion-time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease in Zoledron acid concentration at 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentrations against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished Clearance of metabolized substances metabolized by cytochromium-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoleironeic acid is not metabolized in humans and because they are a weak or even no direct and / or irreversible, metabolism-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Coleic Acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine Clearance, and was in the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function disorder right down to a creatine-inin Clearance to 35 ml / min does not require dose adjustment of the zoleironc acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Because for severe renal dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) only limited data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal intravenous single dose in mice was 10 mg / kg of body weight and in rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies in dogs, single doses of 1,0 mg / kg (based on the AUC the 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Sub-chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerance of Zoleironc acid in rats was determined by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC), well tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to accumulated expositions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects on other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injection site were observed.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent findings in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spongiosa in the metaphysis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all doses, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive action of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats observed teratogenicity in doses from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of low serum-calcium levels.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the drug is not immediately used, the user is responsible for storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron acid is a group of substances called bisphosphonate and is used for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, mainly estrogens formed by androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass that is observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">In the case of Paget's disease, bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone structure weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta does work by normalizing the bone structure again, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation, giving strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / apply, even if they are not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="677">For your doctor it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drinks, you are concerned that you have sufficient fluids in accordance with your doctor's instructions before and after the treatment with Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg administered to you by your doctor or nursing staff as infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Aclasta does work for a long time, you may need a further dose only after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">At Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work for more than a year and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If you missed the administration of Aclasta, contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before terminating the treatment with Aclasta If you are considering completing the treatment with Aclasta, please take your next physician's appointment and discuss it with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion occur very often (in more than 30% of patients), but are less common after the subsequent infusions.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headaches, occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently it is unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="696">Patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic osteoarthritis are advised to undertake the infusion of Aclasta 2 or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="697">Before and after the administration of Aclasta patients must be adequately supplied with liquid; this is particularly important for patients receiving diuretic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="698">Because of the rapid setting of the effect of citric acid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic, hypokalzemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days following the infusion of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="699">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide sufficient calcium intake in patients with Morbus Paget, according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Health Report (EPAR), explaining how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) evaluated the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (particularly obese patients) where metformin (a diabetes medication) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (particularly obese patients) who cannot be employed satisfactorily with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl resins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the Actos treatment, except in patients with hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar); this should reduce the dose of sulfonyl resins or insulin.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, so that type 2 diabetes can be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonyl resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to lowering the HbA1c value, suggesting that blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg doses.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy trial, the effect of an additional administration of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonyl resin had a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c values while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, patients who took Actos in addition to insulin had a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared with 0.14% in patients who took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events associated with Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypotheses (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, still in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin, in which metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted approval for Actos in the entire European Union to the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the mark" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and in which metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years, so the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients whose presence at least one risk factor (e.g. earlier heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease) is at risk of developing a compensating heart failure, the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be noted for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac safety.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients less than 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study there was an increase in reports of heart failure, which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, overstomach upset, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark harn, liver enzyme levels must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pioglitazone should be conducted until the laboratory parameters have been evaluated by clinical evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been demonstrated, which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a minor reduction in mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrit (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3,6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients with sulfonylurea and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrit by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two-fold or triple-combination therapy with insulin, the risk of dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After market introduction, treatment with Thiazolidindionen, including Pioglitazone, reported a decrease in visual acuity in diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between taking picoglitazone and macular edema, but prescribed physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema if patients report about disturbances of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events on bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind, clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be discontinued (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies to investigate the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines which are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in lowering the AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, in the treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsulin resistance produced in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the maternal animal decreased, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequent &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000; isolated cases: unknown (from this data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the lens and the index of refraction of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, ALT-Anstiege were often referred to as placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylurea.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe cardiac insufficiency was 1.6% higher than placebo, when Pioglitazone bzw respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it was rarely reported about cardiac insufficiency under pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with cardiac insufficiency in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients were conducted in the groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study over a period of 3.5 years, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ), which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclagingicide as monotherapy was continued over two years to examine the time until the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the beginning of the therapy a blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient in spite of three months of optimisation with insulin was randomized to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with Pioglitazone the mean HbA1c reduced by 0.45% compared to those receiving insulin. a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients was statistically significant compared to basal values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was studied in a small, 18 week examination of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical trials, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and a minor, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL cholesterol was observed in most clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced total plasma-glycerides and free fatty acids compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclincide and increased HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison with placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while under metformin and Gliclincide reduced levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone reduced not only the triglycerides, but also improved postlucent elevated triglyceride levels, this has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macular vascular disease were randomized in groups that received either Pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">According to oral application, pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, with top concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma, usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV to effectiveness in approximately three times the efficacy of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">Interaction studies have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">Simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the wood (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma-exclusion period of unmodified pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral Clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys agreed after repeated administering plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible eccentric hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that in treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia resulting in gestation and increased insulin resistance of the maternal animal decreased, thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic substrates for the fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) elevated indences of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male and female rats) and tumours (in male rats) of the urinary epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP) the treatment with two other Thiazolidindians led to an increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>
<seg id="822">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "30" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study over two years the effects of combination therapy of metformin were studied with either Pioglitazone or Gliclincide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease in albumin / creatinine quotients was statistically significant compared to basal values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study over 20 weeks, pioglitazone reduced not only the niblight triglycerides, but also improved the postlucent elevated triglyceride levels, this both via an effect on tryglycerid absorption as well as the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study had missed the goal of its primary endpoint, which represented a combination of the total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary artery disease, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary vascularization and vascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-term risks are associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="829">The tablets are white to whitish, round, flat and carry on one side the mark "45" and on the other side the inscription "Actos."</seg>
<seg id="830">In a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to bone fractures from randomised controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients who received treatment with Pioglitazon and of more than 7,400 patients receiving comparative mediation, there was an increased incidence of fractures in women.</seg>
<seg id="831">In the ProActive study, a study over 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures of 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 frames per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone were compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>

<seg id="1185">In patients with ischemic heart disease or abnormal heart failure the treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other acid-seed medicines, acute gout occurs during the treatment of treatment because of the reduction of the serum resin acid level, uric acid deposits can initially be mobilised in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in rare cases, the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases is so widespread that it comes to a deposition in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with febuxostat (3,5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to conduct a liver function test before beginning of the febuxostasis treatment and in the course of the course (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwar did not have any interaction studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to an increase of theophylite mirror (a blocking of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen was associated with an increase in Febuxostat (CMAx 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / cox-2 inhibitors was not related to a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorothiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient required at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x per day had an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decrease in CMAx by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not include side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal experimental studies do not have direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostasis group in the pivotal study of Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal correlation with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were arteriosklerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects that may arise in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg Febuxostat and which have been reported in all febuxostat treatment groups more than once are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients treated at the same time as Colchicin. * * In the clinical trials no serious rash or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open long-term extension studies In the open long term extension studies, 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated with febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The events related to long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all febuxosta- treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years), according to information.</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in pivotal studies of phase 3 or with a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, sleeplessness, hypnotesthesia, showy ECG, coughing, shortness of skin, protein urie, renal insufficiency, erectile dysfunction, increase in levels of potassium in the blood, decrease in lymphocyte number, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The active mechanism of uric acid is the final product of the purinmetabolism in humans and results in the hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid reaction process.</seg>

<seg id="1210">Clinical study results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">The primary efficacy endpoint was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month-specific serum acid levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) were present.</seg>

<seg id="1222">The data from the Phase 3 open elongation study showed that the permanent reduction of serum resin acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in less than 3% of patients required in the months of 16 to 24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not require treatment against gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the cornea, which resulted in 54% of patients a complete disappearance of the top grades up to 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased SHA values (&gt; 5.5 µW / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received allopurinol (5.8%) in open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (CMAx) and the area below the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Doses between 120 mg and 300 mg are observed for Febuxostat an increase in the AUC, which is larger than the dose proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the CMAx is about 2.8-3,2 µg / ml and 5.0-5,3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change in the percentage decrease in serum resin acid concentration was observed, provided that was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>

<seg id="1232">After intake of an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine found itself as unchanging Febuxostat (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the stools were found as unchanged Febuxostat (12%), Acylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), whose well-known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patient groups kidney failure After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe kidney failure, the CMAx of Febuxostat did not change in proportion to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>

<seg id="1236">12 Liver restriction after intake of multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- Pugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) Liver function restriction changed the CMAx and AUC from Febuxostat and its metabolites significantly compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">No significant changes were observed with regard to the AUC of Febuxostat or its metabolites after intake of multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In males, a statistically significant increase of urinary vesicles (transitional cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the high-dose treated group, at about 11-times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">In oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4,3 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by lowering the breeding performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in bearing rats with expositions, about 4.3-fold and with supporting rabbits with expositions, which amounted to about 13 times the human-therapeutic exposure, did not produce teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1251">The holder of approval for placing on the market has ensured that a pharmacovigilance system, as described in version 2.0 module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application, is ready before the drug is brought into circulation, and as long as the drug is brought into circulation.</seg>
<seg id="1252">According to the CHMP Guideline, an updated RMP is to be submitted to the risk management systems for human medicines with the next Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR).</seg>
<seg id="1253">In addition, an update of the RMP is required • if new information is available which have an impact on safety data, pharmacovigilance plan or risk minimization activities • within 60 days of reaching important milestones (pharmacovigilance or risk minimization) • on request of EMEA</seg>
<seg id="1254">In some people, uric acid accumulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that uric acid becomes insoluble.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you keep the uric acid concentration low through the 1 x daily intake of ADENURIC, the crystal formation is prevented and in this way, a reduction in the symptoms is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="1256">ADENURIC must not be taken if you are hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredient Febuxostat or any of the other components of ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Inform your doctor before you start taking this drug • if you have a heart weakness or have or suffer from any other heart problem. • If you are suffering from a high uric acid concentration in the wake of a cancer or the Lesch-Nyhan-Syndroms (a rare congenital disease in which there is too much uric acid in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="1258">If you have a gout attack at the moment (sudden occurrence of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, feeling of warmth and joint swelling), wait until the plaster fall is cleared before you start treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be the case with everyone, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">If necessary, your doctor will prescribe other medicines to prevent a gout attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / apply other medicines or have recently taken / used them, even if they are not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use any of the following substances, as interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor might consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurine (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">There were no studies on the effects of ADENURIC on the transport capacity and the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Please take ADENURIC first after consultation with your doctor if you know that you suffer from intolerance towards certain sugars.</seg>
<seg id="1265">On the back of the blister pack the individual weekdays are printed, so you can check if you have taken a tablet every day. • The tablets must be swallowed and can be taken with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1266">In case you have overdosed an overdose, contact your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital.</seg>
<seg id="1267">If you forgot to take ADENURIC, take it as soon as possible, unless the next intake is imminent.</seg>
<seg id="1268">If you break the intake of ADENURIC, your uric acid concentration may increase again, and your complaints can worsen because new primordial crystals can form in your joints and kidneys, as well as their surroundings.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since alendronate and vitamin D3 are already separated from each other in medicines approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the effectiveness of ADROVANCE regarding increasing vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After 15 weeks of treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those who only took Alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the alendronate dose contained in ADROVANCE meets the exact dose required to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints), and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (digestive disorders), ulcers (ulcera) of the oesophagus, dysphagia (swallowing disorders), beaten abdomen (bloated stomach) and acidic sensation.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) to alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other ingredients, ADROVANCE may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It should not be applied in cases of esophagus, in patients with hypokalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1287">ADROVANCE is only taken with water (not with mineral water) at least 30 minutes before the first meal, drink or intake of medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements) for the day.</seg>
<seg id="1288">The following guidelines are to be followed closely to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and associated side effects (see Section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• Patients should not chew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth, as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not lay down before the first food intake of the day, which is supposed to take 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except Pyloroplastic, only under special caution (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, oesophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal cords, were reported in patients under the seizure of alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible esophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out in the occurrence of symptoms of esophageal irritation like dysphagia, pain in swallowing or retrosternal pain or a new or worsening heartburn of the medicine and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe gastro-hageal side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue taking it after symptoms associated with esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical trials with alendronate no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcera, among them some serious and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteonecrosis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimens contains mainly IV-administered bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the onset of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure reduce the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapeutic planning of each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning with a dose of ADROVANCE after having noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases which affect mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and drinks (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may interfere with the absorption of alendronate if they are taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not conducted, alendronate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or by breastfeeding women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with alendronate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteonosis of the jaw was reported in patients under bisphosphonates; most reports were reported by cancer patients, but it was also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>
<seg id="1308">Nevertheless, the serum calciums up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl (2.0 mmol / l) and the sera phosphate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl (0.65 mmol / l) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency.</seg>

<seg id="1311">The main effect of vitamin D3 is the rise of the intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate as well as the regulation of serum calcium, the renal excretion of calcium and phosphate, bone formation and bone resorption.</seg>
<seg id="1312">In severe cases, a deficiency may lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism, hypophosphatemia, weakness of the proximal musculature and osteomal acia, and thus to an increased risk of falls and fractures in osteoporotic individuals.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure to tacrolimus, this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1416">In day 4, systemic exposure, measured as a valley mirror, was comparable to both in both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate aftercare phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a substance with low clearances, an adjustment of the Advagraph can scheme may take several days until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">Duration of application To suppress the graft rejection, immunosuppression must be maintained; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Dose recommendations - kidney transplant prophylaxis of transplant rejection The oral Advagraph therapy should start with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dose adjustments may be necessary later, as the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus can change in the course of the patient's stabilization after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dose recommendations - Liver transplantation Prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraph therapy should start with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf Must must be converted from twice daily dose of Prograf Capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraf, so this change in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg) has to be done in relation to the entire daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplant After switching from other immunosuppressiva to advant once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplants must begin for prophylaxis of transplant rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">An oral initiation dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily in the case of adult patients who are converted to Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advant in lung, pankreas- and gut-transplanted patients, Prograf was applied in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in patients with transplanted transplanted patients in an oral initiation dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dose adjustments in special patient groups with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function As the renal function has no influence on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, a careful monitoring of the kidney function (including a regular determination of the serum creatine capsule, a calculation of the creatine capsule, and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf In switching from a Ciclosporin- to a tacrolimus-based therapy is advisable (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in the individual case with the help of thoroughbred-Tacrolimus-talmirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after switching from Prograf to Advagraph, dose adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy, or by using substances which could change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since Advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the level levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the valley levels of Tacrolimus during the first time after liver transplants are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with transplant and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of tacrolimus or over-exposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; Modification of the formulation or régime should only be performed under close inspection of a physician experienced in transplantation (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 In order to treat adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be effective against other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">There are no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf for prophylaxis of transplant rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effects of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may be avoided (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases a chamber or septum hypertrophy described as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to appropriate clothing or use of sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies that are known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and therefore increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while simultaneously offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage to maintain constant concentrations accordingly (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or lower the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase the level of hormone levels, decisions regarding contraceptive measures must be particularly cautious.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus potentially decreases the Clearance of Pentobarbital and Phenazone and prolongs its half-life time.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of transplant patients are not suggesting that, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1467">It was reported about benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV- associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumours in combination with the treatment with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Because of its high molecular weight, low water solubility and high binding to erythrocytes and plasma proteins, tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At a molecular level the effects of tacrolimus can be mediated by binding to a cytosolan protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cellular interior.</seg>

<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus suppresses the activation of T cells and proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, as well as the formation of lymphocytes (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) and the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="1472">12 confirmed acute rejection was 29.3% in the first 24 weeks in the Advagraph Group (N = 237) 32,6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1473">The patients survival rates after 12 months were 89.2% for Advagraf and 90,8% for Prograf; in the Advagraf Arm 25 (14 females, 11 men) and in Prograf Arm 24 (5 women, 19 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Kidney transplant The efficacy and safety of Advagraf and Prograf was compared in combination with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and corticosteroids, at 667 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Patients with survival rates after 12 months were 96.9% for Prograf and 99.5% for Prograf; in the Advagraf Arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in Prograf Arm 8 (3 women, 5 men) died.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The efficacy and safety of Prograf, Ciclosporin and Advagraf was compared with Basiliximab antibody induction, MMF and corticosteroids, at 638 de novo kidney transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The incidence of therapy failure after 12 months (defined as death, loss of graft, biopsy-confirmed acute rejection or missing follow-up data) was 14.0% in the Advagraph Group (N = 214), 15.1% in the Prograf group (N = 212) and 17.0% in the Ciclosporin group (N = 212).</seg>
<seg id="1478">The treatment difference was -3.0% (Advagraph Ciclosporin) (95.2% confidence interval [-9.9%, 4,0%]) for Advagraf vs Ciclosporin and -1.9% (Prograf-Ciclosporin) (95.2%) for Prograf vs Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1479">In the Advagraph Arm 3 (men), in Prograf Arm 10 (3 women, 7 men) and in the Ciclosporin arm 6 (3 women, 3 men) were killed.</seg>
<seg id="1480">Published results of primary immunosuppression with tacrolimus in the form of Prograf, applied twice a day after other primary organ transplants, has become a recognized primary immunosuppressant after pancreas, lung and intestinal transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1481">175 patients, 475 patients undergoing pancreas transplantation and enrolled in 630 patients as primary immunosuppressant in 630 cases.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf in these published studies corresponded to observations in the major studies in which Prograf was used for liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multicentre study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported which received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic corneal graft rejection, the obliteral syndrome, was less common in the first year following the transplant (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus- and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treponet al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus, in 21,7% of the cases of obliterans of bronchiolitis compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be changed to Tacrolimus was significantly higher (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was greater after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) of patients with the Tacrolimus-Group (Trek et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis was significantly lower in the patients treated with Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">A multicentre study with oral prograf was performed in 205 patients, who at the same time underwent pancreas and kidney transplantation following a randomized method of tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initiation dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached to achieve the desired level levels from 8 to 15 ng / ml at 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplants showed an actual survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow enlargement, additional administration of the interleukin-2 antagonist Daclizumab, lower initial doses of 10 and 15 ng / ml and more recently transplanted radiation (Abu-Elmagd et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as a low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of tacrolimus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids are to be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby the excretion is mainly done via bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">For stable patients who were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to an average daily dose of 1: 1 (mg: mg) relative to the total daily dose, systemic exposure to Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be a therapy resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1500">28 confirmed acute rejection was 29.3% in the first 24 weeks in the Advagraph Group (N = 237) 32,6% and in the Prograf group (N = 234) 29.3%.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advise is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (due to the lack of factor VIII conditional, congenital heart defect disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">Dosage and frequency of application depends on whether Advantages are used to treat bleeding or prevent bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but manufactured according to a method known as recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which enabled it to form the human clotting factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advise is similar to a medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced differently so that the drug contains no proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the effectiveness of Advantages in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood samples has been awarded "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of Advantages (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Do not apply in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted approval to Baxter AG for the transfer of lawyers across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period should not fall below the given plasma level (in% of the standard or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer, until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Injections repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the danger for the patient is over.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, a reasonable determination of the factor VIII plasma level is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in response to factor VIII, reach different in vivo recovery and have different half-life times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis For long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, doses between 20 and 40 I.E. of factor VIII per kg body weight should be given at a distance of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if bleeding is not controlled by a reasonable dose, a test must be carried out to prove an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The rate of injection should depend on the patient's condition, whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always present against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII-directed IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma via modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, although the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and an amnestic known inhibitor development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, recurrence of (low-tide) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women, there are no experiences about the use of Factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">The most common ADRs were inhibitors against Factor VIII (5 patients), who all occurred in previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated on the basis of the sum of individual patients (234) The unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-mirror occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperative day) in a patient with continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- levels in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient levels on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2,4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days with ADVATE.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) were detected by prior exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days) a FVIII inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical study 5 out of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients with inhibitors against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The immune response of patients on traces of contamination proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant uptrend as well as a continued peak of antibody levels against anti-CHO cell protein, but otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that were indicative of an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, pruritus, rash and increased number of eosinophilic granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the scope of the study.</seg>
<seg id="1566">7 As with other intravenous products, ADVATE reported over hypersensitivity reactions of the allergic type, including anaphylactic / anaphylactic reactions (frequency not known).</seg>
<seg id="1567">The activated Factor VIII acts as a co-factor for the activated Factor IX and accelerates the formation of activated factor X out of factor X.</seg>
<seg id="1568">All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in pre-treated patients with severe or moderate haemophilia A (basic factor of factor VIII activity ≤ 2%).</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP further evaluated the benefit-risk weighing as positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP based on ADVATE's safety profile, which requires a PSURs filing every 6 months, decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company resumes its application for the transfer of Advexin to the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (tissue that connects and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"" "the virus in Advexin is an" "" "Adenovirus" "", "which has been modified in such a way that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can not cause infections in humans." ""</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advin could have been injected directly into the tumors, enabling cancer cells to re-form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene that is not broken in the human body normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is broken, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni cancer occurred in the area of undergrowth, bones and brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had reviewed the company's answers to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the assessment of the initially submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">The CHMP opinion was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumours provides benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the treatment of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company did not prove sufficient that Advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is harmful either for the environment or for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not know whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified" "" "release means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents aged 12 and over, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet, which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (blocked nose), are clutched.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can cause the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy endpoints were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all hayfever symptoms besides constipation of the nose, the patients who received aero aze reported a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0%, compared with 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was observed, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who took Desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (drowsiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another drug used for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">It may also not be used in patients who suffer from narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), heart disease or vascular disease including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyrosis (hyperthyroiosis), hyperthyrosis (cerebral haemorrhages), or have a risk of an hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to SP Europe for the transport of Aerinaze in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is to swallow in the whole (i.e. without biting, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy, Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms sound.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application duration to 10 days, as long-term use may reduce the activity of pseudoephedrine with time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within the 2 weeks after termination of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, Pergolid, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestive pills (phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxyacetazoline, napalolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy have not been checked for this patient population, and the data does not suffice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of Aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data does not suffice to provide appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment must be discontinued in case of hypertension or tachycardia, palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headache).</seg>
<seg id="1677">Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck sobbing, or bronchospasm in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is present at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the context of clinical trials with desloratadin, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of Desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with desloratadin and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether or not desloratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of Desloratadin has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines cannot be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">Desloratadin does not inhibit in-vivo CYP3A4, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The inconvenience of using Aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, did not increase the frequency of abnormalities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans, and because of the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to a dizziness, which may result in an impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental attention, cyanose, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible lethal sequences.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headaches, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, excitation, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, preoperative pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary rigidity and - dilatation, skin redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basedophiles and the inhibition of expression of the adhesion-molecule P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flow rates, including amplification of subjective msleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg. a day.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestation of a CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of Aerinaze tablets, determined by the overall score for the symptoms (except nasal mucosa swelling), was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine during the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined on the basis of the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerobic tablets showed no significant differences in terms of sex, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the framework of a single dose study on the pharmacokinetics of Aerinaze, Desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of the administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the oral application of Aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the floating balance of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">As part of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study, which was conducted with the formulation as tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects of desloratadin were poorly metabolised.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (CMAx and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine was bioequivalent to the exposure of an Aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">However, based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of lauatadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and the pharmacovigilance system described in Module 1 8.1 of the marketing application is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerinaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itchy nose and tearing or itchy eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1709">Inform your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or are diagnosed with you in the application of Aerinaze: • high blood pressure • heart rate, palpitations • heart rhythm disorders • nausea and headaches, or strengthening of existing headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1710">When taking Aerinaze with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1711">In case of use in the recommended dosage, it is not to be expected that Aerinaze will lead to dizziness or reduce the attention.</seg>
<seg id="1712">If you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should inform your doctor or pharmacist immediately if you have taken a larger amount of Aerinaze than you should.</seg>
<seg id="1713">If you forgot to take a dose of Aerinaze, if you forgot to take a dose in time, take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time.</seg>
<seg id="1714">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Heart chasing, restlessness with increased physical activity, dry mouth, dizziness, sore throat, loss of appetite, constipation, sugar in urine, increased blood sugar levels, thirst, fatigue, headache, sleep disorders, nervousness, and dizziness.</seg>
<seg id="1716">Palpitations or arrhythmias, increased physical activity, redness, hot flushes, confusion, blurred vision, nasal bleeding, nasal irritation, throat infections, nasal irritation, muzzle syndrome, decreased sense of smell, abnormal liver values, restlessness, anxiety and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions (breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart chasing, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, upset stomach, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of eye-catching liver enzymes was also very rare reported.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as a 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg / ml syrup tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as a 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup, respectively.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between the ages of six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4,800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four trials of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies involving asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">Efficacy was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrants, impairment of sleep and performance on day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to take and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average decrease in the symptoms scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to the decline of 12 to 26% in patients who received placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In both studies at Urticaria, the decline in the symptoms scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Erius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Aerius throughout the European Union to the company SP Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, for relief of symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and Urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on the effectiveness of the use of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be done according to the previous disease process and can be terminated after the symptoms have been removed and resumed when reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In case of the persisting allergic rhinitis (symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks), the patient can be recommended a continuous treatment during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not ascertained in clinical studies with Desloratadin tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, while taking Aerius and alcohol, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not reinforced (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to dizziness, which may result in an impairment of the transport capacity or the ability to operate machines.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in different indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side-effects reported in patients with Aerius were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly encountered adverse events reported more often than placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study of 578 adolescents aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headache, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and in 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study that administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basedophiles and the inhibition of expression of the adhesion-molecule P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In a clinical study with multiple doses given in desloratadin administered up to 20 mg. a day over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) over ten days, there was no extension of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of flow rates, including amplification of subjective msleepiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may be divided depending on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistible allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persisting allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria became representative for further forms of urticaria, because the underlying pathophysiology in spite of etiology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be easily recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since the history of history is a causal factor in all causal diseases, it is expected that in addition to Chronic idiopathic urticaria, in other forms of urticaria, it is also expected to improve symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing the size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronically idiopathic urticaria the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improved itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and alertness, as measured by a 4-point scale to evaluate these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study in which patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients reached a higher concentration of Desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant accumulation following once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Desloratadin in-vivo not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dose of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, high-calorie breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The pre-clinical studies conducted with Desloratadin and Loratadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1762">Colourless film (contains lactose-monohydrate, hypromless, titanium dioxide, Macrogol 400, Indigocarmin (E 132)), colourless film (contains hypromless, Macrogol 400), carnauba wax, light wax.</seg>
<seg id="1763">Erius can be taken independently of meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persisting allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that no data is available that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years are metabolizing desloratadin and experiencing higher substance levels (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius Sirup in children between 2 and 11 years, which is fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who are metabolized normally.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol, so patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-insufficiency should not use this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not detected in clinical studies with Aerius tablets, in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical pharmacological study, taking Aerius tablets and alcohol did not increase the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Aerius syrup group, similar to the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rhinitis and Chronic idiopathic urticaria were reported at the recommended dose of 3% more side effects in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study involving adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-times clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti-histamine therapy received a daily desloratadine dose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of Desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">There was no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect described in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the desloratadin administered up to 20 mg. a day over 14 days.</seg>

<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials, at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1779">At an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not adversely affect psychomotics.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical pharmacological studies in adults, simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in drowsiness due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>

<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolizing phenotype was similar to adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater with black (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with the syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) through Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the CMAx was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of about 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant drug accumulation following once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 In several single dose studies, the AUC and CMAx values of Desloratadin in paediatric patients were comparable to those of adults who received the Desloratadin syrup in a dose of 5 mg.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. announced the approval of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the Company resumes its application for permission to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly to protect against flu caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special type of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus occurs, which can easily spread from human to human, because humans have no immunity (no protection) on the other hand.</seg>
<seg id="1897">Following the vaccine, the immune system recognises the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as "foreign body" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system will later be able to form antibodies with a flu virus in contact with a flu virus.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane cover of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface which the human body recognises as a foreign body) has been purified and used as part of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">A survey of some of the study centers showed that the study was not conducted according to "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data basis for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in a clinical examination and need more information about your treatment, please contact your attending doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over the age of four who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but it cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination was not investigated.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Generic Agenerase should only be prescribed once the doctor has checked the antiviral medication used by the patient and the likelihood of the virus being addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice daily, which together with twice daily 100 mg ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines are taken.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children aged between 4 and 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of aeriase is based on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, aeriase decreases the HIV-amount in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids do not cure AIDS, but can delay the damage of the immune system and the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Aeriase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The antibody increased with low dose ritonavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the modification of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load less than 400 copies / ml than placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the use of ritonavir increased the viral load after 16-week treatment just as effective as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">Patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, came under Agenerase together with Ritonavir to a stronger anti-viral load after four weeks compared to those who continued their previous protease inhibitor:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of aeriase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (fatigue).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Aeriase must also not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for treating depression) or medicines that are broken down in the same way as Agenerase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take aeriase have the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the recovering immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of agenerase in use in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used to treat HIV-1 infected adults and children aged over four years are predominant.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Aeriase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic reinforcer Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of agenerase in combination with ritonavir in patients who previously had not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission granted approval to Glaxo Group Limited by the European Commission for the marketing of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines to treat HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pretreated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Generic Agenerase capsules are usually to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution for intake is 14% less than from amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram pro milligram are not interchangeable (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agaase capsules is 600 mg amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the intensifying addition of ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of aeriase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agaase capsules is 20 mg amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetic, efficacy and safety of aeriase in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Aeriase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate hepatic dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be taken care of in patients with mild or moderate hepatic dysfunctions, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a diminished therapeutic effect of amprenavir during the seizure of amprenavir (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be noted that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including the treatment with aeriase does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Generic Agenerase capsules are usually used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal disease.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant medical information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">As the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, an concurrent administration of asterase with lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International Regised Ratio), methods for determining the substance concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, amperase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amprenavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the nature of the interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycol content of the aeriase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Aeriase should be removed in the duration of 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia, or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were required to treat medicines which are associated with the development of a diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. Higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophile patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous haematoma and haemarthrosis.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is adopted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol intake, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteonosteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given at the same time using medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with a low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir resulting in virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the degraded plasma levels by means of a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, unwanted effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the amprenavirus levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508%, by contrast, increased by 30% for CMAx when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg amprenavir were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily, which prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% degradation when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with caletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in the plasma, which were achieved in the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than when amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) is given twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and Kaletra cannot be given, however, it is recommended a close-meshed monitoring because the effectiveness and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study used to use aeriase in combination with didanosin, but due to the antachine component of Didanosin it is recommended that the revenue of didanosin and aeriase are at least an hour apart (see Antachda below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">For this reason, in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with amfavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended, as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is required as delaviruses could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">Caution is required if these medicines are used together; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir is difficult on Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous injection of amprenavir and Rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193%, resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended, although no clinical data is available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with aeriase in combination with erythromycin were not performed, however, the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous use of 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ritonavir with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-gland) once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines which are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions in common with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Therefore, patients should be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these medicines if they are used in combination with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as aeriase since it can come to resorption dysfunctions.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulsants known as enzyme-inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, ripendipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Concurrent intake with aeriase can considerably increase the plasma concentrations and strengthen the associated side effects including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous dose of aeriase with ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the possible benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected while taking Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">As plasma level increases in these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of this drug is not recommended with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">Frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilising the mirrors is recommended, as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the same dose of amprenavir (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used in combination with oral Midazolam (see Section 4.3), while with simultaneous use of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should therefore be monitored for piracy symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of ritonavir administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adapt amprenevir- dose if amprenavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">In the case of warfarin or other oral anticoagulae along with aeriase, increased control of INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening of the anti-thrombotic effect (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example desipramine and nortryptilin) is recommended while taking Agenerase (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful consideration of potential benefits for the mother compared to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">Amprenavir-related substances have been detected in the milk of lactation rats, however, it is not known whether amprenavir is passed into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproductive study on pregnant rats, which was administered by the implantation in the uterus until the end of the lactation of amprenavir, showed a diminished increase in 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the mother's animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and in children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most of the side effects associated with the aeriase treatment were mild to moderate, occurred early and rarely led to abortion.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are in connection with the use of Agenerase or another drug used at the same time, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below come from two clinical trials (PROJ3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg of Agenerase twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (degree 2 to 4), which were assessed by the investigators as in connection with the study medication, and occurred in more than 1% of the patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring under the treatment (degree 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (Lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and facial subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral adipose tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and thorny fat accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral not pretreated subjects treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / Zidovuddin for a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stiernisation) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the trial PROAB 3006 in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients with amprenavir 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 cases (11%) in 241 patients under inDinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makulopapules nature, with or without itching and usually appeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amprenavir had to be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteonosteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In PI treated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice daily with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of side effects (Grade 2 to 4) and laboratory changes (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those observed in patients who received aeriase along with low dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient must be observed at signs of an intoxication (see section 4.8) if necessary, necessary supporting measures can be initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thus prevents the processing of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyproteins with the result of an unripe, non infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was studied in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmconduction (IC50) of amprenavir is in the range of 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acutely infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells.</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of Amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir-dosages - as with other Ritonavir stained treatment schemas with protease inhibitors - the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Sixteen out of 434 antiretroviral not previously treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study occurred a virological failure up to week 48, with 14 isolates genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children, in which a viral failure occurred within the 59 included patients with protease inhibitors, showed resistance patterns similar to those observed in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, M36I, M46I / L, I47V, G48V, I50V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients treated with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, I62V, M36I, I84V and L90M in combination with increased phenotypic resistance on Fosamprenavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amprenavir / ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with proteasinhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypic cut-offs for FPV / RTV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four genes with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on the cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not pretreated patients, in which a Fosamprenevirus failed (one of them demonstrated a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir (one of 25 isolates), indinavir / ritonavir (three of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the other hand, amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasms-resistant isolates; maintaining this activity seems dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early breakage of a failing therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The receipt of the efficacy of aeriase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PROPH17, a randomised open study, in which with PI pre-treated adults after virological failure (Viruslast ≥ 1000 copies / ml), either Agenerase (600 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidanoga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, mainly with low-dose ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, in case of a non-leakage threshold of 0,4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of untreated aeriase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pretreated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase was examined for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice a day, whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">No low dose ritonavir was given at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs associated with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase in the CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of" "" "unroasted" "" "aeriase should be considered in therapy optimisation with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral dosing, the average duration (tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir takes about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">508%, by contrast, increased by 30% for CMAx when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, minimal concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by food intake, although simultaneous intake influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration by amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage of free active constituents fluctuates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range of CMAx, ss up to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 need to be administered with care if they are given at the same time as Agenerase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of aeriase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, results in a similar daily amprenavir exposure, as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; therefore, aeriase solution and aeriase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram-basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal Clearance of Ritonavir is also negligible, so the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amprenavir plasma levels comparable to those found in healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg amprenavir twice daily without the simultaneous administration of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies of carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, benign hepatocellular adenomas occurred in male animals, who spoke to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg amprenavir.</seg>

<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) have not been achieved either after a single or repeated topical application, no recommendation can be given during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine-cream in related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions to the site of the treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream in the related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basal patients treated with Imiquimodine-cream from a placebo-controlled phase III clinical study reported side-effects below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probably or possibly with the application of imiquimodine-cream in the related side effect were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimodine).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimodine treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">This evaluation of clinical signs foreseen by the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical studies with Imiquimodine-cream there are often local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excloriation / branching (23%) and edema (14%) (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the study plan, clinical evidence suggests that in these studies, five-week treatment with iiquimodine-cream often leads to severe Erycles (31%), severe erosion (13%), and severe scarring and sticking (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the use of iiquimodine for the treatment of actin keratosis, alopecia was detected with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental unique oral recording of 200 mg of imiquimodine, corresponding to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, persisted in hypotony, normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Pharmacokinetic examination showed increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interferons and other cytokines following the topical application of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies, it was shown that the efficacy in regards to a complete healing of the genital warts during an iiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is significantly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">60% of patients treated with iiquimiodine treated patients completely; this was the case with 20% of the patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with imiquimine treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine at five times a week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were immunohistologically confirmed single primary basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%) of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week, treatment-free time period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, non-hypertrophic active lesions within a related 25 cm2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The permitted indications of external tilt, actin keratose and basal cell carcinoma do not normally occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials involving children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The effectiveness of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages studied there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">Minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimodine cream by the skin of 58 patients with actin keratosis was observed during the three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totaled 0.1, 0.2 and 1,6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life time was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous application in an earlier study; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-diseased skin of patients at the age of 6 - 12 years and comparable with that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or superfial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study on the dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study conducted for the dermal application, conducted for four months, did not result in similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours to the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagen, a risk for man due to systemic exposure can be regarded as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in greater number than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>
<seg id="2242">It can hurt other people even if they have the same symptoms as you. - If any of the side effects you have significantly impacted or you notice side effects not indicated in this use information, please inform your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2243">● Feigwarts (condylomata acuminata) formed on the skin in the area of genitals (sexual organs) and anus (anus) ● superficial basal cell carcinoma This is a frequently encountered, slow-growing form of skin cancer with very little likelihood of spreading to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If left untreated, it can lead to distortion, especially in the face - hence an early detection and treatment is important.</seg>
<seg id="2245">Actinic keratoses are rough areas of the skin, which occur in people who were exposed to much sunlight during their previous life.</seg>
<seg id="2246">Aldara should only be used in flat akine keratoses in the face and on scalp in patients with a healthy immune system, where your doctor has decided that Aldara is the most suitable treatment for you.</seg>
<seg id="2247">Aldara Cream promotes your body's own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body fight the superficial basal cell carcinoma, the actinic keratose or the virus responsible for the infection.</seg>
<seg id="2248">O If you have previously used aldara cream or other similar preparations, please inform your doctor about this before you start treatment. o inform your doctor if you have problems with your immune system. o Avoid contact with eyes, lips and nasal mucosa.</seg>

<seg id="2250">Once the reactions are cloned, you can continue the treatment. consult your doctor if they have no normal blood pattern</seg>
<seg id="2251">If this daily cleaning under the foreskin is not carried out, swelling, thinning of the skin or difficulty of retracting the foreskin may be expected with an increased appearance of the foreskin.</seg>
<seg id="2252">Do not use Aldara cream in the urethra, vagina (vagina), cervix (cervix) or within anus (anus).</seg>
<seg id="2253">Taking other medications has serious problems with your immune system, you should use this medication for not more than one treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2254">If you have sexual intercourse during the infection with genital warts, the treatment with Aldara cream after the sexual intercourse (not before) must be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you have other medicines or have recently used it, even if it is not a prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2256">Do not quench your baby during treatment with Aldara cream, since it is not known whether imiquimodine passes into breast milk.</seg>
<seg id="2257">The frequency and duration of the treatment varies according to prewarts, basal cell carcinoma and actin keratose (see specific instructions for each application area).</seg>
<seg id="2258">Apply a thin layer of Aldara cream to the clean, dry skin area with the tilt warts and rub the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed.</seg>
<seg id="2259">Men with genital warts under the foreskin need to withdraw the foreskin every day and wash the skin area underneath (see section 2 "What do you have to consider before applying Aldara Cream?").</seg>
<seg id="2260">Please talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have the impression that the effect of Aldara is too strong or too weak.</seg>
<seg id="2261">For 6 weeks a sufficient amount of Aldara cream can be applied for 5 days per week in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you feel uncomfortable during the use of Aldara cream.</seg>
<seg id="2264">If your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Aldara cream, you should not use the cream any further, wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2265">A degraded number of blood cells can make you more susceptible to infections; it can cause you to create a blue stain faster or cause depression.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Tell your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2267">In addition, you may feel itching (32% of the patients), burning (26% of patients) or pain in the areas you have applied Aldara cream (8% of patients).</seg>
<seg id="2268">Usually these are lighter skin reactions which end up after the treatment within 2 weeks after the treatment is finished.</seg>
<seg id="2269">Some patients notice changes in the application location (wound secretion, inflammation, swelling, scorn formation, skin irritation, blisters, dermatitis) or irritability, nausea, dry mouth, flu-like symptoms and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2270">Occasionally, some patients suffer from changes in the application site (bleeding, inflammation, wound secretion, ulceration, sensation of scorn and scarring), inflammation of the nasal mucosa, nasal irritation, swelling of the eyelids, sore throat, diarrhea, ulcers, body aches, fever, weakness or shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2271">Aldurazyma is used for enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not broken down and therefore accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non-neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, which complicate movements, decreased lung capacity, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyma should be monitored by a physician who possesses experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyma should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitation devices, and patients may need medicines to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly investigates the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect on reducing the GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyms lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyma in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthralgia (joint pain), back pain, pain in the limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions to the infusion station.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, decreased oxygen saturation (a measure of the lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyma may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year all new information that may be known and, where necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The producer of Aldurazyms will observe patients who receive aldurazyms with regard to the reactions to infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit to Genzyme Europe B.V. to transfer Aldurazyms to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammalian cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyma is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyma should be done by a physician who possesses experience in treating patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient is wearing this, every 15 minutes in single steps can be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in adults over 65 years has not been determined, and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyma in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined, and no dosage schedule could be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Alduracyma may develop fusion-related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during infusion or until the end of the infusion (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored, and the infusion of Aldurazyms should only take place in an appropriate clinical environment where revitation facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">As a result of the phase 3 clinical trial, nearly all patients with IgG antibodies against laronidase are expected to be present, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-induced reaction must be treated with caution when using alduracyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a prolonged period of interruption, the theoretically elevated risk of a hypersensitivity reaction after an interruption of treatment must be performed cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting the infusion with medication (antihistaminika and / or antipyreka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a slight or moderate infusion-induced reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction of the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-induced reaction the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms have fallen, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction of the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) and a reduction in infusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquine or procaine because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not result in direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyma.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were predominantly reported as infusion-related responses, which were observed in 53% of patients in the phase 3 study (treatment duration of up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment time of up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions in connection with alduracyms observed during the Phase 3 study and their prolongation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older with a treatment duration of up to 4 years are shown in the following table: very common (≥ 1 / 10); frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, respiration and facial edema (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted Drug Reactions related to Aldurazyms, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe expiration and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion occurred within 3 months following the beginning of the treatment, with a more severe inversion in the age of 5 years (average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the phase 3 study (or early withdrawal from the study) 13 / 45 patients did not present detectable antibodies by radioimmunohistochemistry (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with whom it never came to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titres a variable reduction of GAG in urine was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginally to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic larvae activity in vitro that seemed to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The rationale for the enzyme therapy is in one for the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrata and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After intravenous infusion, laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation system and cells entered into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6 minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms every week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyma showed improvement in lung function and the capacity to be cured in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">An improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically not statistically significant over this period and the absolute lung volume increases further proportionally to the height of children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">From 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease in the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg creatinine) was determined, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">Regarding the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into consideration clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal FEV, distance in the 6-minute walk, range of motion of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years (16 patients with the severe current form and 4 with the mean follow-up form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients, the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg because of increased Gag- Mirrors in Harn in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a growth rate (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) was determined according to the Z-score for this age group The younger patients with the moderate follow-up form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed a normal mental development rate, whereas in older patients with severe delay, only limited or no progress in cognitive development was detected.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of different Alduracyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be a justifiable alternative in patients who have difficulty with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing regimens is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to older and less affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in a unique application, toxicity in repeated administration and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with Cisplatin (another drug for cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (cancer) or malignant (cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as a therapy for patients who have not previously been treated, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">To reduce side effects, patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and get injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the administration of cisplatin, an "anti-emetic drug" should be added (remedy against vomiting) and fluids (to prevent a fluid deficiency).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be delayed, removed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed also slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of pemetrexed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with Cisplatin in 1 725 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with cancer did not attack squamous cell proliferation in the administration of Alimta for longer survival times than with the comparative medicine.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to transport Alimta to the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each cup has to be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride (9 mg / ml), which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosages is taken from the cup and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with lung or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given on the day before and on the day of the pemetrexed dose and on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period and for another 21 days after the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) per week prior to the first pemetrexed dose and after every third operation cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients who receive pemetrexed, a complete blood flow should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and platelet count.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment course a dose examination must take place taking into account the Nadirs of the blood-image or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery, patients must be further treated in accordance with the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Level 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">If patients with non-hematological toxicity (except neurotoxicity) develop (except neurotoxicity), the treatment must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA needs to be aborted if an hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity degrees 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 doses or 4 or 4 neurotoxicity in the presence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical trials showed no indication that patients with 65 years of age or more than 65 years of age have an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinine-Clearance ≥ 45 ml / min which exceed the dose adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a Kreatinin Clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5-times of the upper Bilirubin- limit value and / or Transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0-times of the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone-bone and pemetrexed should not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophils again have a value ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte count again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the needle of absolute neutrophils, thrombocyte count and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in the previous cycles of treatment (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 hematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was treated after a pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients with pemetrexed patients need to be instructed to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as prophylactic measures to reduce the treatment-related toxicity (see Section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (CSAIDs) like ibuprofen and acetylsaliva cyllic acid (&gt; 1,3 g a day) must be avoided for at least 2 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with pemetrexed therapy must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the incidence of renal events, including dehydration, pre-existing high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the ergometer before the pemetrexed treatment should be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the translatinal space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetrexed, if this substance was usually given in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated life vaccines (excluding yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible degradation of the reproductive-ability by pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the treatment regiment to get advice regarding the sperm conserving.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs like ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid (≥ 1.3 g daily) can result in reduced pemetre deposition with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is therefore advisable to apply high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid in high doses for patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the treatment, be avoided on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with pemetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data is present with NSAIDs with a long half-life like Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, simultaneous use with Pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy necessitates increased monitoring frequency of INR (International Regised Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren Antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnant women.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed may not be used during pregnancy except when necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of foetus (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive-ability by pemetrexed, men should be pointed out before the beginning of the treatment to collect advice regarding the sperm conversion.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetrexed migrates into the mother's milk and unwanted effects of the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma, and the randomized Cisplatin and Pemetrexed and 163 patients with mesothelioma who received randomized cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2430">Cases of radionitis were reported in patients who were beamed before, during or after their pemetrexed therapy (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is a antineoplastic antiseptic, which exerts its effect by interrupting important follicles-dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetrexed acts as an anti-folate with multiple attack points by blocking the thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and glycinamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the folate-dependent key enzymes of de novo biosynthesis of thymidin- and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, single-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin against Cisplatin in chemonaïve patients with malignant pleuramesothelioma showed that patients with ALIMTA and Cisplatin had clinically meaningful survival compared to those treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received the investigational medicine during the treatment arm (randomized and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">Statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) in connection with the malignant pleural othelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms were improved by improving the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and worsening lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicentre, randomised, open phase III study with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC after previous chemotherapy was median survival of patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>
<seg id="2438">An analysis of the influence of histology on the overall survival fell in favor of ALIMTA in patients with NSCLC with a predominantly non-platepithelial histological type (n = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.61-1.00, p = 0.047) in patients with squamous cell carcinoma (n = 1.56; 95% CI = 1.08-2,26, p = 0.018).</seg>

<seg id="2501">Dissolve the content of 500 mg / ml bottles with sodium chloride (9 mg / ml) without preservatives, which results in a solution with a concentration of approximately 25 mg / ml of pemetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2502">The resulting solution is clear and the colouration ranges from colourless to yellow or greenish-yellow without compromising the quality of the products.</seg>
<seg id="2503">It is used in obese adults with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low calorie, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2504">Patients who are allergic to Alli and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they cannot metabolise certain fats in food, thus giving approximately a quarter of the fats supplied with food undigested the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared with a BMI of 25 to 28 kg / m2 with placebo in 391 overweight patients.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies involving a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 no weight loss was observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily patches of anus, flatus (winch) with bowel movement, bowel movement, oily / oily chair, bowlulence (winch), flatulence (winch) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be applied in patients who are treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may also not be applied in patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or in cholestase (liver disease), and in pregnant women or nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission granted approval to Glaxo Group Limited by the European Commission for placing Orlistat GSK in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for the weight reduction of adults with overweight (BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in combination with a slightly hypokaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, as there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">However, since orlistat is only minimised, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in elderly people and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous Treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.5) • Chronic Malabsorption syndrome • Stuptime (see Section 4.6) • Premature treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Section4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction may be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a drug against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting treatment with alli, because the dosage of antidiabetics needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who use alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of this drug has to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional anti-pregnancy measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction of Ciclosporin plasma levels was observed in a study on drug interactions and in several cases using orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">For the use of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (internationally standardized ratio, INR) might be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended to take an additional multivitamin supplement before bedtime in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the gift of a one-time dose Amiodarone, a minor decrease in amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies did not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and coincide with the pharmacological effect of the drug as the absorption of captured fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of adverse events reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of a certain size.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of potential and actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">Most of the cases of orlistat overdose reported after the market have either reported no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by orlistat properties can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect relies on the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastrischen and pankreatic lipass.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical trials have shown that 60 mg orlistat is taken three times a day, the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fat is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled adults with BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, oily-induced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight versus the initial value (at the time of randomisation) was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the study course (Table 1) and as percentage of those participants who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies, the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average dietary change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5,26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline 3,41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At the waist circumference, the average change -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting value of 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in the plasma could only be sporadically and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any signs of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolyzed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-Formyl Leucine group), were identified in a study with obese patients, which represented approximately 42% of total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2571">If you omit a meal or eat no fat, do not take a capsule. alli can only work when the food contains fat.</seg>
<seg id="2572">If you take the capsule in connection with a meal containing too much fat, you risk diet-related accompanying symptoms (see Section 4).</seg>

<seg id="2586">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if any of the side effects you notice significantly affects you or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information.</seg>
<seg id="2587">The most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and result in increasing fat from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2588">These side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the start of treatment, as you may have not consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet.</seg>
<seg id="2589">With the following basic rules, you can learn to minimize the diet-related accompanying symptoms: • Begin already a few days or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2590">If you know exactly how much you eat, the likelihood that you are going to exceed your fat limit decreases. • Share your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal, not to take it in the form of a fat-rich main dish or a holding table, as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction. • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur, learn to control these with time by adjusting their diet.</seg>

<seg id="2597">Select meals that contain a wide range of nutrients, and gradually learn to eat healthily.</seg>
<seg id="2598">Energy is also measured in kilojoules, which you also find in food packaging. • The recommended calorie intake indicates how many calories you should consume a maximum of calories per day.</seg>
<seg id="2599">Note the tables below in this section. • The recommended intake of fat in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Please refer to the information below, which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you. • Because of the capsule's mode of action, compliance with recommended fat intake is crucial.</seg>
<seg id="2601">If you take the same amount of fat as before, this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat.</seg>
<seg id="2602">By adhering to the recommended intake of fat, you can maximize your weight and at the same time reduce the likelihood of diet-related accompanying symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="2603">34 This reduced calorie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing frustrations and disappointments.</seg>
<seg id="2604">The more active you are, the higher your recommended calorie intake. • "Low physical activity" means that you daily burn only little or even do not go up stairs, work in the garden or perform other physical activities. • "Medium physical activity" means that you can burn 150 kcal each day, e.g. through 3 km walk, 30 to 45 minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2605">• For a lasting weight loss, it is necessary to set up realistic calorie and fat targets and to keep them. • Meaning is a nutritional diary with information about the calorie and fat content of your meals. • Try to move more before you start taking alli.</seg>
<seg id="2606">The alli program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to nourish calorie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become more active.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alois is used in chemotherapies which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as chemotherapies, which are moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The effectiveness of Alois can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a drug that can be used as an anti-emetic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended, as there are not enough information about the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), which prevents receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong and moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong triggers for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours following chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours following chemotherapy (153 from 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 from 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company Helsinn Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alois is indicated: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately-etogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be amplified by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">As palonosetron can prolong the colon assay, patients with anamnestible obstipation or signs of a subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous dispensing of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is extended or which tend to be such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapeutic administration, Alois is expected to be used neither for prevention nor treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents studied (Cisplatin, Cyclophosphamide, Cycloabin, Doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (amethasone and rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (amiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, ritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the Clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience in the application of palonosetron in human pregnancies does not occur, therefore palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common adverse events were observed at a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which might at least be related to alopia, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the delivery (burning, hardening, complaints and pain) were reported in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage, similar occurrences of undesirable events, such as in the other dosage groups, were not observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, but due to the large distribution volume, a dialysis is probably not effective in treating an aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients who received a moderately-etogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and 250 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide (half-life time 7.3 hours) were given intravenously at day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosetron were compared with patients receiving 32 mg of ondansetron receiving intravenously at day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderate emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly-etogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of Ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical studies, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular degeneration and repolarization and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted in 221 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the ECG-effects of an IV palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV injection follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale semicircle of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (CMAx) and the area below the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally in the entire dose range of 0,390 μ of g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dosisproportionately.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration in 11 testicular cancer patients was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), the value measured after one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg was comparable; however, the CMAx was higher after the one-time dosage of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and approximately 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor compared to palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies of metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an IV single dose of 10 micrograms per kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unaltered active substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">The total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal Clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min after a one-time intravenous bolt injection.</seg>
<seg id="2644">While in patients with severe liver dysfunction, terminale elimination of elimination and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, however, a reduction in the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, indicating a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies, evidence suggests that palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular degeneration and reolarisation and can prolong the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of Palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans) which were given daily over two years resulted in an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and as aloxi is determined by humans for one-time use, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) passed a negative opinion, in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A which is already approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicines" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic examination the liver tissue has damage, moreover, the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are increased in the blood-norm.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced which stimulates it to form the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that show the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the effectiveness of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 out of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after receiving treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided provided the EMEA is acknowledged</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed will not be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alphane, the disease increased again in more patients than with the reference medicaments; in addition, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug constitutes an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected laths (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or probably caused by methicillinTamiflu-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because it may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but for patients less than 18 years, the area to be treated may not be more than 2% of the body surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients among placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together in case of skin wounds, approximately 90% of the patients of both groups responded to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that in the treatment of abscesses (stained cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused or probably caused by MRSA, it is not effective enough.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo were outweigh the risks associated with short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, infected small infirmities, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission granted approval to Glaxo Group Ltd. for the transport of altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined once more and an alternative therapy should be considered (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or severe local irritation due to the use of retapamulin ointment the treatment is canceled, the ointment is carefully wiped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections with which MRSA is known as pathogen or suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials with secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of retapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3-day treatment no improvement or worsening of the infected area occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected to be expected in vivo (see Section 5.2) due to the low plasma concentrations observed in humans after topical application on skinned skin or infected superficial wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg ketoconazole the mean Retapamines AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment rose by 81% after topical application of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not required if topical Retapamulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity according to oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and foetus / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be used during pregnancy when topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Deciding whether breast feeding should be continued / stopped or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / stopped is to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical trials involving 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have used altargo, the most common reported side effect was irritation at the administration of the administration which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of retapamulin is due to the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s unit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting anti-bacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransferase Centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, pleuromutiline inhibits the peptide transfer, partly block P-binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50s-bosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">Should the local prevalence of resistance apply to the use of retapamulin at least some types of infection, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin opposite S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-contact to the treatment at S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = panton-valentine leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retapamulin ointment was applied daily by occlusion to intact and scraped skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of infected traumatic wounds, single plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">The sampling was carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before medication and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion on humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 skunk of skin (CMAx = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) was 660 times lower than the retinol IC50 for the PGP inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microphones was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity in rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro-review on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes as well as in the rat micronucleus for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were no signs of limited fertility in male nor female rats at oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which was achieved up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 skunk):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, oral doses of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced weight of the fetus and delayed Ossification) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of approval for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in Module 1 8.1 of the approval application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the marketing authorisation agreement is required to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmacovigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP) and in module 1.8.2 of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP that are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use," the updated RMP will be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Cause irritation or other signs and symptoms in the treated area, you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not specifically prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, mouth or lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">When the ointment is on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a Gazette strap unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years old who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization, and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be carried out.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or other Hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines work by" "" "teach" "" "the immune system (the natural defence of the body), as it can fight against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same components as the since 1996 approved vaccine Twinmatrix adults and the since 1997 approved vaccine Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, Twinrix adults and TwinCArix children are given a vaccination plan existing from three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinmatrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinhead adults are also used as proof for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration for a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study with 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix initiated a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B, between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar in a six month and a 12 month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue, and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other ingredients or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals a permit to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization schedule for primers with Ambirix is made up of two doses, with the first dose being given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered after the first dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a chimney shrinkage is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent persons who have responded to hepatitis C vaccination require a refrescoction as protection, as they may also be protected by immunological memory in case of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As for all injection-vaccines, appropriate options for medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and those with disorders of the immune system, there may be no sufficient anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody, so that additional doses of vaccines can be required in these cases.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal insufficiency in the gluteal muscles, these injection paths should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambirix can be injected subcutanally as an exception, as in these cases, bleeding can occur after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When ambient psychrix in the second year of life was given in the form of a separate injection, tetanus, acellular Pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with a combined mass-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects, it is assumed that there may be no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical trial, which was conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maternity, gastroenteritis, headache and fever was similar to the frequency observed in earlier thiomal and preservative formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years, Ambirix's tolerance was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and consistency on a calculation basis per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the gift of Ambirix in 50.7% of the subjects, compared with 39.1% in subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle 66.4% of the subjects who had been given the ambix reported pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of matininess was comparable to per proband (i.e. over the whole vaccine cycle at 39.6% of subjects who received Ambirix) compared to 36.2% in subjects who received the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and matininess was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-doses vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccines, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the atmosphere group was similar to that observed when administered with the 3-tins combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11- year-old age, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-doses vaccination scheme with the combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years, the seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6-administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second, month 6-administered dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted in 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combinant vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotectrates (SP in table below) were significantly higher compared to Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 following the administration of the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 to 11-year-old one month after the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-doses vaccination scheme with a combination-vaccine with 360 ELISA-units of formalininactivated hepatitis-A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunoreaction against both antigens in this study was comparable to those found after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine comprising of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatitis- A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies can be shown 24 months after immunization in the 0-6- month vaccination scheme compared to that in the 0-12 months vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was given at the same time as a combination of a combined diphtheria-, tetanus, acellular Pertussis- and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (DTPA-IPV / HIB) or with the first dose of a combined mass-mumps-rubella vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2771">A clinical study, which was conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults, showed similar serum and seroconversion rates similar to previous formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2772">The vaccine is to be examined both before and after the resuspation of any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes.</seg>

<seg id="2784">• If you want rapid protection against hepatitis B (i.e. within 6 months and before the usual administration of the second inoculation dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child of vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined Hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination (360 ELISA units of a formalinactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant Hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inoculation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix will be injected under the skin and not into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood clots. • If you / your child is weakened due to illness or treatment in your / her body's defense, or if you / your child undergo a hemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be adequate so that a blood test can be required to see how strong the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Say to your doctor if you / your child occupy other medicines (including those you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / or has been given / or has been planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">It may be, however, that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person therefore is not protected against one or both Hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine must be given at the same time, it should be vaccinated in separate areas and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually Ambirix pregnant or breastfeeding women will not be given, unless it is urgently needed that they can be vaccinated against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information about certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic) in your child.</seg>

<seg id="2799">Other side effects that have been reported for days or weeks following vaccination with comparable combination or single vaccines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare (less than 1 fall per 10,000 blended doses) are reported:</seg>
<seg id="2800">These include spatially limited or extended amplitudes that may itch or vesicle, swelling of the eye area and the face, scary breathing or swallowing, sudden drop of blood pressure and unconsciousness.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have been known since the initial approval of the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, as Ambirix was placed in traffic only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonaps can also be used in patients at the age of more than a month with intrinsic enzyme defect or with hyperammonium encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonium is - split into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastropostomy (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nose tube (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since Ammonaps could not be compared to another treatment or placebo (a placebo).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammonaps can also cause loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disturbances or taste sadiversion, stomach pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that Ammonaps in patients with disorders of the urea cycle have effectively prevented high ammonia values.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonaps was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because of the rarity of the disease at the time of approval, limited information about this medicine occurred." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a delayed form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), there is an indication for use when there is a hyperammonia encephalopathy in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granulate form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for growth and the development of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">For patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine scarring, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine arginine synthetase deficiency must obtain arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be administered to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe kidney failure, as well as in combination with sodium retention and edema.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolisation and excretion of sodium phenylbutyate is done over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The significance of these results in pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In the subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), a slowdown of neuronal proliferation was slowed down and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functional nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in the breast milk in humans, and for this reason, the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least 56% of patients had at least one unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 10), frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, pamytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">An overdose case occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms go hand in hand with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolically active compound which is conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is similar to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogenous atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients suffering from disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of recorded sodium phenylbutyate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylsaline.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is diagnosed early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prediction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infectious, and the disease itself led to death in treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">Due to hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen discharge (sodium phenylbutyate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn at postpartum (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonium encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even with these patients it came with time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a delayed form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the ornithine-scarpathy-defect), which recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and were subsequently treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further worsening of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylacetate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymatic with glutamine. phenylacetylglutamine is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis, as well as repeated endings of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were determined 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary cyclic disorders or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyate (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) was no phenylacetate in the plasma after nightly fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the mean phenylacetate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher in the plasma level than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The drug is excreted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">After the Micronucleus test results, sodium phenylbutyate had no complained effects in toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either orally taken (infants and children who cannot swallow tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or have given a gastropostomy or a nose tube.</seg>
<seg id="2851">The normal daily dose sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day for children with a body weight of more than 20 kg and adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">For patients suffering from an early manifest deficiency of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornithine scarring, the substitution of citrulline or arginine is required in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), lesions were found in the pyramids of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A likely toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy associated with lactic acidosis, severe hypokalemia, pamytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is similar to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogenous atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for excretion of excess fat</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed, that sodium phenylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylacetylglutamine can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further worsening of neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g. of sodium phenylbutyate in granular form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyate were determined 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the period of durability, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">This procedure contains the small measuring spoon of 0,95 g, the average measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to obtain the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS may also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate after consuming proteins in the body.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, because sodium phenylbutyate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2866">When taking AMMONAPS with other medicines, please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you take other medicines or have recently taken, even if it is not prescription drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2867">During breastfeeding, you should not take AMMONAPS, as the medicine may pass into breast milk and damage your baby.</seg>
<seg id="2868">In rare cases confusion, headaches, taste disturbances, posturing of hearing, disorientation, memory disorders and a worsening of existing neurological conditions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2869">If you encounter any of these symptoms, feel free to contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiating an appropriate treatment.</seg>

<seg id="2878">31 • Take a heaped measuring spoon of granulate from the tank. • Fill a straight edge, e.g. a knife back over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess granulate. • The amount remaining in the measuring scoop is equivalent to a measuring spoon.</seg>
<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary syndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different strength) or myocardial infarction (abnormal measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is given and infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angioxin was compared with a glycoprotein-IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug to prevent blood clots) with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, the patient was often a stent (a short tube that remains in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as rituximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or vascularisation) after 30 days or a year as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bialirudin, other hirudine or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with strong high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd for the transfer of angiograms in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI) in an emergency intervention or if early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous bolus of 0.1 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a patient is PCI in another row, an additional capita of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion is increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be absorbed for 4 to 12 hours after the clinical necessity.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Prior to the procedure, a bolus can be administered of 0.5 mg / kg, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angioxime in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent IV infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of an alluring Bolus-Gift of Angiox was not examined and is not recommended even if a short PCI-intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to below 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drug should be carefully mixed prior to application and the bolt dose should be quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether treated with bialirudin versus ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 second, a second captive dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt has to be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes following the administration of the bivalirudin-bolt without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and patients with dialysis, Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angioxin may be initiated 30 minutes after termination of intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• unknown hypersensitivity to the active substance or other ingredients or against Hirudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a disturbance of the hemostatic system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • serious kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and for patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients must be carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when it is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see Section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most of the haemorrhages on arterial puncture points occur in PCI patients, patients who undergo a percutaneous basonarintervention (PCI) may occur during the treatment in principle throughout hemorrhages.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and being treated with bidvalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after dropping treatment with bivalirudin is once again reaching the level existing prior to treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombocyte aggregationshemmer) it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological checkmatic parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The animal experiments are inadequate with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth, or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to Bivalirudin plus GPIb / IIIa Inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfactional heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, there were more undesirable events in women and patients over the age of 65 compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings have been defined in accordance with ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleedings such as in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and severe bleedings were significantly less common among Bivalirudin than in groups with heparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIb / IIIa- Inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY serious hemorrhage was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the punctured area, reduction of haemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed hemorrcalisations occurred, which occurred in more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" point positions, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects are based on the data from a clinical trial of Bivalirudin in 6000 patients who are PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, there were more undesirable events in women and patients over the age of 65 compared to male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly lower than in the comparison group under heparin plus GPIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive application and are grouped according to system organ classes in Table 6.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of overdosing, the treatment with bivalve should be stopped immediately and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angioxin contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as in the anion-detection region of Thrombin, irrespective of whether thrombosis is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of bivalirudin to thromboin, and thus its effect, is reversible because thromboin on its part slowly cleaves the binding of bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, which regenerates the function of the active centre of thromboin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, Bivalirudin with serum from patients in the past had come to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin-induced thrombocytopenia / heparin induced thrombal syndrome (HIT / HITTS).</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and patients, bivalirudin shows a dose-based and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is proven by prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was followed by a PCI, an additional capita of 0.5mg / kg of bialirudin should be given and the infusion was increased to 1.75mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was given in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years onwards with diabetes that require insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin cellisine differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter duration than a short acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In type 2 diabetes, where insulin is unable to work effectively, Apidra has been studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with type 1 diabetes in adults, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin claw.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to islanisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adjusted when administered together with a number of other drugs that may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to acquire Apidra in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall, thigh or deltoid or by continuous infusion in the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced glucose availability and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of force, brand (herd), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or termination of treatment, particularly in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The change of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be subject to strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore change when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar reduction and increase the tendency towards hypoglycemias include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE) inhibitors, discopyons, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylate and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or missing under the effect of sympathic polytics such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethiine and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin with regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin cellisine enters human breast milk, but generally insulin does not enter breast milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the unwanted pharmacies known from clinical trials, grouped by system organ classes and ordered by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very frequent: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, concentration problems, lightheadedness, excessive hun- ger, changes in vision, headaches, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Wird fails to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemias with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After a gluctal injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (especially due to skeletal muscles and fat) and by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in cutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration of the active insulin is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study with 18 male subjects at the age of 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin therapy in the therapeutic relevant dosage range from 0,075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose proportional to the dose proportional to glucosesenkende effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisine has twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosesenkende effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data, a similar post-prandiale glycaemic control is reached in an application of islanisin 2 minutes before the meal, as given with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If islanisine was cooked 2 minutes before the meal, a better postlusive control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If islanisin is turned 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycaemic control like in human normal insulin, which is given 2 Mi- nuten before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-lulisin at gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal was given before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Islanisine at gift 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
