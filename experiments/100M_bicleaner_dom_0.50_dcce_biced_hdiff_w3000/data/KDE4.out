the package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making these easier available .
more information on how to use &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select Settings Exten@@ sions .... Open the card map tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard settings from the k@@ de package ; add@@ ons . please note that if you have additional software installed on your system , you may need more modules .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains , before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Extras Dis@@ cover . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if available .
the View filter module ( also called folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Noti@@ fication Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root tip of the document , for example : document@@ ary element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root @-@ node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different tool@@ bar and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to graphi@@ cally represent ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is propor@@ tionally to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size of a folder shows the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far below the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap Pres@@ entation is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view mode , can either be depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough room for representation or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles may occur . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
in case of display algorithms for Tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always respected . it is drawn frame to make the ne@@ sted entries are no longer available . note that less space for the frame is lost if the rect@@ angle is quad@@ r@@ atic .
how spl@@ itting the surface of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is done is left to the implementation . in this context , it is always advantageous for lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles arise which are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can set the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry over the menu item view view at area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
you can find the module picture gallery in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .
when you visit the module picture gallery , a dialog opens , with which you can set the image of the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tit@@ le &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option allows you to edit the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option Image per line has a slider and a rotation field to set the number of mini@@ atures of each line in the gallery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ap@@ pointed Name of the Image &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box , you can specify whether the file names are shown in the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
display the image size of the image to see if the file size is shown below the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you can indicate whether the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the Fol@@ der Fol@@ der , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the Save In HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
to include the sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider or a turning field , until what level the sub@@ folders are included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; copy the original images to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; box to copy the original images to the gallery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to use the comment field comment file , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the mini thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation area can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; View menu under the navigation pane or with the button F@@ 9 .
to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or &apos;s navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback .
change browser identi@@ fier adds a menu entry in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser identi@@ fier of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser identi@@ fier into one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to call up with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W@@ 3@@ C standard or use your own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this out@@ dated browser .
with this option , the default browser identi@@ fier is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of information on the used browser and operating system in the individual .

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; editing ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE image plug @-@ in interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; digi@@ kam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as the camera or the lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and opportunities for improvement .
if you are in the program , the Help menu contains one entry problems or requests reports .... This opens up a dialog with an under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . all required information is already registered here . just follow the instructions to send your report .
digi@@ code ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; visit the website to find news about released versions and other information about &amp; editing .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate , is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you are editing &amp; editing ; for the first time , you &apos;ll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your machine . here , the data retrieve is saved . this path stays the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ code ; will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek .
if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ code ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed .
you can &apos;t exclude sub @-@ folders unless there &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folders . this allows you to insert an extra layer before the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos than symbols . you can change the albums by using any picture from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can go in &amp; digi@@ code ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw data support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , editing &amp; editing may also work . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ 2 and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; editing ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader , supported by your operating system , will work with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device . the connection can also be realised using the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
Photo@@ 2 is a free , exten@@ sible software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete .
the ex@@ if support is required by some lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera operators to read the preview images . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ in Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ vi@@ mg and g@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way how it can be a user . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; editing came ; even carry out .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the al@@ ve , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or into another application window . the only limitation is that you can &apos;t put an image in keywords , date list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view right now . so , the filter will work on the file name only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ settings dialog .
the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard drive , or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the picture is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right @-@ click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection created by you will be used to sort your photos when you want to add or delete collections from the collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the settings for collections .
the Album Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums sorted by date .
the buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date to the oldest , the newest picture or the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder .
when you first select an album in &amp; editing , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album symbol , you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ preview win@@ en@@ quot ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
album collections have a different effect . the collection includes all the photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two lou@@ vers in the tool@@ bar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated . you can avoid this by using all preview images in the Tools menu .
information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information this is , you can change settings editing ; set up . select the albums page and adjust the preview pane to suit your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse cur@@ sor rest for a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all key features of a photo . the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos are all that is available at &amp; digi@@ kam . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you . the image editing shows your photos and allows you to get a number of improvements to this . you can easily view all the functions with &amp; editing ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the pictures .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Picture Edit ... or selecting the right mouse button and editing ... . in the editing pane , you will find a manual on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view and change your photos .
it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by clicking the right mouse button and selecting the program from the menu of opening . to do this , and how to adapt it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing by other image editing programs , problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur . some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc .
the easiest is to select it with the right mouse button on the preview and select Rot@@ ate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you want to delete a photo from &amp; digi@@ kam , it will be moved to the bin of &amp; k@@ de ; move . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del In case you want to actually really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
&amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ Li@@ ste@@ quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ code ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if it is not available , the date of the last change of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all the photos selected with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . by this you can lo@@ gically organize your keywords . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My sampling quot ; or on an existing keyword . if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will become the sub@@ stit@@ ch of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword . a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ;
to select another photo as an album symbol , select the picture with the right mouse button and select As Alb@@ um@@ preview in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want with a keyword , you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword quot ; drag and drop them . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the preview of the pictures and select keyword references from the context menu .
you can select a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you assign one of the keywords to it assigned keywords . in this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event in which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image .
you can remove a keyword in which you can right @-@ click the context menu of the photo and select from the key menu Rem@@ ove . the menu only displays the key words assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a tim@@ eline @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you only have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame which indicates the time unit .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this appears in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and in the future even more .
if you click here , the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp is red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you entered as a search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search is done . the results will be displayed in the view My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only have to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit your search form , the search will appear again with the previously entered search information . if you select As Exten@@ ded Search , the dialog for the advanced search will appear to change your previous search . here you will find more rules for searching .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the Search context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ code ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . one option can be added to this list with search group / Search group can be deleted or deleted from it . each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ...
&amp; digi@@ kam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows you to compare images by comparing these signatures . the lower the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar items : this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ erts , the results can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from anywhere on the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free @-@ hand color sketch : draw a fast sketch and dig@@ its ; find the matching images . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can drag the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your Ge@@ o filter , which will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L To add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lamp table and its window opened .
from the preview panel you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right of the window and place it there . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window pane is to be seen .
another mode is better suited to quickly fade out of a picture series . if you navigate from the tool@@ bar , the first two images will automatically be loaded into the fields to compare . the right @-@ hand side image is displayed in the right area . this makes it easy to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file Edit ....
all picture information from the right side@@ bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the back@@ light . for example , this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section , you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; hold down in mode preview then both images will show the same image area .
zoom in the same way as in other views . just use the zoom controller under the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images when you are in the Pre@@ view mode .
digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos receives , scans or digit@@ ally stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos . we focus on the methods for digital photographer editing &amp; editing ; we view the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , group , save , optimize , wait and export image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , in accordance with your definition , data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
I venture to asser@@ t if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no longer find a particular photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you definitely do not use &amp; editing ; . the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether to have access to your photos , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc . be sure that you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point .
holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes batch processing easier . separate new ones from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend saving the metadata option in the editing page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ code ; this ensures that EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the File menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what ? to do so , editing &amp; editing a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , since you should now assign keywords , labels and an evaluation to each photo . of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value .
now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you bz@@ w the pictures to the right place . changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another .
the graphic shows how different metadata is overl@@ apped . this is a very coarse representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar dates are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you want to share your photos with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive .
take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I say to you this the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you begin to dream , to have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely .
for others looking at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ kam , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as let@@ tering . K@@ DE even provides you a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels are exported to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now driving with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will still be deep@@ ening in the future . I am sure one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips with geographic data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and design@@ ates the practice the copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all modified versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information came from the editing page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the photographer &apos;s name , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used .
this field contains the photographer &apos;s work name . examples of this can be titles such as : employee Phot@@ ograph@@ er , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
editor ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this image embedded in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique in each image . digi@@ code ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we are dealing with problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
in order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , you must not trust them for more than a few years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you just have been written . therefore , they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to perform miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are similar applications that read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device to high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ ex@@ propri@@ ated format . then read the data again with a description , date &amp; author and then store on a clean , dark dry and protected site . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media .
flo@@ ppy manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers warranty covers a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the troubleshooting mechanisms of hard drives : disk error study
in brief : dis@@ ks hold the longest when operating in the Temper@@ ature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperature tures , the fault rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of errors , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices don &apos;t matter much , the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause scrat@@ ched key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is a surge protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in strip .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used on your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as there is also a telephone connection for your modem . others offer over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for on the go .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in an un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the ability to store your data and re@@ arrange the system . some models also allow them to continue working until the current runs . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its safety in power failure with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over @-@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 euros . this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected by this .
the Amazon Web @-@ Service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can include it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
however , compared to the hard drives at home , they are very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollar ; 500 . moreover , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are refer@@ enced to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution Online .
from the point of view of the data backup , the web solutions are very secure . thanks to the TCP protocol , transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory . thus , they are deser@@ v@@ ant .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs file system provides at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
the worst part is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred , not if this happened in your hardware . all these interrup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet using its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not affected by transmission problems right now , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leop@@ ard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English .
Oracle has launched an own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it causes less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden inter@@ ruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings away from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural boundary for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anyone else responsible for data loss . so , keep your data on a plan every year and test this backup before you make anything hazardous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash strikes you lucky if the drive wasn &apos;t connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually concern an entire room or the complete house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , to the neigh@@ b@@ oured house , to your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it generates several sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup was made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
back up important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
this procedure gives you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come up for the backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further di@@ lution should be done manually after you have made a complete review .
topics : metadata , stored IP@@ TC data stored in the image file , associate X@@ MP files , original storage , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual devices , ... , use of the Internet .
so precious pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate as time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . the fewer variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should review your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist pressure for the ability to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and you want to expand the range that you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition . at * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
check with the d@@ mes@@ g command to see if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted reside / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted reside / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of rei@@ ser@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task is easier from year to year .
GI@@ F is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you shouldn &apos;t use it anymore .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GI@@ F . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF is widely used as an image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages high @-@ quality images , but requires very large files .
D@@ NG has been developed based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers have already made D@@ NG available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a coding technology that allows users to em@@ bed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive your recording , mostly in raw format , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP does this because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include architecture and modeling , discussions , and community work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images on the camera edi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not implemented yet .
for a fine editing , you can use external programs . if you re @-@ edit the images with &amp; digi@@ code , then you should add the metadata again , which may be trun@@ cated from the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only then export them to web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; editing ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your al@@ b database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , connect these to the computer , switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on . another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera .
when the connection is made , a fer@@ ent indicator appears at the bottom and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the page trim features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Met@@ adata dialog displays internal metadata such as ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the Met@@ adata page strip from the main window of &amp; editing ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . while downloading , the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button Download and then download selected . the button Sel@@ ected is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New downlo@@ ad@@ able . these images have not been downloaded from &amp; edited until now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded .
if you are using the All Download or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the section My Albums . then select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after you have selected the target album , press OK , and digi@@ code ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all at once , using the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete some , you have to select it first and then delete the selected deleted .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . you should check carefully if the photos were successfully downloaded in a &amp; digi@@ code ; they should be checked carefully before you delete them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera bug completely , you should do so by using the camera menu , because this is much faster .
cameras often do not use meaningful names for the photos . the file names are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames in case you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section , you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for date @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the ex@@ if information are copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
if you want a different date format than the standard format , e.g. in the editing field , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y % H % H : % M : % S . turn on the Date &amp; Time option . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you use the option Camera fil@@ en@@ ame , you can change the file name in lo@@ wer@@ case letters when downloading . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ code ; the photo in original orientation . if you want to turn off automatic rotation , use the Advanced tab and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken , &amp; digi@@ kam ; this use to automatically create sub@@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album .
this option is usually switched off , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based sub@@ mit@@ es option at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the selection is completed , ask &amp; digi@@ code ; see where the images are to be uploaded . select the folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in long@@ itude and lati@@ tude and can be displayed on a map . determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data .
if you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser which shows the area with a click . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ code ; users wishing to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how do the GPS data enter the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . right with the right hardware , via post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical allocation ( manual ) and last about manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transferring data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can do the same on &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the lati@@ tude and lati@@ tude , or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ zy coordinates , which are created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all navigation details for Europe .
the editing dialog is divided into eight pages . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left side .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or edit image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; determine if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface .
this field should be used as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a more detailed description of the car field , it must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the name that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be entered here since they offer the picture to other &amp; quot ; . if the picture is a bearing photograph , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC @-@ actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only available in the &amp; digi@@ code database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in &amp; edited ; imported without being lost .
save image tags as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; Dig@@ it ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button to the right of each category .
the option &amp; quot ; If you then open the beam , these settings are not available . the option &amp; quot ; you should use only on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can switch off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this viewing mode with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 can be switched on and off .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are en@@ coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more details .
using p@@ ng compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG uses a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression ratio .
you can use the TI@@ FF file option to comp@@ ress the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality since the de@@ late algorithm works los@@ s@@ free .
with los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save los@@ s@@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; editing , the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog , you can change the settings of the image processing .
if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option draws the image slightly soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the Automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is based on a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed pictures in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras , this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed lights , so the parts of your images that are burned down , due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights , as a continuous white view . the setting colors release creates some unusual results as they display the pointed lights in various rose tones . finally , you can try to construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question how much color or white you want .
if you select the re@@ construct option , you will get the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be adapted for each image individually .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . to keep the time for the demo@@ s icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete image from the part raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix colored pixel . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color reconstruction .
as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ esis @-@ Direc@@ ted ) produces the quality for me and the paper I used . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . it produces color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you are familiar with the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ ding correction , as it is done during the shell conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions on how to restore them . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a color space in the others are to be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start .
color Profile Fol@@ der Please attach the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC in which you store all your profiles .
settings of the ICC profiles you have here the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed when the raw file is opened .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like Canon , which do not contain any color ton@@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to do the color mapping yourself .
there are other options such as the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print an image , because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can act very saturated .
for most cameras , it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for . unfortunately , not for Canon models . so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together .
the Canon profile exten@@ tion lets you see the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a range of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and these will then be loaded by &amp; digi@@ kam . these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can set short commands in the Settings menu .
more information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the controls of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adju@@ sts the time between the transitions , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display .
on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection that tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the image display mode .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera box .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ code ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn it on .
check , if &amp; digi@@ code ; the camera detects automatically . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera .
you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can paste it all here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the tr@@ ash stores , you can display the conversation between &amp; editing ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album , you will find further details .
the editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly handled by &amp; digi@@ kam ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without re@@ viewing . otherwise , you will need to apply changes to the button changes .
you can also display &amp; digi@@ code welcome screen ; stop when starting . this speeds up the editing &amp; editing process under certain circumstances .
when something was deleted from the base folder , search &amp; digi@@ kam ; you know if it is to delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited ; you can select the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings from the tool@@ bar under Settings . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in plain text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; editing , you will find further information about this in this tutorial .
you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button to preview an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the entry ad / edit entry .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of these are available as modules in &amp; editing ; so you may not be part of your distribution .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current fil@@ en@@ ame , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save or button Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image .
you should possibly create a copy of your image before changing it . this can be done with file save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu from the File menu or using the Rest@@ oring button again in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have taken on the photo since the last saving .
almost every action of the image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . you can undo the last action by modi@@ fying undo or restoring it by selecting Edit Ret@@ ain@@ ing from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z for undo and remember C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the return or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter the photo and zoom out where you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically
view Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , the tool@@ bar is displayed . if you do not want this , you can change it in the editing dialog .
if you want to print the current image , you can select File Print in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select print assistant from the Album Ex@@ ports menu . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice .
the main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same page strip is available without the navigation arrows , also in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple clicks on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the labels will then be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this , you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the review section shows a rating schema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select them and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field of Ur@@ gency . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
the sample view shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a box with the keywords previously used in this &amp; digi@@ code session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can limit the number of options in search of a keyword fast . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , they will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . keywords of an image are keyword in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the section Key@@ word Fil@@ ters .
the page strip stit@@ ch filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more stu@@ b filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also draw and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply pull it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears which asks you whether you want to set the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on one calendar day . the keyword filter is set to No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was selected and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled under Settings Mis@@ cellaneous .
if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or two , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , key word , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , specify an advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly edited it and adapted it to specific implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that your camera or scanner are using have a predictable devi@@ ation from the actual photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark chamber .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point in the image processing work@@ flows . additionally , links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture editions are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to think about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to k@@ alli@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to k@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor , as s@@ RGB then runs the circle . if you work as a color space of s@@ RGB , you either need to k@@ alli@@ br@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can enhance a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual editing .
the functions norm@@ alize , compare , Automatic merge and contrast extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Automatic correction try to automatically make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the wavel@@ eng@@ ths over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ ghtest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out .
balancing : this method adju@@ sts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity canal gets as flat as possible . sometimes the same produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation , which either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic balancing : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it identifies the dark and bright border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram segment .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the largest possible area and a re@@ orientation of all values in between . this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space is worked with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you are too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target photo has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
at the top right there is a hist@@ ogram showing that dynamic changes as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels are very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . shadow alignment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos .
to play with the controls above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature selected for calcul@@ ating the colour temperature of the white balance . this way the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the Pre@@ ferences list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator raises the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will see the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons do exactly this . any setting of the white balance you have set allows you to store it in a text file and load it later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Pre@@ ferences knob re@@ stores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is available only for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool will open the same dialog as the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be done through the under@@ window for the brightness . detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter on color management .
another important tool is to find color correction in the menu . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to store multiple color channels . this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation , that you can find in color gra@@ dation in the menu .
the color effects are available for four colour effects , a solar energy effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a filter filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when using a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completing the development of the image . this had the effect that the bri@@ ghter areas were darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination .
the intensity controls the solar system . at approx . 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar energy effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation because it has a stronger contrast @-@ effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . simply try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos .
Vel@@ via &apos;s name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to correct the color contrast and the intensity of the photos . you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too great satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mold Gra@@ dation and the Simp@@ le Leu@@ ch@@ thickness / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool t@@ onal correction is located to improve exposure . even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated , you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here . more specific the three slides below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three slides are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn is to move the knob and take care of how the picture changes .
the original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right . the preview is dynamic , updated based on the settings of the image . the following options are available on the left @-@ hand side .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted , whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top one for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds , often called g@@ amma values .
the three colour pin@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows , middle and bright tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
exit values : the output values allow selecting manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output rate inter@@ actively as in the input rate . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . for this purpose , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input is automatically read@@ ju@@ sted for all shadows , means and sun shades . select the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the entry of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposed Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to see over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful . for images with large areas of a constant color , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright tones , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker .
on the preview of the original photos a red marker is visible . if you shift this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line appears on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p cor@@ n@@ ering format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun shades . turn on the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposed Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if detected in more than one channel , you will see the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the lumin@@ ance canal . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the editing &amp; editing channel bl@@ ender ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the can@@ als by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left part of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison over one &apos;s rider .
the target image preview has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you enable lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mono @-@ rom , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the far@@ th@@ est . far@@ ci@@ ons consist of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the colour space first .
the save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposed Indi@@ c@@ ator option controls all color channels to see over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited picture below ( 2 ) to be seen .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step as color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green l@@ enti@@ l filter . this looks good with all scene pictures and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky . so similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange filters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange l@@ enti@@ l filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow l@@ enti@@ l filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
se@@ pi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the sh@@ ading floors . this is very similar to the process of le@@ aking a pressure and re @-@ development in a se@@ pi@@ ate oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; dig@@ ging tool ; apply tool texture to apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the picture .
the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) to be seen . the relief parameter has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; editing came ; adding tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . one way of keeping his attention is to put the picture into a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . the picture with a colored line surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , be@@ v@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . ideal for a kno@@ ck effect and decorative adding an ornamental frame with patterns .
width : speci@@ fies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ lowing the aspect ratio before .
with this convenient tool , you can insert simple a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this also goes in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . just enter the text and place it with the mouse . you will need to adjust the font size of the image size and the character set with its properties as you need .
any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore .
with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; tool template you can apply a template about a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you need to use the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button of the base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . the selection of a folder updates the preview tool@@ bar automatically .
there are three buttons under the preview with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
smaller : this button shr@@ inks the image below . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ code ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but creates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blu@@ r mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric mist and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ ri@@ ghted by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting .
images without focus as well as most digit@@ alized images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is due to the fact that the digi@@ tization process has to combine colors with minimal differences to one color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more after@@ ward sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , internal sharpen@@ ing is often applied . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some sc@@ anners are already using a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharp@@ ness index . this can be done with the menu entry Con@@ duct Scor@@ ing .
however , you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but rein@@ forces the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen one image the tool re@@ focus . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft character with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting V@@ ist@@ ula and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the Filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove sli@@ me from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter using the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or amount intensi@@ fies the effect . if you make the blu@@ r mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates are generated near sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . you should therefore shar@@ pen images best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore plastic errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the fu@@ zzy mas@@ king filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . bl@@ urred mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the editing tool re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ ri@@ ghted design filter algorithm from Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to image an image &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing quot ; in which it is revers@@ ing the photo . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blu@@ r mask . re@@ focusing usually achieves better results than bl@@ urred .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold has a very long tail , which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel , which is far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should yield 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will still further blu@@ r the image .
this is the most commonly caused by a previously executed blu@@ r . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circle @-@ shaped sharp@@ ness or the palate . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the stores as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any more re@@ focusing parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try all cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but leave some unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts later .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , vag@@ initi@@ s masks better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as a focus .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp masks always have to produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never show the effect of bl@@ ur@@ ring . for the Vienna filter , it is possible to show that it is the optimal ruler filter .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the sharp@@ ness correction methods in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the slider &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ lät@@ te &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sets the blu@@ r of the range that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the color tin@@ ting allows an adapted color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones then you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove un@@ desirable art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values are mainly homogen@@ ous regions smooth and detail sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards .
direction Ad@@ diction Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is fl@@ atten@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ining or CCD is a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts are best fixed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . so set this value to match the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : indicates how often the algorithm is passed . usually , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle @-@ width da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , it should also be selected small . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never bigger than 2 .
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal . it doubles the run@@ time . therefore , we recommend it to be om@@ itted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons do exactly this . correct any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
correc@@ ting errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation using the Canc@@ ell@@ ation button at any time .
the module is used on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a unique black arti@@ fact in the background that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip .
noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stains and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; -@@ effects of sc@@ anned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can stay with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blu@@ r the image . the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and thus minor bugs fixed .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or s@@ mi@@ ging occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend changing either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more prone to smoke . however , it also mer@@ ges the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adjustment of phase j@@ itter shock absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations in lumin@@ ance . if it is raised , the edges appear smoo@@ ther if it is too high .
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters of the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to sof@@ ten the soft character with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting V@@ ist@@ ula and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
editing &amp; editing ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : JPEG compression is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it generates some compression &amp; quot ; Artef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons do exactly this . each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and re@@ charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ verage .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera is taken on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo , which was read with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by the scanner &apos;s lighting and the photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ ri@@ ghted by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , t@@ ote or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ trac@@ ting method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly after connecting to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD failures .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels .
the image area and preview help correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all Pix@@ els have a distance from 1 pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is shown below ( 2 ) .
editing &amp; editing ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often uni@@ form@@ ly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aper@@ ture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blu@@ r effects are caused by movement .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and color and grey scale of digital cameras and film sc@@ anners , it is possible to simulate the effect of a c@@ low@@ filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter .
with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three further expos@@ ures to the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree .
leu@@ k@@ strength , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correc@@ tor reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixel . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . you only have positive values available , since you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction on one image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a leu@@ k@@ emia and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool .
editing &amp; editing ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ her@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect , but is fl@@ atten@@ ed at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the distortion of the second degree distortion . with negative values , tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion grid . this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the reverse acci@@ dent@@ als of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus correc@@ ts the first gra@@ ding . negative values increase while positive the image becomes smaller .
bri@@ gh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the preview dialog illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the pitch or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes . best perform this correction as the first . if you want to re@@ cut a picture and then perform a barrel @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correc@@ ting , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal support line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the se@@ abed or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them with the cutting tool in the transform@@ ers menu , cut from image processing or via the Zoom slider to this dialog .
the next logical step for some motives , e.g. photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have a slight distortion of perspective .
this is an example of the t@@ onal correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) to be seen .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of the film and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . if you want to simulate the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller alters the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ ture and the domin@@ ance of green color ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter bl@@ ends color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large sil@@ ver@@ ns of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , stre@@ et@@ photographic , gran@@ ular sight specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
with the controller , the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can use the filter more than once .
this is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; dig@@ its ; Filter Oil Pain@@ ting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; editing came ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and style life are good for this effect .
the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel screen is 1 and smooth 17 .
the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients vary slowly are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you . these would be good pictures to start with .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pen size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the engraving shows your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing about the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape .
depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ver filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the scales 1 , the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Be@@ verage .
with this filter group , you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blu@@ r effects . it uses copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes out the image along star shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the bl@@ ur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image by turning the pixel around a center . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a rotating camera .
ran@@ ge@@ bl@@ r : wi@@ pes the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to appear back in the background .
motion blu@@ r : wi@@ pes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking pictures , camera .
soft sig@@ nage : bl@@ urs the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
sh@@ atter bl@@ ur@@ ring : wi@@ pes the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blu@@ r of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur@@ ring : finds the coloured bas@@ ins in the picture and bl@@ urs them without alter@@ ing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Be@@ verage .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this makes it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n &apos;s copy@@ ri@@ ghted algorithm .
drop@@ let size allows changing the size of drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image .
you can hold with editing ; image processing a range free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ing , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops .
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited p@@ ic ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . you can find the tools in the transform@@ ers menu , transforming or transforming mirrors .
concei@@ ving photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how to re@@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select transforming size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo @-@ blowing was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
retain the aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be maintained when the new size is entered .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more is smoo@@ thed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect it must be set higher than 3 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Save As and Load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ all@@ ot@@ ment for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking a photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ verage .
you can see below an example for photo blowing by enlar@@ ging a small color image on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of Line@@ ar Standard Aug@@ mentation compared .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you need to use the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rect@@ angle , create . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut away . this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is trimmed ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by dra@@ gging the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact .
in the tool After the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the lateral aspect of the width is assigned .
this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimet@@ ers , inches , or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the assembly help make it possible to hide aids so that you can put together your pictures better . these aids are :
harmonious Tri@@ angle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ angels , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonic tri@@ angles aligned on the diag@@ on@@ als .
golden centre : the golden centre is a division that on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaf leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden spl@@ itting is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden spl@@ itting at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number is equal to the sum of its two preceding figures .
the golden centre provides more fluid relief lines when assembling a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your goal to achieve your goal . compared to the third angel , the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze upwards along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow in this way .
another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also deri@@ ve from the gold spir@@ als discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equivalent tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to place these lines can make a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break down your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your picture focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle .
when you make a photo , it happens easily that you do not vertically or horizont@@ ally hold the camera . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose Trans@@ forming Free rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cur@@ sor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in the previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming cro@@ pping from image processing .
an elegant way to crop the image is the Automati@@ cally cutting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image slightly after turning . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . preview will be automatically re@@ charged . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels .
corner left corner : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right below : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is s@@ me@@ ared a little . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you adapted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing .
the sc@@ oring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite . a horizontal pattern , for example , will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left .
rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can shift horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sc@@ aling , the picture gets a bit bl@@ urred . for a single sc@@ aling , this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two ch@@ inc@@ ings produce twice as much bl@@ ur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after sc@@ aling , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to remove them is to cut the image with transforming cro@@ pping from image processing .
the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were compiled . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ kam .
because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , editing &amp; editing is displayed . you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; editing ; accept . in the Con@@ figuration section , you will find more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you to select even the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . this reduces redundant information in order to store the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG with the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ free if this is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , see Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF using the &amp; digi@@ code &apos;s raw image converter .
digi@@ code ; support loading raw images only with the d@@ cra@@ w program , which is available in &amp; digi@@ kam . with this , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave coffee &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw data formats supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ;
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit movies .

if you change steps 4 and 5 , which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustments with the White Balance Module .
many tools you need to edit photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ code ; their description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , soft marks , noise suppression , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ lic@@ quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left part shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper part shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
divide horizont@@ ally . the upper part shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can drag the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it . press C@@ tr@@ l ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to select and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de , can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and Hot User @-@ defined color and last used colors .
in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files .
the cur@@ sor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by cli@@ cked on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette . here , too , the color name can be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m Cur@@ sor is added under the Color button , the color is inserted from the color panel at the cur@@ sor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ writing .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and past@@ ing .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows .
the colors in the palette and the color selection output can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find them in the color pi@@ cker on the left .
graph are used in science , especially in computer science . previously there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; includes , are according to the program author obsol@@ ete &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ ebo@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ m@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ dig@@ its ; the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ se@@ viewer ; displays graph with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ ms@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ron@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from about 1000 knots and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ ron@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required are in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph , each in its own sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ art viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the bottom screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the symbol file open and the ( empty ) list la@@ stly opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( up and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded in &amp; k@@ ron@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph will be rel@@ o@@ aded or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ m@@ viewer ; can also remember your decision , so that later on . if you want to change your decision later , you can set the menu item Settings k@@ ron@@ viewer ; set up ... , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a running &amp; k@@ art viewer ; open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ art viewer ; or want to display the graphs to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but later change it with the setup dialog .
when you start the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical sides can be freely chosen .
if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph coming on one side will be adjusted to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the parts of the graph .
page preview with a row distributed on several pages without header and with a different font
the Renew@@ able Download page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time .
you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window , or in a sub@@ window of the current session ) or specify that every time a graph is asked .
the session management page gives you the ability to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ ron@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which normally appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ M@@ B@@ n ; opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose between different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website are :
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then attempts to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ apping as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ er@@ ased graphs . it produces representations in accordance with the jump spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce spring model for ung@@ od@@ orized graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ str@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold @-@ He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multiple trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm orders the no@@ des circular according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which is then executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and specify the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can change the graph with special options , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
determines the type of graph@@ ene ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for un@@ er@@ ased graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise , it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the mouse poin@@ ter . click on a &amp; GUI element with this mouse poin@@ ter to get further help to this item ( if any ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source repository &apos;s root folder .
&amp; k@@ ron@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program which uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools for displaying . it requires the following program packages :
a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ art viewer ; you will find further options in the Settings menu .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid net in which you draw the symbol .
create a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . then a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to restart from scratch .
re@@ stores the last one . if you haven &apos;t made any progress , this function is de@@ activated .
insert the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scale . this can create colors that do not correspond to those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ;

the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current canvas , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
insert the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three sides templates for icons , background , and tool@@ bars .
with the buttons addition ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove you can modify the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pixels or display a ruler and set a color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparent display . you can also set the size for the ch@@ ess@@ board : the kar@@ os on small , Medium and Large , as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select .
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read new images and save them .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the san@@ e project or another source , such as Video Stre@@ ams . for this to work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the menu entry image scanning a dialog box that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by using the default duc@@ r@@ he option to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before you scan the image with the Scan@@ nen button . the estimated fil@@ esi@@ ze will be displayed in the right , lower corner .
make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not otherwise be displayed .
after you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and hence very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
you can create screen shots after selecting the screen shot in the Im@@ por@@ tieren - &gt; screen shot . a window appears in which you can set the different screen photo modes :
select The Complete Desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have chosen to read The Complete Desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen shot has been made , the dialog box appears with the options described above .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
this module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . likewise , the Auto@@ Play option is available for Windows platforms .
K@@ IP@@ I modules expand the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and other capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world , place the photos of your camera and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the module Ex@@ ports to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you are guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so it is your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can login to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful login , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r website . you will be presented with the following page after a successful login .
just close the browser window and return to the program . after you have cli@@ cked on Yes , you will get the dialog for upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r is started two times , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access rights that the module displays . at present , you will need write per@@ missions . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions .
the button photos should be cli@@ cked once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the key field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the picture as keywords during the upload .
with the Public , Friends and Family options you can set the access rights to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option Change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed before up@@ loading in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image &apos;s metadata . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF s of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ her@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and lati@@ tude are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data , you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to make a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same time in the same locations as the images of your camera .
when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for maximum time devi@@ ation is a top devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . if the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from a place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ating and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button Cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be manually set with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . as the dialog shows the coordinates from one call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Guide this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the map can be switched between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is en@@ coded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the Ri@@ der selection allows you to select all the albums that want to be exported to HTML . the albums are not shown hierarch@@ ically . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the overall look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the picture is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , this also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the Ri@@ der For@@ schau@@ bilder allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations like turning , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the below actions without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size increases because no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found , for example , in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Met@@ adata Editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG En@@ coder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG En@@ coder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic image transition . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of slide au .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can choose a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG En@@ coder . after that , you can create the module via Tools MPEG En@@ ash@@ au .
the images you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high , very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the m@@ peg @-@ output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , this will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the Code . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back .
if a critic appears that co@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages using the settings right below .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gim@@ p image processing . this is e.g. useful to improve or print the Gim@@ p module directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format into one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if camera settings are to be used for white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue enh@@ ancers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG @-@ conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG @-@ switch has no effect .
as soon as you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion outcome . the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later on , you should not choose the JPEG format because there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the EX@@ IF information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . so use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , they have the ability to automatically over@@ write existing files . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or increase the image . for this purpose four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your picture to the screen format .
non Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
print preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be used .
after you have started the module , the image window will be displayed with the pictures you pres@@ elected . add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right .
you can also drag pictures to the list of images and to add them to the list of images to be sent .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only need to add the addresses and the subject here . the images you selected are attached as attachments .
make sure not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments to the images are added to a text file and sent to the email .
the P@@ NG format under the Image file format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG images in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format , the original images will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status messages in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program is started automatically at the end .
after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au module , a window will appear with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually set it down manually with Es@@ c . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the option to select images random@@ ly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album .
the time interval between the images can be set between the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds are 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect .
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly sel@@ ects a different effect at any transition between the images .
during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar on the upper left side of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this tool@@ bar you can pause the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .

the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the desktop .
this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through these browsers , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , there are now entries in each group , in people , places and in the group keyword entries .
in the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images .
if you press the mouse on the entry people , the view of the browser changes . see Fig@@ ure .
if you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons are visible . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images in your area of action .
in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save his own preview image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to display images next to the names , select the button that is located on the right of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display , for example , symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have appropriate images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . in order to do this , you will need to select the image preview window ( as described in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can adjust the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the search in the main window , a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once more .
if you enter a string in the label or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window , you can search all pictures by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here you can see pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the website of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and have a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . after that some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of Photo@@ Album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar displays you data statistics on the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then shows a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed items preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will see only pictures of this time period in the preview view . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a tim@@ eline bar .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as a module ( see ) . in the following section of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described .
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three sections Content , Layout and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each section is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages see an example of these settings .
next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created that is visible on the overview page .
last but not least , you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid the information displayed to the viewer without a description . note that all images are of a party . note that all pictures are exported .
in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
on the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more images that have , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set . so it can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
it is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to select the location for all future pictures . here you can either select a folder or a supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages are created will be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files you have created are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . so that the import function , see , works correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings that are just described have all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time applying the picture information , people on the pictures , location , etc . , then you have to go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not make this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can export a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by means of HTML export .
in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it will be internal or external .@@ k@@ in files . you will have the following three choices :
on the option Manual in the proximity of the .@@ k@@ in file , you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ in file copy &amp; photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is not normally worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export file option .
if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Im@@ porting ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described .
the assistant for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folder the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you person@@ alize the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is named in your database . therefore , in the third dialog window you will be asked which categories of the imported file will be imported and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen in the picture .
it must be easy to browse and look at pictures : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump inside different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , over ( 2 ) browsing and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures , but it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top@@ most folder of its images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , such as Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in the CVS repository .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder in which your pictures are stored and use it in future starts automatically . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Photo / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
through the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; setup ... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of Photo@@ Album ; in the following section of the user manual you will find the various settings options .
to the left , you will see six different symbols that allow you to view the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog that is used to process existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section below , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the dialog Options , you can set up full member groups , i.e. , for example , to set up all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ code and g@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin interface .
the modules can be called via the modules modules . they cannot and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules yourself .
because the modules of multiple applications are used together with each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album have been tested very little . therefore , you should always first test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures &amp; k@@ photo@@ album Demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or through the Help menu .
the applications using the K@@ IP@@ I modules are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : this is an album just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the preview at the moment .
besides the current album , we have to give the modules a list of albums . here is a photo@@ album ; as follows :
when &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the contents of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums . so if you use the category people for example , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start &amp; photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top of the tool@@ bar . at the moment , it does not contain too much information , as you do not have any information about your pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to provide any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you use the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by defining characters , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , since you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : if you have a family celebration , for example , and on all 50 images the same 5 @-@ 10 people are shown , you can , thereby , that the names used are moved up , the persons find and classi@@ fy faster .
if you prefer an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you might want to edit all the selected images and add them with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the pictures before and back , which are located at the top right of the picture .
if you have received multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
on the picture you will see a browser window displaying the USA as an over@@ flow . to show you that it is an over@@ flow , a special icon is displayed .
in the Com@@ ment dialog , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and place it in order to sort it to a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the Com@@ ment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by drawing it outside the window pane .
if you have adapted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options ... which offers you , among other things , the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window .
you can also completely fade out a frame . if you want to see this window again later , use the button Options ... and hide / hide windows here . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or of all images if you have no filter set . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , and just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you haven &apos;t opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete pictures in the preview . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and press either the delete button or select the Edit menu from the Edit menu . now you will see the window you can see in the picture .
you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can have saved the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trun@@ cated are not saved on the hard drive . however , for images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from folders and back into it . so , don &apos;t support it until now to ask for the recording of the CD concerned . so if you want to avoid h@@ ass@@ le about how to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger disk to store all the images .
in the images menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end those remain that you wish to make for others in@@ accessible and click on Current View in the Privacy menu . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister may see , control and lock the menu item everything except current view .
with this you have fixed which images are to be hidden in case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures lock , thereby removing all the images you have locked . if you want to get the pictures displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the Privacy menu .
please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . for one , all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only used to rep@@ el the view of private images .
the reason you want to describe all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ day . for this reason , Photo@@ Album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . of course it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can simply drag it and drop it somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several images to the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the Picture High and Image button . you can jump to the first and last image with tro@@ mb@@ one and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then load a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l key and plus or minus respectively .
a very useful feature of the be@@ holder of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is to be able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the full screen on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer , you can drag and zoom into the image . to zoom in , you can simply pull up a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the Min@@ us button , you can pull out the zoom in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the item key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the key key the zoom puts , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zo@@ om@@ co@@ operations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and Minu@@ key .
you can turn on the picture with the rotation functions from the context menu . this does not work with videos . you can ann@@ ot@@ ate comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
when you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer has the ability to provide images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by clicking on the corresponding letters . in the picture you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have put features on your images , they are available to you in the browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , simply add them all at once with ann@@ ot@@ ations .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview . if you can view categories in the preview view , you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image has been selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you can color photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later .
in order to turn on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , select on the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; work , you must have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire module views .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the sub @-@ object of an already selected object , as all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button can be used to remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click on user or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can view a preview of the property view .
press preview in the tagged view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( e.g. a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ frame view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a visibility step as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their point of view is smaller or equal to the degree of visibility chosen in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window setup , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it as you like . you can also store multiple window orders and simply change between different configurations .
to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the user to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position .
to create a new column , drag the user to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to super@@ impose several views on top of each other , drag the user in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking the map Le@@ ather on top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to save a view from anch@@ oring , drag the an@@ f@@ asser to the desktop or click on the small arrow at the top pointing left arrow in the cham@@ ber@@ ing bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer strip . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views .
you can save the current window view with View window layout . it displays a dialog where you can store the window layout under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to render , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene click on the Ren@@ dering icon The icon Ren@@ dering in the tool@@ bar or select the menu item view scene .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select View Mo@@ di ... the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box below and enter the image section to render into the input fields .
in combination with quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection illumination . a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
when a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , various errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . in general , pictures with this feature look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling incorporates the neighboring pixel . the second method is adaptive , recur@@ sive , because each pixel is split up and down again and again because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colour values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 x 5 will be calculated with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
I would like to know more about abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are followed individually and checked for further sub@@ division .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch to J@@ itter@@ ing , changed &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for the quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card map you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object .
opens a new window for displaying &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expectedly terminated , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select the menu item import ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete set @-@ up of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not want to support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your copy and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene file , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the colour for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type number plates .
you can set the object reception of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high detail faith@@ fulness for extended projections , all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections . this feature gives a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
when you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when viewing the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you click on edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . exact information on parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the Window Systems section , you will be able to create and save window orders .
drop down sel@@ ector window : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window layout when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created by adding the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Rem@@ ove .
with New Col@@ umn , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map view view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , there are no rules for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you don &apos;t insert light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything error @-@ free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and icons and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item .
the wi@@ le view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found . in the user documentation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the target of the camera . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
if you press the user button or touch button , the wi@@ le view and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings . as a result , you will see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert End@@ licher Body Qu@@ ader ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is an aw@@ k@@ ward method of resol@@ ving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite level as a floor :
a good advice : select the plane in the object tree , change the name and press the user button or enter the button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wi@@ le view now shows also the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite final layer . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the item for the floor when clicking on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case you will see only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment choose something simple .
in either case , a dialog opens , where you can select how to insert the object . the pigment will then be shown in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the preview button you will see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigment . therefore , always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see a color on the loader and the ball in the preview , just click the Apply button and then go to the preview .
the material for the floor is now correctly set . if you now render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree select each time mon@@ ochro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already be able to do this step as you should have understood the fundamental way of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you should have understood the ball just as easily as the ground :
in the view of object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the input button or push the button ) , so the sphere has contact with the floor . otherwise , the sphere would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down .
of course , the rendering now produces a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already on the floor , give the ball a pigment as color :
choose first sub@@ object and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on sphere Pig@@ ment , then select the color and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press the input button .
the brightness effects and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metal : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options are available to you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer will shoot hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is just black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and memory space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage have been disc@@ arded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used the undo button .
saves the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; , here you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify or add new commands with this option .
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bars . with this option , you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; add and remove commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient viewing viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select pictures to display .
images can be shown either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can show by clicking on the &amp; L@@ M@@ B@@ n ; or the key return .
you can set if each image is to be displayed in a separate window , or if all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner . if a matching file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Di@@ alogue Ein@@ dressing - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set . in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for each window can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , load &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up to show only some of the file types that the program can also display .
with this option , the display window is enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .

&amp; show@@ shots ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ tab@@ s . to access these settings , you have to choose in the Settings sample panel . the preferences dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left hand .
in the exposure indicator , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ exposure indicator has been selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should contrast the colors with what you want to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ pot ; has a side@@ bar on the right , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page strip in image editing . you can view these by clicking on one of the five riders :
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images .
&amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes them scan and save images . &amp; channels ; can open a dialog for saving each image or save the images in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; utter@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sc@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed driver options . &amp; channels ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) do not treat these options .
in order to scan a picture , the user can start a scan scan only and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the picture and zoom out of the current selection .
if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button .
if before saving a preview is displayed in the settings , then the picture will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you will get back to the main window .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and selecting the Global Tast@@ esp@@ ace . selecting the right mouse button in the player window and setting short commands ... select .
you can set up existing multimedia buttons so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this will make your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browsers , players , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de command line options ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all the required modules are present and make use of a dialogue so that the user knows why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as a base for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; any K@@ DE installation should be included .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages enable the execution of external programs and commands . in most cases , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends al@@ erts to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok sets the folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change indicates that a new piece is being played . the script could now and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , further information about the new track can be retri@@ eved ( for example , the metadata or the unit length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . in order to add an entry to the menu , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; exit , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. saving data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web@@ server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the gener@@ alization of amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is ready , you can hook it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist rather than having to work through endless menus . you may also search for a certain title of thousands in your collection .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists but can never decide which ones you want to listen to ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - exactly the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok springs to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake don &apos;t have any difficulties when comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok , like most applications , has some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . see the system requirements for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without bother with the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the Play@@ list window is displayed .
use m@@ oods bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
disc@@ arding the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , .@@ mood files will be stored in the &amp; Amar@@ ok settings folder ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
when you save the playlist , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist at the end of the playlist .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : if you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , otherwise the absolute position of the music files is saved .
keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , causing the playlist window to roll up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible area of the window .
when changing parts to the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fon@@ ts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled . you can select fon@@ ts for the following area : playlist window , player window , and context browser . press select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with the Sel@@ ection Custom color scheme , you have the choice of the choice and you can set up your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
continue playing at the start causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start playback will automatically continue with the piece in the place with which it was stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen @-@ Display window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is applied , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadows causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . one click on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection . if O@@ wn colors are not activated , the default &amp; k@@ de colors are used .
the display text input field shows the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users . this allows you to specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the card card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate further settings in this card .
the Cart@@ ridge collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , which should search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
recur@@ sively Browse sub@@ folders : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to search for music as well as their sub@@ folders .
monitoring changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folder to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will then appear in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l @-@ Setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; on machine : enter the machine on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the load card last@@ .@@ f@@ m supports the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if needed .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and thus update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed so ( including the programs included in it , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them , for example , to find modules or scripts ) .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by typing in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and app@@ end the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time it is because tag@@ lib crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . disable if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the email opens automatically with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in the met@@ a information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ P &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib ; my $ mp3 = MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib@@ - &gt; new ( $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( shu@@ ffle mode / repetition / dynamic play@@ lists ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . you can sometimes click on a symbol in the control center in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance Pan@@ e . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol for three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you receive this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove each conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to find the correct version first .
there are several possibilities . most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the # Amar@@ ok channel .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter there only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist will appear . how will pieces of music be played there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left @-@ hand side and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to make the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the statistics window . you will find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user , while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces , the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist ; click on the title bar of the playlist and select columns to view . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short@@ cuts . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file into the playlist and drop it there , just as you would do with other files . it &apos;s as simple as that : - )
in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it .
probably missing the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config program . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also check for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . furthermore , you can find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , this is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be what media types are supporting G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support virtually any audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder will be supplied ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously play audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software @-@ Mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and solve a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ ally ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you want a dec@@ or with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts Co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ amer the visu@@ al@@ isations . yes , that &apos;s a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . follow the follow @-@ up register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC -@@ channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download m@@ peg , compile and install it . then execute the logs directory , once as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the latest @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run logs . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report below bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .

thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm execute this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before going to bed , then you wake up from the soft tones of the music that you have stopped before going to bed .
how to know current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running titles when you are on another computer ?

the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist of all for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia player . it has many features that there is in no other player . but don &apos;t be deter@@ red by the abundance of functions , they are all easy to use .
the Play@@ list window can be divided into two main areas , on the left is the navigation area . in the navigation section you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser displays different information regarding the current piece . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , Text and Interpre@@ t . these three sub@@ windows will be explained in detail later .
if you have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may have noticed that the sub@@ window has dropped off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be collected in the Statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .
the first section in this sub@@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to recre@@ ate the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ eces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ ded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pieces there are the favourite pieces of this artist . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the last section , albums of the artist , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will work out and you will see the content of the album .
you can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to begin playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version will then be stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . no running text script is required .
the search button searches a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - groups only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First , the pieces will be arranged according to the performer , and this will be the best view of your collection . if you want to see con@@ stell@@ ations or soundtrack @-@ albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interpre@@ ts .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are alphabe@@ tically sorted among each other . the artist will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces will be sorted first by genre and by artist .
group@@ ing Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine the group@@ ing as you like .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ register your collection as soon as you change anything at the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while .
a search filter is located directly below the tool@@ bar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section for the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box , with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection . you can choose from the last 24 hours up to a year . you can also select your complete collection , which allows the filter to be switched off practically .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options .
load - This will lick up the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .

( n ) move files into du@@ st@@ bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in different interpre@@ ts .
highlight the album - Change a record selected as a compilation album back to a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown under different performers but again under the corresponding artist .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the lower part of the playlist contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for running time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the sub@@ window media player is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , find the pieces on your iPod by performer listed in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list . when finished , click Apply . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive attachment for your iPod .
among the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser , you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from an entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music from there to the Musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop it .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not on the mouse position .
you can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place with the mouse . as soon as you enter letters there are only the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one of two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two and three .
if you enter between the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR 3 . in this example , all pieces containing one or two or three are found ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries by Mike Old@@ field , but not according to entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can search for larger or smaller searches . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field , or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool .
you can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ tr@@ l key , and then right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . entries will then receive a mark with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the tool@@ bar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side you will find the Add button to add the play@@ lists to the playlist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; next , the buttons will follow &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; undo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and restore , so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fied analy@@ zer . the re@@ fres@@ her rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window on the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration via this menu .
there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example , playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up tool@@ bars ...
the Status Bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play time of each piece . furthermore , the status for shu@@ ffle mode and retri@@ eval can be easily changed by clicking the mouse in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , de@@ activate the Status Bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . via this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .

includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , which is supposed to happen , just as if you had called close for each project file .
includes all opened projects and finished &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project it is asked what to do with it as if you have called file closing .
when you access this entry , you can select files for adding to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button B@@ race , der &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful if you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files will remain in the project .
this allows you to copy only one image from a CD which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning in place of the normal copy . you should prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
alternatively , you can only create an image of a DVD , which you can then burn later . furthermore , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of the normal copying . the converting / shr@@ inking of a DVD with the help of copying dialog is not yet supported , therefore the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
open the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete all contents or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog , you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely delete the content .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the B@@ race button .
this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the content view , but can also be used single @-@ sided . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and to cut black edges .
displays information about the inserted media . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is enabled , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , its contents are displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , lock and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium .
the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the header is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog window to change ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the mapping to the bottom .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wiz@@ ard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , you will need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work instantly . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine @-@ tune the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is how many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled e.g. via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program , or the more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is key to which of the teach programs you prefer .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P features , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following on the console :
next to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions which all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ dv@@ d and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String ) void add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : list ur@@ ls , Q@@ String contribut@@ or ) void speci@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String new@@ Name ) void set Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script generates a data project , several folders , and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ EC@@ T cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ Audio@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; readers for &amp; k@@ de ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the en@@ coder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in wa@@ v files on the hard disk ) and by many coding which encoding these WAV files ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they are installed ) .
first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ Audio@@ Creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must now be done .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ able ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to install something yourself .
which coding / file format should be used ? the Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer chapter gives a small introduction about en@@ coder , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , use &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device avoids the protection , it is not possible to avoid the mechanism of copy protection . simply avoid the purchase of copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting must be done only once ( the setup dialog can be inv@@ oked so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , over which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of commands from the main window . step by step , for example , you can find more information about how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configur@@ ing the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the Code settings tab in the setup dialog - the encoding .
opens a sub@@ menu with a list of available en@@ co@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with a different en@@ coder as the default . it should be noted that previously the en@@ coder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full &amp; CD ; read out and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages ( such as logs , be@@ eps ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog for &amp; k@@ Audio@@ Creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as en@@ coder , to set the en@@ coder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , en@@ coder and compression rates and helps you choose the right en@@ coder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate the differences become less important , since both co@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is delivered with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG plays is present .
MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate approximately 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a song . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate approximately 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of young people , portable devices and auto @-@ stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information which are manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program from fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there are often a combination of program settings for the en@@ coder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the en@@ coder explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are en@@ coded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator must be added . the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = but@@ ton@@ 1 in the assistant ) :
this is what fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs , the information to upload / enter , so that all others can download this information instead of entering the machine themselves . it is to be noted that only text is spoken here : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( the editor &apos;s note ) am not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from releasing information publicly on the &amp; CD ; and in addition , the information without the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music business can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; actively select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address than the one installed in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; set up to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually generated monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which selection program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to save the read WAV files , the en@@ coder and so the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the en@@ coder . other en@@ co@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the Ko@@ di@@ erer package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the en@@ coder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined code . more information about the en@@ coder is in the chapter cat@@ cher .
after installing a code , you can get more information about the switch by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the write and read real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio en@@ coder of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not work !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , since it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can do of course .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write rights on it ( eg ; trying to copy something into it with the Kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section deals with the basic set @-@ up of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ Creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD , which needs to be repeated for each &amp; CD .
here we define the encoding of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we divide the program with the fre@@ ed@@ b to load the &amp; CD ; download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at every reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
frequently , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the tab General Settings . here is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything is as loaded / entered as shown in the screen shot .
only in case of incomplete information ask , so that you will be informed when details on creating keywords ( tags ) are missing .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b host .
note : the machine must be connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server during reading the &amp; CD .
the second selection field is simpler , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and file name is changed with kon@@ quer@@ or &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode when you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB big , think twice whether this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . mode is set up on the following card map .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data query , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server on the Internet . how does the system know which data the CD should be received ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we didn &apos;t download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will function as the first attempt .
both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ ggle the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet .
in this example , we don &apos;t want to send any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings of the screen shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of pieces at the same time : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in a private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything .
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a good audio quality setting , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in the event of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of WAV files to be en@@ coded at the same time : with a Du@@ al@@ core or a qu@@ ad or even a multi@@ processor machine , you can try to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; on disk runs . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was written in the previous section as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will need to be retri@@ eved .
since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look slightly different from those for a &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b fet@@ ched data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually , instead of fet@@ ching them from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; find this example . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , the &amp; CD ; in the drive defined in the main window , must be inserted .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , consult the questions and answers section of the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window appears , and you can select the database entry that fits your mind best to your &amp; CD ; matches .
if you do not select the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger it by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 @-@ 02 : the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer has to be entered in the field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments ini@@ di@@ vidu@@ ally per piece , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least for what &amp; k@@ Audio@@ Creator ; maximum allowed .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also re @-@ create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags .
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see the help file for more information .
simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the out@@ source CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org &apos;s website and read the information about the categories . pop or ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . just click on the line with the second slice .
the window of the CD editor will appear and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have captured for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you want .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the &amp; CD .
caution : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be shown above the BO@@ M .
note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles marked in this way will be read out . make sure all pieces are selected , or press the button All pieces Select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if the selection process starts by clicking on the selection of the selection process , this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on .
click on the tab order to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you will see this error when trying to work with a co@@ der that you haven &apos;t installed yet . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we typ@@ ed in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the assignment # 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of Part 1 into the format MP3 . this allows you to read and code in parallel . note the status message in the bottom part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program did not find a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
now the last title is read out while another piece is coded and a third order is written in the queue of the en@@ coder . after the last piece is coded , a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ Audio@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the en@@ coder of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions , however , already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ Audio@@ Creator . install the package k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is intended for persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it runs , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options which are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked after the first start of the program without any indication as to go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if no audio CD is found at the time of the program start ; in the drive ) , or from un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it all about ? if you read this , you probably have already started the program . it should look like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; whoever wants to add or change something useful should do it . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing with this suggestion .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he has also some properties with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts , the other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . AL@@ SA is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( real events or text events ) . k@@ mid will automatically determine the process used .
sitting support . if you &amp; k@@ de ; while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the L@@ up driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; drop windows into the &amp; k@@ mid ; this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the tool@@ bar , select the item play from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you pull it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
as soon as &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece is played , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and using the slider back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display to change the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a play is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the Pause button or selecting the menu item break in the menu item , interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and others both . some pieces do not have a text : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event is automatically calculated using a song so that you don &apos;t have to manually adjust it . so , if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text will automatically be selected , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries of text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played in series . in this section you &apos;ll find how you can efficiently use collections .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Cop@@ y and selecting the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the selected items in the collection manager .
the temporary collection includes all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection won &apos;t be saved . remember when you add many pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialogue appears , with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when Automati@@ cally Ad@@ ding to the Collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) .
if Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequences of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they have been added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list using the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to return a song back , select the Previous piece button , the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but it does not play a role as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map contains general MIDI events in events which the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI Map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano events to the events of the Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except for the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
this section shows how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage looks like this :
please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun .
if now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 ( gun@@ shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the note 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is the term Tro@@ mmel @-@ Patch of the patch , where each note represents another percussion instrument ( drum , bas@@ ins , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always equal drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sound can be displayed on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PA@@ T@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple Key@@ boards for each channel and every instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ boards are mainly used to map sounds on the perc@@ ussions channel . see for example the included keywords .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ NE@@ L@@ MAP section has 16 rows , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern :
n is the channel that is shown on Channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions @-@ channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ benefit events are multip@@ lied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value n , this is converted to the n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed only . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as are available ) .
this setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard , which receives a pitch Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI Map , simply open the dialog MIDI Settings . you will find this in the Settings menu , Spot MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob will not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select Settings under the Single Channel view : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you get a similar sound quality .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t feel like adding all files individually .
OK , so support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ windows .
please activate the automatic addition to the collection beforehand . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , I have to change only into the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and drag the desired file into the &amp; k@@ mid window .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection , turn off the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ E . first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly those a MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ 5 and C.@@ D@@ as and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to continue programming .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the university of Ma@@ acute ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I &apos;m studying programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and pro@@ positions .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ pink @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will count amongst friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me , because I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and won &apos;t get any money from anyone . I would like to stress that I &apos;m only making program@@ mers because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that pitch was too high for AW@@ E cards .
my thanks also applies to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or even a suppor@@ tive email .
and of course my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid ; can also be found on his homepage , which is located at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rac@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . you can also find links to pages with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it is not the same if you are using an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; using the MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL parameter . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course not listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are playing after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent Play@@ lists .
of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you have an entry , his group and all his sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback will begin with the attached record .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . simply click on a name of a category , select View from the View menu and see the next edit mode . by clicking on a sub @-@ group , only the XML contents of this part will be displayed .
after changing XML files , it must be selected from the merge menu , selecting either the Edit Mode , or selecting another category .
all changes will be lost once the editing mode is left or another group will be selected without changing the playlist .
because of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files ..
the animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and alter@@ ing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ iger option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will follow the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation when starting does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying in the end animation , so the user can end the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the indication of one favorite photos : &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; n ; im@@ g dur = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / he@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / ; ; / ; ; / ; ; In the directory tests / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L are supported by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ;
there is a tab to configure M@@ Player in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player configuration dialog ; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c file , just like setting up the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a flash using the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even be played the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module must be specified as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
in order that a given back end is always taken for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play cards using either M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b contained therein .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( presumably this type of playing of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also only supported on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server it must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , K@@ M@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of creation of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ r@@ source .
are there hints how to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as root after connecting the device . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom shows the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does my CPU have to be checked for performance every time ?

document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , project author &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , slides &#91; pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined .
encoding : this will set the character encoding . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editor - the emphasis of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see gre@@ enh@@ y areas of a large text on the screen , it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless .
with the automatic completion of the settings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { instruction } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the closing of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { order } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands to be de@@ activated .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and the sub @-@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex files . as soon as a DVI file ( dependent file ) is created , jumps and ki@@ cks ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code .
a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and other information such as the font and is besides PDF the digital output art of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the back @-@ up search , the elements of the DVI ; file are ski@@ pped with the editor , and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the exact opposite of it . once you cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text , the corresponding position is jumped in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . using a master document , working with others is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings .
quick @-@ build : der &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there are no errors in the source text ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file is based on trans@@ vers@@ es@@ â , and there is no call from &amp; Ok@@ ular ; after quick construction .
when viewing the edit tool@@ bar , you should notice the three large selection fields . the selection boxes have been developed for quick inser@@ tion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; lat@@ ex orders for the sub@@ division are :
the selection field for further items such as keywords , foot@@ notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created .
reference : used for reference to a designated name ( choose a selection field ) .
when using quote , a selection list is displayed with literary entries . for &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex , appropriate editors are necessary . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ r@@ Ã ¶ e is used for defining the font size . it can define the font sizes for the main text , the notes , etc . , the following font sizes are available :
when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the fon@@ ts . if fon@@ ts are not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use menus for building or pushing the button .
the source must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; it automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . if you use quick @-@ build , &amp; Ok@@ ular , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be considered .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } then authori@@ ze the change of fon@@ ts within the environment &quot; ( English Hu@@ ge ) .
the changes will only be cleared inside the environment ( from \ \ begin to environment } to \ \ end { environment } . there is no reduction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , bold printing , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { Word } .
\ \ rate : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background for writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex recording language has been presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le follows .
once a little text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document should be performed . at least one quotation , a few places in bold and itali@@ c pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands .
once the document has been viewed , editor View or C@@ tr@@ l E can be converted back to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , the window must be closed .
once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed out or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for the creation of the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed ( in viewer ) by file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI ; file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into changed other formats can begin with the buttons in the tool@@ bar .
the preview search enables direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex binary files . to do this , just set up Modern under Settings box ...
to display the pre @-@ selection search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source code and then click on preview search . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer is then done .
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; Docum@@ ent the appropriate &amp; lat@@ ex ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this , you need to set &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set up as text editor ( Setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error when using the &amp; DVI ; viewer , there may be an error . if an error is present , this will be indicated in the log file or in the message window .
the log file is the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the pop @-@ ups of the La@@ Te@@ X error and the next La@@ Te@@ X error can be used for jumps between the errors . the log file always gives the line where the error appears . to view the faulty line , the error must be cli@@ cked on the error in the recording and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the faulty line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to select the template to be used for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
when selecting Emp@@ ty Docum@@ ent , a document can either be re@@ written from the ground up or the wizard will be used for the quick creation of a new document . more information on this can be found in the section .
frequent users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created in &amp; boxes ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or a new file created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template by file New , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings box ... Settings generic to be set .
when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into a document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ scope &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can be selected instead of the default .
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex file . if a simple way is used to create a template , you should search for one on the Internet and the steps described below will be executed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for reading and high@@ lighting many different kinds of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and his ability to learn the manual to Kate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; kate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex command reference , which can be called over the Men@@ u@@ help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex and its syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ tr@@ l button to select the &amp; tex ; this means that by clicking on \ \ par \ \ par \ \ authentication just \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with the left mouse button , the selected text will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the Editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for different types of source texts and highlight them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex differs ; -@@ commands from normal text and also mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color .
many assistants can capture additional boun@@ ce marks . these are a kind of book@@ marks within the text . the entries Edit Jump@@ ing marks or the corresponding ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes make the jump to the next or last jump mark .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; though &amp; kate ; already offering excellent opportunities were added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; request special commands for their selection . under Edit select the following commands for selecting the text :
this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands and all other lines of the source code . the only prev@@ entative thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines .
select the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command would also extend &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a back @-@ stroke ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del key . &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; offers with its own commands for faster possibility . under Edit , the following commands are included to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; box ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit Environment for a possible simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
with this command , jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the over@@ look can quickly be lost . this command completes the last opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environmental structure is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups which are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from the edit environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the bra@@ i@@ ded clasp .
if the cur@@ sor is located before or behind the bra@@ ced clamp of a &amp; tex ; group # , the other end of the group will jump ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted welded groups clas@@ ps , the over@@ look can quickly be lost . this command completes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple lines are used as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ els &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; for practical implementation , the character is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used for two simple lines . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and has two closing lines for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic control of the double occup@@ ancy mark can be set up under Settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X will be switched on and off .
it can also be used for specific settings ( e.g. german or French ) and thus German or French quotes . there are also many other languages available .
when shifting from Shift , enter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line break , but at the same time the command \ \ item .
complete within a table environment ; the current line starts with \ \ \ \ with an ending line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; they can be added to settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby assign all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . while shifting from Shift , Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying row .
although &amp; kate ; already offering a good source code completion , this has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special orders ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , there are three different modes . all these modes can be set up for different work styles under Settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely adjusted .
start a new environment using the \ \ begin { environment } command , and automatically add the \ \ end { environment } command after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and it may be mistakenly deleted . on the other hand , the list can be reduced by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed when selecting a command . alternatively , you can insert boun@@ ce marks , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible by means of the actu@@ ating mark button and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings box ; setup ... cases ; complete settings can be made to these lists . it can be selected different lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands as well as native speakers of the general language use .
command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call to completion mode will result in a large list of ambient commands . on the other hand , the environments are often used to provide a special mode for completing the environments .
when calling the Com@@ ple@@ mentary Mode over the menu Edit Com@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive Sur@@ ro@@ unding Area or Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment will automatically be filed and it appears \ \ begin { . afterwards , the environment completion can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key .
after this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; detects that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is filed .
under Settings box ; setup ... Ki@@ le ; Compl@@ et@@ ely settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the chec@@ kl@@ ist of Com@@ ple@@ tion Mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands .
the lists can be set up under Settings box . as an example of a check list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l is used , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completes the word completion mode over the menu editing Ver@@ full R@@ atio or the key / key C@@ tr@@ l + Alt empty button , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ b@@ Ã ¼ cher is not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings box ... Compl@@ et@@ ely disabled . here , the threshold value for displaying the completion can also be specified .
the plot files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / box / complete / mode / complete home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( directory ) or tex .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Graphi@@ cal Activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dialog creates the inser@@ tion of graphics as simple as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PS files are not as popular as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from sites . if the PDF output is used , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf to a PDF file .
to see the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all tools are group@@ wise group@@ wise in the Cre@@ ate , Cre@@ ating , and Cre@@ ating View menu .
for comp@@ iling the source text for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further transformation can be used by Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI file can be converted to a PS file by means of old ; 4 the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and by means of old ; 5 the PS file can be viewed .
when using the command prompt , a viewer is usually called after the comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window is opened every time .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... In this case the following information is requested for the project :
when creating the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ dv@@ d project file .
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script codes . scripts can be managed on scripts in vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can change in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods has :
&amp; lat@@ ex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; TE@@ ex ; and &amp; ly@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . it includes a documentation for the included packages and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete instruction manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex . as this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; boxes ; divided into three important book@@ marks .
because of the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ l ; provided , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tra@@ l ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and boxes ; supplied documents and here a graphic surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the largest advantage is the search for package names or impact filters . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results will be displayed .
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer to the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; box ; is also part of the Fink project , making &amp; Ki@@ le ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X can be executed .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . with the command line interface , you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures the same signature is from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . for each day use different signatures , as with the random signatures , you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ tr@@ l ; N File New . this will receive an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section . if you have typ@@ ed your signature , save it using C@@ tr@@ l ; S File Save or click Save Disk icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; if you are using e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always plenty of signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove in the File Rem@@ ove or click on the icon with the red cross remo@@ ver in the tool@@ bar .
you can select short commands for menu entries . in order to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the key or key combination .
for the use of &amp; k@@ sig ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature code from the output of a command .

all found templates are listed here . it must be noted that the export rules of &amp; X@@ SL@@ T apply . therefore , multiple templates with the same agreement and mode details can be present .
clicking on a template in the shown list moves the text poin@@ ter in the main window to the corresponding line of that file .
local and global variables are shown on a card map in the X@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g In@@ spec@@ tor dialog . the following example shows X@@ SL@@ T source code , where a global and a local variable is declared
by clicking on a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable represents a particular expression , for example
contains , then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button .
when clicking on a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter is placed in the main window to the corresponding line of that file .
the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use combination as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
everyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how outstanding it is . let &apos;s raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more dependent on a terminal ; just click on the icon for the XML processor and finished !
this application expects a inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is in the war@@ med folder , then leave the current folder . if not , then remove the selection of current job folders and specify the desired folder in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time you run my@@ pro@@ c .
as already said , anyone who has worked on the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation already knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book then simply select the current folder . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then simply check the current file . if not , delete the file from the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the file well @-@ format@@ ted is , click the Well @-@ Form@@ ed check option .
to use a &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; Schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG Review is the specification of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has an &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed is already selected in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you simply select the current file . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed by means of the other file selection .
specify the name of the file as the result should be named . the file is usually stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have a bit to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . thus , the plug @-@ in system is very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone is using the plug in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing with the Edit menu . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . if you add plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for un@@ ambig@@ uous identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by searching the team member out of the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for more information about comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can be created an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something is certain in the project . an example would be the recording of the opening and closing of the project , so that later you can see how much someone was working on it , or sending a message when a file is saved , or a script that takes a file to the CVS once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Di@@ alo@@ ges , events can be created , edited and deleted .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project manager .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments using the following things :
insert notes is simple . you can either select the note entry from the editor &apos;s context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text .
in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the chosen nick@@ name of the team member , role in the project should be given the respective area or sub @-@ project leaders , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only over &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using Settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over several pages that are treated one after the other .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . entries are :
cap@@ itali@@ zation of tags : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal wholesale / lo@@ wer@@ case means tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files .
large / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lo@@ wer@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal upper / lo@@ wer@@ case means that attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files .
automatically close the optional tags : if checked , tags , for which the closing tag is optional , will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
update Start and End Tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic creation of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to identify different types of files . by using Standard Ret@@ ur@@ ns , default values can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . however , this setting here is sto@@ cked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . however , this setting here is sto@@ cked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash when the program starts . this is not the same as saving the file .
the preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code simultaneously .
reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has been confused by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message field is used to control the display of warning messages by means of hooks of no more .
the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here , the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of node in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can give a valid group for PHP where the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the best @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not located at a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / lib .
input : this information is passed to the plugin during startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; load component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Only @-@ Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ parts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plug @-@ in : if this is checked , test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the submitted information is correct . select also if the plug @-@ in is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely new . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implement@@ ations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert .
using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with selecting a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the button Options beside the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin selection field , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is displayed . usually appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , all or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is produced , or it shares the plugin with to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a Deb@@ u@@ g request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start running the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is started before a de@@ bug file is started , the script will start with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues .
the Deb@@ u@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include .
the Deb@@ u@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include , if possible .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the directive and go to the next one as if it weren &apos;t the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale and this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a K@@ Part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that you can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works by Keith .
this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help to get better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; capabilities such as car completion and node trees . their simplicity and flexibility makes &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folders and the tool@@ bars . tag folders contain handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how tag XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow quick inser@@ tion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they only contain the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folders carry the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the tag XML elements and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tags is a script function . when using it , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
yes , the tag has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags describing how to show this attribute , &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
speci@@ fies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to reach source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ing together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specify a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a only element type .
speci@@ fies a list of elements ending a tag . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files need to start with an &amp; XML statement : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this function is currently not available . currently , the check only occurs when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class _ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; tags &gt; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for editing DT@@ D settings via DT@@ D . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... are created . clicking on New Action leads to the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the User @-@ defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current key symbol can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) which change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) , start . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in ... actions for ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first , the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ script t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , such as : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts local scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PA@@ TH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replace the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text is unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be entered by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input . options are :
selected text : the selected range of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages sent to the standard output . it can be specified , which should be done with the output written on the standard output , by setting the output field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up .
once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select settings actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available so that an input is possible when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol , that the action represents better , we &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics Show other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 pixels . to change this , select Edit Size to others .
please note that the created symbol does not only help you remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually set as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled , that clicking this symbol will start &amp; lt ; start@@ .@@ tag will insert in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still has to be connected with the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions choose ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the user button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; add functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool@@ bar to set dialog about settings tool@@ bars . make sure the tool@@ bar you want is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the item that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar .
for example , I want a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar .
please note how the separ@@ ator supports the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works .
after new XML does not exist , it will be created in@@ the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your file bar ( s ) to load ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a PHP documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has already done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search for an existing documentation for format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html session 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html session 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in den &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub @-@ folders in the tree with its own contents . there is no known limit for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently displayed at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder displayed ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but pay attention to &amp; &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would be displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and save it to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to use the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . they will not be rich , but proud to have collabor@@ ated in the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . in different places there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with e @-@ mail , tool bar tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . to make an active contribution , we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures that the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private G@@ PG key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can select one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled out ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start the upload .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Tem@@ plate and Scrip@@ ts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , investigated &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag XML format . there is a simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D load and conversion of a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description that should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that should appear in ! doc@@ type Tag , like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / d@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand them and to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . .
global elements are available to anyone who marks &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; everything that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure different tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in the global tree available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements are a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that only this user can use it personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , making the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the card holders with information and the tool@@ bars .
you can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as the current , other or all card fron@@ trun@@ ners , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or run CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tag under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor , using the word under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor or opening the file , if the string is designated as a file under the mouse @-@ cur@@ sor .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new features and associated user requirements .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert ; insert into your document , then click on the icon that represents the tag . now , you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( like anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the presentation with file managers are available for files , projects , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , remove , upload or delete files from the storage media can be done with the contex@@ tual menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context in which they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information to a script . with the right mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cur@@ sor is set in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and re@@ fres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears under the other tree views . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces with it . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab at the bottom of the window , can be accessed via the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about every script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the current document &apos;s mark@@ up . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed T@@ ar archive on &amp; k@@ mail ; if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email , you can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the site of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; instead , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and do not execute here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in PA@@ TH is located in front of its bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would ? well , this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for that the appropriate &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ not ; developer community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why develop what someone else has developed ?
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost impossible .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either enter this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or run help@@ full help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , and the oldest entry is removed .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look in the section on templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there are special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ description , so they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ description , which is the correct way to paste special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to paste &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switch on or off the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very useful when your &amp; PHP ; script gives error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of scrip@@ ting functions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
switching on and switching the problem @-@ porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a click of the mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cur@@ sor &apos;s position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with .@@ web@@ pr@@ y file extension .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project is managed . in Chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions need to be added by means of settings ... or you will be asked when you exit , whether you want to save the tool@@ bars .
removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar still , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables the up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
download a &amp; DT@@ D ; anyone who has made you or someone else and convert into the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and does not exist a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar .
allows access to the current day preferences dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub @-@ menus .
activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inclusion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inclusion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of tool@@ bar den@@ ies that this day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the plugin menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed under the menu items above . click on them . click on an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax highlight mode for the current file . the list of available her@@ ding schem@@ ata depends on the type ; -@@ version .
select the type of line @-@ end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the index card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . by selecting an entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the status bar on the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
the changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
speci@@ fies the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you delete entries from the tool@@ bars or add which and the sequences can change .
this should create a help according to the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically . all these paths and author information fields can be subsequently set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties .
here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ nam@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows files from the local file system to be inserted into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . in server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be integrated . if a project is re@@ started from scratch , do not hook .
with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to your discretion .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the check@@ box , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project Project Properties in the sub@@ window Profile or using Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to above , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read in more on project views .
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
in the sub @-@ window profiles up@@ loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by keeping its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can switch event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was open . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at present .
to open another project , select project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allow selecting a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file is saved automatically . you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there , the files can be managed in the current project .
folders beha@@ ved as well , but the opening and opening entries are missing ... in the context menu with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button is da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal .
the password will remain in the core memory and forget about programs . this option is useful when frequently up@@ loading files is needed and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk - option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high load profiles can be created , so that the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a full @-@ qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in one project , i.e. by simply sharing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted in the Project Tool@@ bar menu or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adjustment of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best custom@@ is@@ able through the tool@@ bar menu . use and Ad@@ ding differ . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the Ad@@ ding Tool@@ bar section .
the tool@@ bars and icons can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with New Action , a New tool@@ bar can be created , other actions such as tool@@ bars can be removed , tool@@ bars can be ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be displayed in the dialog , which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will also be removed and action processed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can set up Tool@@ bars in the menu ... and set settings actions ..
templates are essentially document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; templates are basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supplied templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions set out at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using link@@ ups ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are usually found in the template tree with global templates . more information on the template tree is available .
documents can be created from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents will be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate manner to be efficient .
this kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system based on Jav@@ ascript or Perl . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select Save As a template As a local template ....
as soon as this is done , notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . see the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or in the project file , you can click a folder right and create site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template .
project templates allow a very goal oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert or link files with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files deposited in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / Qu@@ anta / .@@ k@@ de / .@@ k@@ de / .@@ k@@ de / share / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection field with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is configured , then it would disable templates in this path , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , it is likely to be found in a root folder .
this could be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and by copying contents templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers allows you to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you can use context menu ( show right mouse button ) about a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second partition the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cur@@ sor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green symbol indicates the default of &amp; PHP ; source . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editing &amp; PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes in both the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible at the same time and the cur@@ sor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; this mode is already active , pressing the active cur@@ sor from one window to the other , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and source editor is adjustable using settings Qu@@ anta . when selecting V@@ PL ; View , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow .
it is assumed that you want to change the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible . the document Properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the manual coding .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons down . clicking on the list allows to change the content , such as key words on the name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to look for pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rule is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS sty@@ ling template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
use of the cur@@ sor is possible as in a word processor , by moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves peculi@@ arly . text can be inserted by typing and using button or distance key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way through the tool@@ bars , as in the source editor . it must be noted that the inser@@ ting of tags previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , every other surrounding anchor tag must be removed .
some tool@@ bars such as the She@@ ets Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled . you will later work in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for examining style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style template can be tra@@ cked .
to be able to compile successfully , you need besides &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are already present in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : stored in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and activated later .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts during mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , many more useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the mer@@ ging and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; almost into a full file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the merge editor among the differences windows allows you to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this feature .
differences in white characters and tab@@ s are displayed . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if someone alters the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different files .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file . for example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
opening dialog allows you to manually type file names , choose from the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . you don &apos;t have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
by clicking on the folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or mer@@ ging of folders will be initiated . however , if for A a file is selected , for B and C a folder , then used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the two other folders .
if mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active and can be edited . however , it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately . you can also do this later when saving .
the setting button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only compare parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window .
you can also use drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you first need to create two corresponding files , add them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diffusion ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and placing of text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed by the settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , one can see the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
in some programming languages , where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + , for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare isolated cases . )
the vertical line separates the abstra@@ ction column from the text will be interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows . if the line break is enabled , the line is dotted with dotted lines .
the result window ( below the comparison window ) has also an info line with the wor@@ ding output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; edit &#93; when you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparison window frames are used , every difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps return another source . this text appears neither in the final stored file , nor in a marking that you may perhaps copy and paste somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if the sources ignore the numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters .
navig@@ ating mainly to the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page ab , beginning , end , C@@ tr@@ l beginning and C@@ tr@@ l end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the Au@@ ditions window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ below / C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to press the copying button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or C@@ tr@@ l @-@ paste ) . if this is checked , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , because you might accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a line feed character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use jack @-@ feed + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line @-@ ends of the source files , therefore you should not use binary files .
the options and list of most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start . ( menu settings - &gt; Con@@ figure K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fon@@ ts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c script . if the chosen script does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors may not be available in their pure form , but would be sc@@ anned . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically adju@@ sts an un@@ just color .
if this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character will be inserted .
when you press input or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is enabled , each selection will automatically be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . copying the manual to the cli@@ p@@ board is not necessary .
you can select which line @-@ end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white characters are not ignored . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging , white characters are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a line character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a line feed &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the car return character , but then treated like a white mark . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is disabled .
in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
in default , this option is disabled . comments are treated like changes in white characters .
search for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before continuing to the next un@@ resolved conflict .
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and conducting a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging for details .
if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version will be attached to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the currently running program . you need to quit &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is selected there globally via the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
in the coding fields for coding a short notice appears , what the local coding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the coding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different coding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding to be used to save .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option , you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options Ign@@ ore Num@@ bers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are enabled . )
this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences between two of three files are displayed . but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply add the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you look at the differences and then decide immediately to merge the files . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to re@@ boot the merge , then the name of the last used output file is retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches exactly your requirements . you can use this function for example to cut out bo@@ ther@@ some parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre@@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is needed , and most users do not want to program it themselves . good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processing command for line breaks to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all following the same pattern $ keyword sub@@ stit@@ uting $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for line intervals . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , i.e. virtually deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several sub@@ stitu@@ tions at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the sub@@ stitu@@ tions . for example :
instead you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ How@@ ever , per@@ l requires some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for viewing and mer@@ ging . other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre @-@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and , in the worst case , destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare &amp; merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it ,
... perform selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging single files . you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog .
when three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not mer@@ ging . to start mer@@ ging , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details will follow )
when you read the folder , you will be informed by a small message window about the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that were compared to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folder shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click , or double @-@ click on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions to fold all sub@@ directories and open all sub@@ directories with which you can open all the folders .
when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the clas@@ h action cannot be automatically chosen . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as seen in the picture above , the colours red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders , age is irrelevant for its color .
the idea to this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such bad objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such bad objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the Sync mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist , but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge is selected , then investigated &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not removed , mer@@ ging the folder cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , one file is processed by another . the status column shows Fer@@ tig once the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is ok everywhere .
if a Full analysis is selected in the setup dialog , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , not white and white conflicts . ( the resolved conflicts column is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or folder ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then you will use C as the target in the Three Fol@@ der merge mode , and B will be selected as the target in the two folders merge , and A and / or B will be used for synchron@@ izing .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that might be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key short@@ cut ) . to only merge the current entry : select action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if invalid merge actions exist by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that indicates the defective element . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Canc@@ el options .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( mer@@ ging a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / continue / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog will appear . then execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; continue your work with the next entry .
if you encounter a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to check the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged together , remember &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and do not merge them together at the later compilation of all entries . even if the merge operation was ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be considered finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 settings menu ( Set Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called Fol@@ der merge with these options :
only files matching the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a default attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a previous dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
when the option is turned on , the links are treated as normal folders and searched recur@@ sively . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checked for possible recur@@ sions ) . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is switched off in default .
complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders with a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size . this can be useful e.g. when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates the synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical .
if there are differences , instead of mer@@ ging , copying the newer file as an action is suggested . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been modified either . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another backup , the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal mer@@ ging of single files , not just mer@@ ging whole folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder mer@@ ging view keeps visible during mer@@ ging single files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
you can also directly merge a single file directly without having to run the folder . as soon as you save the result , the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you start folder mer@@ ging .
however , this status is lost when you read the directory again : directory menu : new to read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open , located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contained . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes because of the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . there is a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder . then always a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modi@@ fying date . therefore , the permission or modi@@ fying date differs from the original . ( please refer to the Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the Size . ) ( This is only possible for local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P . K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ DE@@ VE@@ LO@@ P from the contex@@ tual menu .
normally you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as K@@ Part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ nu@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compact ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or that they will go .
you have compiled the program from the sources and probably don &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , then these lines are treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . if similar lines disappear to each other , this is more often the case .
the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to simply drag a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file , and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort has been too large so far . you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is r@@ ins@@ ed ; No sr@@ c is left ; it appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and miss the purpose . please use another editor for this purpose .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all the features of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
for information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE , please visit the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diffusion 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir speci@@ fies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake use if you have no problems with comp@@ iling . if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of this .
cut out ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy to the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Shift ) insert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current cur@@ sor position or replace the current selection .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging them . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button .
in default , this option is disabled . different characters ( e.g. &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini @-@ preview of all virtual work@@ tops . it is quite practical to see the running programs on the working surfaces , change their size , quit them or move them . this works both within a desktop as well as in several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other .
with the middle mouse button , windows within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved ; motion is possible both within a working area and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager to set up ... and Be@@ verage . if , however , on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , there will also be the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ izing , maxim@@ izing , On Desktop and Finish . the commands cause the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ spaces .
when this field is crossed , in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual working areas are displayed .
tick this field lets the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is enabled together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , eg ; 1st Desktop .
if this field is enabled , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this field is enabled , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise , only empty work@@ spaces will be displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the windows with their standard symbol and Pix@@ ar shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ ar is recommended only for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications appear in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display windows as symbols or with their contents and move . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up switch settings ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently , this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have write permission for the file , you need to login as user root or turn to your system administrator .
da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the k@@ de@@ base package , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages .

this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded with new features . it is optimized for use on high performance machines .
when you start &amp; K@@ mag , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is referred to as a magni@@ fying window . the image displayed in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window .
as an alternative you may want to display a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop@@ down display mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cur@@ sor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard tab ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cur@@ sor .
in the drop down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse poin@@ ter in the magni@@ fying window and hold down the left mouse button , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also works with the arrow keys .
in addition , if you press the &amp; Shift key or press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection window .
with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays firm and only the lower right corner is moved .
you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more .
start or stop the update of the display . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0 .
select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document rel@@ o@@ ad in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Shr@@ ines &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen shot . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; use an area of the screen to zoom as if you would use a magni@@ fier in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual han@@ dicapped .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / K@@ mag ( enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start help@@ full help : / K@@ mag ) .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click when the mouse cur@@ sor stays in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ Panel @-@ Syndrome ) and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click when the mouse cur@@ sor stays in the same place for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this hasn &apos;t happened yet .
to make it clear again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
is the intelligent shift enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the move , before releasing the mouse button is executed . in this way , you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button .
this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click brings out .
if Intel@@ ligent Posi@@ tioning is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is enabled . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button , wait before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime .
this move is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ bos@@ .@@ txt , when it is started , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose Sound System and here the General tab . there &apos;s a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; Start &amp; k@@ de ; Start . this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the respective documentation for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically .
all settings are reset to the settings that were set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last press is pressed .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent moving should be turned off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the intelligent shift .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; with sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of which areas a mouse click will remain without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window , which does not link , will not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again .
if your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to pull out the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . you can easily scra@@ pe the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent move in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cur@@ sor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor wherever you want it . however , use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . secure zones for the mouse cur@@ sor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bars and menus and the tit@@ le@@ bar of windows .
I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to highlight text , copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and move it again or perform any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when to move the move time when it is smart . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use , the X@@ Test @-@ extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . that should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse cur@@ sor as soon as the mouse cur@@ sor leaves . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain to the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows dum@@ b users to let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be re@@ spoken .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the speech output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose text passages without typing them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the word@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be included in the word translation .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the sentences already spoken ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you have set k@@ mouth , you can enter the phrases you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry ; set up ... open the preferences dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the Wor@@ ter@@ ge@@ ese page as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the voice card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the selection field below the input field , place the character encoding with which text is passed on to the language generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed on as standard input to the language generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation to your language generator . examples of this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
the kt@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; uses a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a passage passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a passage in the text passage book or in the bar for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages the selected passage is directly spoken and additionally added to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . with the selection of In the input field , the selected passage of the text is entered first only into the input field .
the second drop @-@ down menu for the text pass@@ book editing window allows you to specify whether the text pass@@ book should be saved automatically when the processing window is closed .
with the selection of text pass@@ book , the book is saved . if you choose to make changes , the text pass@@ book is not saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be stored .
in the main window next to the input field displays &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the name and in the drop @-@ down box the language for the dictionary .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read &amp; k@@ de ; then read the dictionary . in addition , you can compare the word@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted .
with this option , you create a new empty dictionary with no entries . as &amp; k@@ mouth ; add new words automatically to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main part of the window to edit text passages is divided . in the upper part , the text passages are shown as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage of the text or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage , you can only change its name .
add actions such as new text passages or books or del@@ eting selected text passages and books you can either reach via the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the sequence of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sections of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text will be copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sections of the exp@@ iry cache .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected phrases of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
if this menu entry is enabled , a mov@@ able tool@@ bar is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is arranged by default over the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar is displayed in the bottom part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is enabled , a sli@@ dable bar for text pass@@ books is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location .
probably you did not correct the command for voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the voice card speech output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
the Festival is a speech @-@ over@@ sight system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . the license allows you to use the Festival for free and without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival directory .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java ; currently it only supports English pron@@ unci@@ ation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without any restrictions .
to display an example for the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ad folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command examples :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . )
M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a wa@@ ve@@ file , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA to use M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax would like to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( Cat - ; echo &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . sending the data as standard input must be enabled .
the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the voice generator is set only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth .
you can use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog , when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to be successful , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB of memory ( and additional memory for the language generator ) , but this depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with people who cannot talk , can output text by the computer . a list of already spoken pro@@ positions is stored , which the user can always re@@ charge .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . on the computer , a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed .

reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; kate ; even if &amp; kate ; in other &amp; k@@ de ; applications embedded .
speech output is provided by the speech pro@@ pat@@ cher program , which uses various background music such as es@@ peak , festival , &amp; etc .
enables the creation of language expenditure on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; auxiliary program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages such as Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; kate ; with which a text file can be read in whole or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ tap .
before you can use it , you will need to install and adjust the speech pro@@ pat@@ cher program .
at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card board is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card board is displayed in General . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up multiple versions for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise use the speed dispat@@ cher as the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the card champion Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card board will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list above . the top speaker is used for speech output if an application does not present a speaker .
with a mouse click select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to move the speaker in the list below . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
select a voice type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a male and female voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the board of cards . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can almost use it . go back to the tab General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) enabled , so the T@@ TS service of &amp; k@@ de ; starts . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read text .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start the &amp; k@@ de voice output system . click the tab General to open this card map . here you can set some general options .
tick this check box to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card map is displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marking , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; further , if the field speech output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will automatically appear in the Control Panel at the preview window , it will disappear as soon as the reading is finished .
with the buttons in this series , you can start , cancel , stop and record text orders .
with the buttons in this series , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; read cli@@ p@@ board or open a text file for reading . you can also change the speaker for an order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; click Apply or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; then all changed settings will be applied on all sides . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the card card orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and check the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that should be read before , and select text to read in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ ten@@ ders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . then check the text that should be read before , and select text to read in the main menu . then the speech output should begin .
this works even if &amp; Ds ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ Noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system ; you can notify you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up a message when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by e @-@ mail , and also the print@@ out / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as provided . read also .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before being sent to the speech pro@@ pat@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unci@@ ation , to replace incorrect spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker or to avoid certain short@@ com@@ ings of voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand the way filters work , it is important to know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program works with a text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen readers is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved for hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the issue of warning .
news have the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses news . while you &amp; eg ; read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who just enters the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each job you send from the map sheet is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of lengthy texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four order types are executed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and finished .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
character labels replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be provided either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be delivered with pre@@ defined string replacement filters that allow the creation of chat @-@ emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form .
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for transl@@ ating &amp; X@@ HTML ; contained in S@@ Sm@@ l .
with voice selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program , which has the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for a speech output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter .
if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification is sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom . processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of furnished normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in turn from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
for setting string replacement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expression as a comparison sample . if the text is found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Er@@ ase column . the list is processed in the order shown from top to bottom .
click here to move the word selected or the regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list of a file , app@@ end the entries from the file to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the speaker for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button at the mouse click .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
you will get the application id running programs with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter copies .
the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters will apply if they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the character label replace regular expressions in the \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
in this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions find in the package k@@ deu@@ ti@@ ls .
X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . but it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility has to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable PA@@ TH , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
with the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection Filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice . see .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filter passes , it searches for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker features that the program proposes , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; click the button to get help when entering .
in order to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , that is , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected , which is best suited to the requested requirements . click on the right button to display the language selection dialog .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the dial @-@ up filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Fil@@ ters if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the language edition API , by &amp; k@@ de ; where program@@ mers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the voice syn@@ thesizer , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the &amp; k@@ de language edition API . see the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice @-@ sharing services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of text for reading and option is a language code such as eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands ,
open two &amp; console ; window . start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the named voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; de@@ formation filters , but when using the module for festival sites , websites are not read pre@@ mat@@ urely .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you need to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . furthermore , you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice to read web pages . also , make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable PA@@ TH .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks appear to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish is spent . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct language value . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be remedi@@ ed by a string replacement filter . see .

the &quot; speech @-@ Dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to extend &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of S@@ Sm@@ l and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not absolutely necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including the packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ dispat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ boun@@ t@@ .com or downloaded the tar@@ ball currently created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you start &amp; Desktop , first check if speech @-@ dispat@@ cher works correctly with your voice syn@@ thesizer . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf for this purpose .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of what is being used by the speech @-@ dispat@@ cher program . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr schedule should be further developed in such a way that the use of speech @-@ dispat@@ cher is possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is broken down into individual sentences . the user can withdraw sentence or paragraph , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application gives text to &amp; kt@@ ts , you can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender female , this will be used , otherwise the best suited speaker will be selected automatically . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker sel@@ ects , you will see in after .
if you click the Spe@@ aker on Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the Cart@@ ridge Spe@@ aker Setup will display . for example , the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . details of the modules will be found below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PA@@ TH , you only have to enter the festival .
select the character encoding for text delivered to festival . for voices , which are &amp; kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 apply , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
this slider lets you adjust volume , speech speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a few controls and display this grey , the voice you have chosen doesn &apos;t allow the settings you have chosen .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to load . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click Apply ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will display at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column ID on the card @-@ card speaker .
with the buttons in this series , you can move on or off in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes to the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) will be taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will become a symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio card audio . see also .
here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of Screen Re@@ aders , War@@ nings and News are not displayed . more information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled or frac@@ t@@ ted without support for the appropriate audio module ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds roughly half and 200@@ 5. ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out which device works with you . in doubt , choose Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a higher priority message . &amp; kt@@ ts ; handles four types of language orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . once the issue of the screen readers has been read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after reading the warning .
news have the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who enters the space .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the incoming message .
the settings on this card map are valid for normal text orders only . for messages , warnings and the editions of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the notification messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card card noti@@ fications will appear .
tick this check box to disable &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; don &apos;t read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , al@@ erts when a sound is played are not read by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; should do when an event arrives . you have the following selection options :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the speaker you want . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is shown in the list on the card @-@ card speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All al@@ erts for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list ) . you can set the al@@ erts as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for al@@ erts to a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( S@@ Sm@@ l ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains stamps for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . S@@ Sm@@ l is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; S@@ Sm@@ l only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you need to install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of S@@ Sm@@ l .
if the speed or pitch settings in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 nbsp ; % , S@@ Sm@@ l text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! doc@@ type speak PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p : / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / speech @-@ synthesis / syn@@ thes@@ is@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are two types of filters - normal filters and sets of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single sentences . this allows you to start reading or stop the first set , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not directly support this .
here you see the pun@@ ctu@@ ation filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as default . you can change its settings or add other pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , but beginners will get away from it .
the easiest way to learn is to set up the language selection by selecting it . turn on the language selection and enter the text to read . switch on the language selection , change some properties and check how the speaker is selected . of course , you have to set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the regular set detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing .
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for by@@ laws and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator character ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab@@ s are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers .
if you have removed the normal pun@@ cture recognition filter from default , you can paste it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can over@@ write the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spe@@ akers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings for the application on the card card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; panel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; menu . &quot; &quot; &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the card @-@ card speaker ) . in other words : no speech qualities are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker with all features of a speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is most likely to match the originally set features .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select the method to enter the desired speech properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
select the properties of the speaker you want . if this feature does not play a role , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markings here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this feature . the only case that you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click the standard speaker on the select button and then use the speaker that best matches the following .
in this case 0 is for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a job number . ( without order number the input is 0 ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr crashes immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts ; you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved by this , you may need to install a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; console ; a message appears which states : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
on your system , there is the problem that conflicts in AL@@ SA are occurring that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . for possible solutions , please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I loaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice .

for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the PA@@ TH environment variable . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ land@@ mod@@ s such as Festival Interactive also offer a setting for speed on the card card for subscri@@ ber setup . depending on the chosen voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; reads . ( this is because HTML is transformed into S@@ Sm@@ l . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ S@@ Sm@@ l @-@ forming filter , and set up the speech speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice .
for Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival doesn &apos;t produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert S@@ Sm@@ l to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer pre@@ - or go back . on the tab order it appears that the order consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ?
pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clam@@ ation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to be filtered out . use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation recognition instead .
AL@@ SA ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . AL@@ SA is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer , using G@@ Stre@@ amer in &amp; kt@@ ts . ( HTTP : / / g@@ asp@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes when you pause a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) .
as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support any real p@@ auses . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will still be read .
the audio program so@@ x is used for general speaker setting , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .
if you have downloaded as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , login as normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands :
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a running time depen@@ dency of non @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution policies ) .
as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS environment variable , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . for example
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the correct folder for programs translated from sources .
source apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
before you use it , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer is working properly . follow the instructions you received with the syn@@ thesizer .
festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you must install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male bri@@ tish ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software into festival / lib / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter MS@@ U _ ru@@ _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , please search for the CDs of your distribution first .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 encoding is required .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like , for example , ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
festival can be used together with the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; syn@@ thesizer . then Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; not a complete voice output system . &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival generates this from &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German lyrics Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the Festival to use &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; folders , but in the folder festival / lib / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of the festival for german &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; required is either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; M@@ B@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded .

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selection of K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package has been designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network settings will be displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting the k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware is not able to install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network characteristics .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed and installed when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module will be loaded when the network settings option in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when starting the module network settings , it tries to automatically detect the used platform on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and release status . by marking the setting of non @-@ recurring requests , the setting can be made permanently . the next start of the network settings will then automatically default this selection .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in system management mode , click the system management mode at the bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the module &apos;s entire functionality is available . it is divided into three riders :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Network interfaces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab is used to manage network devices . all available network devices are displayed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Network interfaces &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button and show the dialog with further options .
by selecting Automati@@ cally the TCP / IP settings are made by a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be done at the same time with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at every system start , therefore no further adjustment is required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , can be selected .
with the selection manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be made without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask , the sub@@ net mask must be set .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or switched off as required . switching off an out@@ dated network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the needs . switching off an activated network device is de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .
speci@@ fies the IP address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which medi@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the machine requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed , or changed . DNS entries can be ranked by selecting an entry and additions or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons down or down in the priority list .
by clicking the Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It is displayed the dialog edit .
the list Nam@@ ely known calcul@@ ator describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of Nam@@ ely known computers contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still in the test should replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the familiar host and click Add .... Add New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click the Add button . if the well @-@ known machine has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the alias name .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select an entry of an especially known computer from the list and select Edit ... Edit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings you have made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be done in a &amp; console ; the following command will be dep@@ rec@@ ated .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) , when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
installing the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface tool such as a package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; instead , the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this is recommended only to experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic networking technology ; in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf is discussed ; modi@@ fiable configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace any further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is communicated to a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never found widespread dis@@ sem@@ ination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to pass through in the near future . this description therefore focuses on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is to know which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is running or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area dedicated to this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all the hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called default route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own host ) . the default route is required for IP for@@ warding .
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to its own lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this section are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; they are affected and where they are stored in the different distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is shu@@ ff@@ led by the scripts in Su@@ SE config . another stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar to fast , selective packing .
before a tape can be used , it needs to be connected by &amp; k@@ dat ; it can happen in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; cle@@ ars the tape and reads the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognizes and k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ ing on the tape does not , you will be asked if the tape should be format@@ ted .
recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; the default , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the belt index is to be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the tape will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape has been integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the volume of the tape can now be searched for the tape by folding the entry .
before ej@@ ection of the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; notes by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be disc@@ arded without danger .
before a band can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires format@@ ting before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted before use . flo@@ ppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after input of the band name and the capacity is running &amp; k@@ dat ; with the format of the tape away . all data on the tape will be lost . once the format@@ ting process is completed , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder will be backed up .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
highlight files in the local file tree with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Glos@@ sary in the File menu .
once the backup is initiated , the dialog opens . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog box will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
once the check@@ out has been started , the dialog appears for verification . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the check @-@ in settings , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the exam process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before initi@@ ating the restore , the files to be recovered must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . only the selected file or sub@@ folder will be recovered .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check@@ box . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will appear . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the job folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band index using the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index in two ways :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup job :
the current job folder in which the backup is to take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files in it will be backed up , located on the same file system as the folder . folders , which are located on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , can be stored separately in backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independent from the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before using tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of the buttons &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the settings can be set up using the menu item &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ D@@ at &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the Settings menu . you can set the following settings : &quot; &quot; &quot;
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is incorporated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be done .
if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; lock the ej@@ ector in the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , the release of &amp; k@@ dat is automatically ej@@ ected ; do not use this option in flo@@ ppy @-@ stre@@ amer .
not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case , tell the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat , a volume is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file named in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file / folder .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is included .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files . furthermore , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available , with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first try to open the most important protocol file of the system - the system log . if this is not displayed , and it opens itself instead of a small message window , you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely not run with system administrator privileges . the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log folder , for which normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion or set string . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed to fit the selected filter .
you can , of course , select another entry at this point . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the process column process , and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file , so you can see &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . minutes lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspic@@ uous color than minutes of step note . the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off in alignment dialog .
if you want to show only a certain process ( e.g. in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the process column . for example , this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter strip .
in addition , you can enable the option to skip to new lines from the main window &apos;s context menu to display all the new protocol rows .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log message in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website to ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ org you will find further information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program starts when the system starts up in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further here on historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is located under / s@@ bin and not / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort contains r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service that you want to start when you boot up the system or switch to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; system services do not include such things like set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d .
the kernel looks at different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one that it finds .
the default Run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is 3 . if you want to change this , then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have a bit mess@@ ed up then you will repair it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts now ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no proper files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very easy : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; have a server running level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc . moreover , I could also have a user running level , that &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . the entry is removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this only happens when you pull out an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries will be moved if you drag them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you need to explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the tr@@ ash bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cur@@ sor keys to make a selection above or below the previous .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ tion ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the Properties dialog . use the tab button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they will be recovered from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings will be stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard running levels , and now the machine is constantly rest@@ art@@ ing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions but is not a standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v are planning an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the system service ( and also if they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply quit without a message if their configuration files are not present or configured incor@@ rectly .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ time varies from distribution to distribution , may even vary from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must save them . either use the corresponding icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user and user group list . to edit , select the user or group you want with a double click on the entry . the dialog appears user and group properties .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only when you have enabled wild@@ card limitations ( quota ) for users will create a card card on which you can make individual settings . other flash@@ cards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD un@@ ic@@ iled .
the password management card file appears , if shadow passwords , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , as installed in BSD uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if space limitation ( quota ) is activated and initi@@ alized for at least one embedded file system ( recognizable by the file &quot; quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be individually adjusted for each fil@@ esystem . the current fil@@ esystem is selected using the field file system with space limitation .
the Standard Group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group &apos;s dialog features include a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works an@@ alog@@ ously .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ maker , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add the default operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
