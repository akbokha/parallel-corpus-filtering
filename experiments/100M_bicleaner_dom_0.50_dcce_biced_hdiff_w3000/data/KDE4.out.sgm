<seg id="1">Translate the module website into the & konqueror; menu under Extras Website. select the original and destination language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated in place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translations are only very rudimentary. Babyelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations do not make any important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages can be translated. other texts should be translated directly on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror;. despite their small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information on how to use & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, select Settings Extensions.... Open the card map tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the kde package; addons. please note that if you have additional software installed on your system, you may need more modules.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains, before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Extras Discover. then you can view the page that has brought & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if available.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View filter module (also called folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras Notification Filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root tip of the document, for example: documentary element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root-node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative to the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The feature of & FSView; is to graphically represent nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called Tree-Map. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportionally to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size of a folder shows the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if it is far below the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; an entry in the Treemap Presentation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle, which is switched over view mode, can either be depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the illustration of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the appropriate file or folder. for each property, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough room for representation or whether the area of subordinate rectangles may occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">In case of display algorithms for Treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always respected. it is drawn frame to make the nested entries are no longer available. note that less space for the frame is lost if the rectangle is quadratic.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the surface of an entry for the subordinate entries is done is left to the implementation. in this context, it is always advantageous for labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames so that rectangles arise which are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimally displayed area for an entry over the menu item view view at area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally, & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets developed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the module picture gallery in & konqueror; menu under Extras gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the module picture gallery, a dialog opens, with which you can set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "the" "" "Title" "" "option allows you to edit the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field." ""</seg>

<seg id="30">In the Folder Folder, specify where the gallery is stored and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save In HTML file, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">To include the subfolder, you can set the subfolder with a slider or a turning field, until what level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "copy the original images to the" "" "Copy" "" "box to copy the original images to the gallery." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">To use the comment field comment file, you can specify a comment file for the caption of images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the mini thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; -Settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; -Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation area can be found in the & konqueror; View menu under the navigation pane or with the button F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click on the & konqueror's navigation area; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser identifier adds a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser identifier of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change browser identifier into one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that refuse to access browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser detection to call up with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use your own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this outdated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & editing; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">You can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE image plug-in interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digikam; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as the camera or the lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digikam; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and opportunities for improvement.</seg>
<seg id="60">If you are in the program, the Help menu contains one entry problems or requests reports.... This opens up a dialog with an underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all required information is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">Digicode; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer will help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, we would like to ask you questions to other users of & digikam. however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicode; visit the website to find news about released versions and other information about & editing.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digikam; to participate, is registration in the developer mailing list. instructions for signing in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you are editing & editing; for the first time, you'll be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your machine. here, the data retrieve is saved. this path stays the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digicode; will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard disk, you can specify the topmost folder that contains images as a base folder. & digicode; considers every subfolder as an album. no image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">You can't exclude sub-folders unless there's iste in hidden folders. this allows you to insert an extra layer before the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos than symbols. you can change the albums by using any picture from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can go in & digicode; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use my albums and my keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw data support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, editing & editing may also work. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh Decoder2 and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & editing; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, each medium and every card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; memory cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realised using the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Photo2 is a free, extensible software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete.</seg>
<seg id="77">The exif support is required by some libgphoto2 camera operators to read the preview images. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, you may not see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plug-in Interface Project (manual) is an approach a common module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoAlbum, Shovimg and gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way how it can be a user. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & editing came; even carry out.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the alve, above the horizontal divider line or into another application window. the only limitation is that you can't put an image in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields displayed in the symbol view right now. so, the filter will work on the file name only if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed can be configured in the Albensettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were created on the hard drive, or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the picture is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right-click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection created by you will be used to sort your photos when you want to add or delete collections from the collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The buttons Elder, Average, New Year: these set the date to the oldest, the newest picture or the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first select an album in & editing, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album symbol, you have to click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As Albumpreview winenquot; select. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">Album collections have a different effect. the collection includes all the photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two louvers in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait a little while the preview images are generated. you can avoid this by using all preview images in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the associated preview. what information this is, you can change settings editing; set up. select the albums page and adjust the preview pane to suit your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse cursor rest for a moment over a picture. the help shows the most important features including all key features of a photo. the screen shot at the top of the introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that is available at & digikam. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that suits you. the image editing shows your photos and allows you to get a number of improvements to this. you can easily view all the functions with & editing; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the pictures.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Picture Edit... or selecting the right mouse button and editing.... in the editing pane, you will find a manual on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It may happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by clicking the right mouse button and selecting the program from the menu of opening. to do this, and how to adapt it to your needs, you will find information in & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image editing programs, problems with the metadata contained in the image can occur. some programs do not store this data with when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture, etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">The easiest is to select it with the right mouse button on the preview and select Rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you maintain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo from & digikam, it will be moved to the bin of & kde; move. F8 Image Delete or Del In case you want to actually really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">& quot; My DatumListequot; organizes your photos using the data. & digicode; uses either the EXIF date or, if it is not available, the date of the last change of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keyword provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all the photos selected with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. by this you can logically organize your keywords. you can also find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG, so you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords using the right mouse button either on & quot; My sampling quot; or on an existing keyword. if you add a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will become the substitch of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword will be removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by moving it to the desired position in the tree and put it there. then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to move the keyword. a keyword can only be once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and editing the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree & quot;</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album symbol, select the picture with the right mouse button and select As Albumpreview in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want with a keyword, you can drag them to the appropriate keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword quot; drag and drop them. alternatively, you can also right-click on the preview of the pictures and select keyword references from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can select a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you assign one of the keywords to it assigned keywords. in this way you can give a cue for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was taken, one for the event in which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, it will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can right-click the context menu of the photo and select from the key menu Remove. the menu only displays the key words assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a timeline-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame you only have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame which indicates the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. this appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps, and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">If you click here, the filter will be deleted and all images will be displayed again. if the search did not find anything, then the lamp is red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you entered as a search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search is done. the results will be displayed in the view My search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after searching, you only have to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit your search form, the search will appear again with the previously entered search information. if you select As Extended Search, the dialog for the advanced search will appear to change your previous search. here you will find more rules for searching.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters, with which you can search in certain fields of & digicode; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. one option can be added to this list with search group / Search group can be deleted or deleted from it. each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least...</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows you to compare images by comparing these signatures. the lower the difference between two picture signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar items: this is an area in which you can drop any picture to find a similar. by means of a swellerts, the results can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from anywhere on the symbol of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free-hand color sketch: draw a fast sketch and digits; find the matching images. also here a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can drag the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your Geo filter, which will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digikam; provides a lamp in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Choose one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the lamp table and its window opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview panel you can drag the images you want to compare to the left or right of the window and place it there. a small arrow shows you which copy in which window pane is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly fade out of a picture series. if you navigate from the toolbar, the first two images will automatically be loaded into the fields to compare. the right-hand side image is displayed in the right area. this makes it easy to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the luminaire like e.g. F4 file Edit....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right sidebar of the main window is available for both preview images in the backlight. for example, this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section, you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. in order to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB; hold down in mode preview then both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom in the same way as in other views. just use the zoom controller under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images when you are in the Preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">Digital inventory management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final edition and the permanent storage. each of the photos receives, scans or digitally stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this however not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos. we focus on the methods for digital photographer editing & editing; we view the download, rename, remove, convert, group, save, optimize, wait and export image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management takes up, indexes, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, in accordance with your definition, data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to assert if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer then you need no longer find a particular photo. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then you definitely do not use & editing;. the approach to store the metadata in both a database and in the image files guarantees very fast searches and a secure archiving to which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether to have access to your photos, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc. be sure that you have to switch to a bigger drive at some point.</seg>
<seg id="151">Holiday pictures can quickly be found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; then export is then a folder for pictures you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separating file types makes batch processing easier. separate new ones from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and work files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend saving the metadata option in the editing page of the metadata in & digicode; this ensures that EXIF- and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what? to do so, editing & editing a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, since you should now assign keywords, labels and an evaluation to each photo. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's go with keywords, keywords, as you frequently call in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digikam; automatically build the tree for you bzw the pictures to the right place. changing the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is overlapped. this is a very coarse representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar dates are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to labels or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You want to share your photos with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. you are sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Take a look at this panorama. from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I say to you this the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you begin to dream, to have associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the inscription has changed your perception of this panorama completely.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others looking at your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer to help him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digikam, you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as lettering. KDE even provides you a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels are exported to your wishes in the lettering and / or the title of the web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation is now driving with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already innumerable and will still be deepening in the future. I am sure one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips with geographic data. & digikam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a pun with copyright and designates the practice the copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all modified versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information came from the editing page of & digikam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to protect the photographer's name, for example to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">This field contains the photographer's work name. examples of this can be titles such as: employee Photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Editor (synonym for provider): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organisations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify this image embedded in the image. for individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermark is unique in each image. digicode; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: plate defect, plate failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, recovery, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, widening superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you even in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section we are dealing with problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">In order to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, you must not trust them for more than a few years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that requires a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you just have been written. therefore, they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a convenient program called IsoBuster which seems to perform miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are similar applications that read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray disks seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual-layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device to high-quality media in a non-expropriated format. then read the data again with a description, date & author and then store on a clean, dark dry and protected site. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers warranty covers a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the troubleshooting mechanisms of hard drives: disk error study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest when operating in the Temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower temperature tures, the fault rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of errors, SMART cannot detect these errors.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also have data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices don't matter much, the devices with computer chips and high speed processors are different. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause scratched keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. so protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is a surge protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug-in strip.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard. this guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used on your computer, you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as there is also a telephone connection for your modem. others offer overvoltage contactors that also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and are therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for on the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in an uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. this gives you the ability to store your data and rearrange the system. some models also allow them to continue working until the current runs. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its safety in power failure with the cost to avoid this. a high quality over-voltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20 euros. this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected by this.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web-Service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can include it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">However, compared to the hard drives at home, they are very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollar; 75 per year and 400 GB cost & dollar; 500. moreover, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are referenced to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not have your pictures in full resolution Online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of the data backup, the web solutions are very secure. thanks to the TCP protocol, transmission errors are automatically cleaned and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory. thus, they are deservant.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the ZFS and btrfs file system provides at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one tells you if a transmission error occurred, not if this happened in your hardware. all these interruptions remain undiscovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet using its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not affected by transmission problems right now, you should look into the future. already in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can handle disk errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has launched an own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protection mechanisms that ZFS uses and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it causes less damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most common filesystems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely saved before the problem occurred it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings away from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural boundary for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of the 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is worse. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so don't make anyone else responsible for data loss. so, keep your data on a plan every year and test this backup before you make anything hazardous like the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backup on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash strikes you lucky if the drive wasn't connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget plane accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually concern an entire room or the complete house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, to the neighboured house, to your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as mentioned above is a common reason for a data loss despite backup the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files should be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot at two time points: the complete backup and the last differential backup.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. it generates several snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such backup was made.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference between files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Back up important images right after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure gives you enough time to discover and restore losses. at the same time, you come up for the backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month. any further dilution should be done manually after you have made a complete review.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored IPTC data stored in the image file, associate XMP files, original storage, storage, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So precious pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">Since the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you need to consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate as time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. the fewer variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should review your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist pressure for the ability to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and you want to expand the range that you want to expand to a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the dmesg command to see if your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted reside / dev / sdc & dollar; parted reside / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of reiserfs if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task is easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you shouldn't use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard that should replace GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as an image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages high-quality images, but requires very large files.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG has been developed based on the TIFF / EP format and committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers have already made DNG available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a coding technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive your recording, mostly in raw format, mostly in raw format. XMP does this because it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include architecture and modeling, discussions, and community work in the DCMI communities, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve widespread acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images on the camera edium are, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="246">For a fine editing, you can use external programs. if you re-edit the images with & digicode, then you should add the metadata again, which may be truncated from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. only then export them to web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & editing; in the addition of a photo to an album, you will find a description of how to add photos you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your alb database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digicode; to use, connect these to the computer, switch the camera to the display mode and turn it on. another description of this can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When the connection is made, a ferent indicator appears at the bottom and thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for each file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the page trim features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information that is internally stored by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata dialog displays internal metadata such as exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. of the image. this information is the same as with the Metadata page strip from the main window of & editing; or image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos from their camera into a single album in & digikam;. while downloading, the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only the desired ones with the standard selection methods of & kde; once you have selected the photos, use the button Download and then download selected. the button Selected is downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New downloadable. these images have not been downloaded from & edited until now. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, of course only the new pictures will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you are using the All Download or Selected buttons, a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in the section My Albums. then select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After you have selected the target album, press OK, and digicode; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all at once, using the Delete All button. if you only want to delete some, you have to select it first and then delete the selected deleted.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. you should check carefully if the photos were successfully downloaded in a & digicode; they should be checked carefully before you delete them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera bug completely, you should do so by using the camera menu, because this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use meaningful names for the photos. the file names are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can lead to duplicate filenames in case you load photos of different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section, you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for date-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two relate the data about the author in the section Standard Autoridentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the exif information are copied to the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you want a different date format than the standard format, e.g. in the editing field, you can use the prefix photo-% Y% H% H:% M:% S. turn on the Date & Time option. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the option Camera filename, you can change the file name in lowercase letters when downloading. or in uppercase, if you prefer this.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & digicode; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">Not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">Automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, & digicode; the photo in original orientation. if you want to turn off automatic rotation, use the Advanced tab and select the Automatic rotation at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date on which the photo was taken, & digikam; this use to automatically create subalbums in the target album. all images with the same date will be loaded into the same subalbum.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually switched off, and in this case, & digikam; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the Date-based submites option at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to upload photos from your computer to your camera is the download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the selection is completed, ask & digicode; see where the images are to be uploaded. select the folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in longitude and latitude and can be displayed on a map. determination of the data can be carried out by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you have forgotten where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser which shows the area with a click. if you want to send a postcard to another & digicode; users wishing to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how do the GPS data enter the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, semitrailings and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. right with the right hardware, via post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module to the geographical allocation (manual) and last about manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera integrated into a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as card module or by transferring data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading of GPS data from one device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you need to save this data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the geographical mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can do the same on & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the latitude and latitude, or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of hazy coordinates, which are created e.g. by maps.google.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European maps. here are some European pages, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">The editing dialog is divided into eight pages. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these by clicking on the icons on the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or edit image editing. you set the default behavior of & digikam; determine if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface.</seg>
<seg id="286">This field should be used as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. as this is a more detailed description of the car field, it must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the name that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be entered here since they offer the picture to other & quot;. if the picture is a bearing photograph, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC-actions store the data into the corresponding IPTC rims. this means that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only available in the & digicode database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be edited in & edited; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image tags as embedded captions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the images.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; Digit; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The option & quot; If you then open the beam, these settings are not available. the option & quot; you should use only on fast computers. if you have one, then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the shown photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can switch off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this viewing mode with F10 and F11 can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more details.</seg>
<seg id="297">Using png compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast computer, you can set this value to a high compression ratio.</seg>
<seg id="298">You can use the TIFF file option to compress the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of TIFF images. it does not affect image quality since the delate algorithm works lossfree.</seg>
<seg id="299">With lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossfree. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & editing, the image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog, you can change the settings of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">If you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option draws the image slightly soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the Automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is based on a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed pictures in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras, this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed lights, so the parts of your images that are burned down, due to the inability of your camera to catch the pointed lights, as a continuous white view. the setting colors release creates some unusual results as they display the pointed lights in various rose tones. finally, you can try to construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as quickly as green and red. and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the reconstruct option, you will get the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be adapted for each image individually.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably need to set it slightly higher than standard 1. however, this can also be done later in the editing options of the & digikam; image processing. to keep the time for the demos icing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital imaging process to calculate a complete image from the part raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor, which has many cameras and which provides a matrix colored pixel. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color reconstruction.</seg>
<seg id="310">As if AHD Interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenesis-Directed) produces the quality for me and the paper I used. VNG interpolation (variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. it produces color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you are familiar with the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for grading correction, as it is done during the shell conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions on how to restore them. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information such as color information from a color space in the others are to be translated to make the colors as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Please attach the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC in which you store all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of the ICC profiles you have here the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be deposited. everything can be changed when the raw file is opened.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">Not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like Canon, which do not contain any color tonmapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct for conversions at 16 bit depth. this means you need to do the color mapping yourself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft-Proof profile, with which you can emulate how your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print an image, because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors therefore can act very saturated.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras, it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for. unfortunately, not for Canon models. so here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extention lets you see the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; image Plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a range of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and these will then be loaded by & digikam. these modules appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can set short commands in the Settings menu.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The controls of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the transitions, normally 4-5 seconds are good. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom end of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection that tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in the image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you select a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera box.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicode; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, place it in the display mode and turn it on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check, if & digicode; the camera detects automatically. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. it is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you own more than one camera, you can paste it all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; Images in the trash stores, you can display the conversation between & editing; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections deleting a photo and deleting an album, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right sidebar can be tacitly handled by & digikam; if you use the option changes in the right sidebar without reviewing. otherwise, you will need to apply changes to the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display & digicode welcome screen; stop when starting. this speeds up the editing & editing process under certain circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="334">When something was deleted from the base folder, search & digikam; you know if it is to delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be edited in & edited; you can select the main window to suit your taste. you can select these settings from the toolbar under Settings. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in plain text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & editing, you will find further information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">You can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button to preview an image or through the context menu of the preview and selecting the entry ad / edit entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of these are available as modules in & editing; so you may not be part of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the file name, current filename, enlarging factor and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and among them the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing change your photos. however, none of the features will change the original photo before using the Save or button Save button from the toolbar. note that you can't recover the original photo once you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly create a copy of your image before changing it. this can be done with file save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using the Restore menu from the File menu or using the Restoring button again in the toolbar. you will then lose any change you have taken on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Almost every action of the image editing can be reversed or restored. you can undo the last action by modifying undo or restoring it by selecting Edit Retaining from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z for undo and remember Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the return or restore button in the toolbar for a moment longer, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out where you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select magnifying factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you enter the normal view where you use the Esc key. normally, the toolbar is displayed. if you do not want this, you can change it in the editing dialog.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select File Print in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu, you can print individual images or whole sentences. you only have to select the images using the standard methods and select print assistant from the Album Exports menu. if you follow the wizard, you only need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same page strip is available without the navigation arrows, also in image processing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple clicks on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the edge.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to EXIF- and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the labels will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this, you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this is always done when you have selected a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating schema of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select them and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field of Urgency. the code follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The sample view shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a box with the keywords previously used in this & digicode session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can limit the number of options in search of a keyword fast. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom end is a further relief when entering keywords in a picture series. if you typed different keywords, they will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate checkboxes in the tree. keywords of an image are keyword in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the section Keyword Filters.</seg>
<seg id="366">The page strip stitch filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more stub filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also draw and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply pull it out of the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears which asks you whether you want to set the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on one calendar day. the keyword filter is set to No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword tree was selected and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at every start of the program. it can also be disabled under Settings Miscellaneous.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or two, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, key word, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, specify an advanced search for all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why didn't Picasaweb or Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1GB and you won't want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly edited it and adapted it to specific implementation.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that your camera or scanner are using have a predictable deviation from the actual photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors you print or publish on the web to those of your digital dark chamber.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point in the image processing workflows. additionally, links with deeper information allow you to make your own informed decisions so you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, then you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture editions are by e-mail or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and life is so easy for everyone, why should one use another color space and have to think about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to kalliate my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in sRGB colour space or not, you need to kallibrate your monitor, as sRGB then runs the circle. if you work as a color space of sRGB, you either need to kallibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can enhance a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions normalize, compare, Automatic merge and contrast extend from the menu Correction Automatic correction try to automatically make the best of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best with your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the wavelengths over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest spot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balancing: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity canal gets as flat as possible. sometimes the same produces very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation, which either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic balancing: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it identifies the dark and bright border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram segment.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the largest possible area and a reorientation of all values in between. this is only visible with selected images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool for carrying out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space is worked with 8-bit per color. so if you are too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm that is copyrighted by Pawel T. Jochym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target photo has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is shown as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">At the top right there is a histogram showing that dynamic changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. shadow alignment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the controls above, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the color temperature selected for calculating the colour temperature of the white balance. this way the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the Preferences list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator raises the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will see the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"" "the" "" "Save As and Load" "" "buttons do exactly this. any setting of the white balance you have set allows you to store it in a text file and load it later." ""</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences knob restores all filter values back to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is available only for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tonmapping can be done through the underwindow for the brightness. detailed instructions for using color profiles can consult the chapter on color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find color correction in the menu. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to store multiple color channels. this is useful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation, that you can find in color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The color effects are available for four colour effects, a solar energy effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a filter filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created when using a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and then completing the development of the image. this had the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at approx. 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another upliftment produces a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar energy effect. the original image is the (1) and the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from saturation because it has a stronger contrast-effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. simply try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia's name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual to correct the color contrast and the intensity of the photos. you can experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too great saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mold Gradation and the Simple Leuchthickness / Contrast / Gamma, the tool tonal correction is located to improve exposure. even if the dialog for this tool is very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here. more specific the three slides below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three slides are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn is to move the knob and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">The original and preview of the image can be viewed on the right. the preview is dynamic, updated based on the settings of the image. the following options are available on the left-hand side.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box can be adjusted, whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is often dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top one for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle sounds, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three colour pinpettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input of shadows, middle and bright tones. furthermore, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Exit values: the output values allow selecting manual values for each area. there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output rate interactively as in the input rate. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a faded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatically: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. for this purpose, the Gimp Levels format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input is automatically readjusted for all shadows, means and sun shades. select the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the entry of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposed Indicator option controls all color channels to see overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left hand side, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most useful. for images with large areas of a constant color, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode continues.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright tones, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos a red marker is visible. if you shift this marker to the area you want to change, a suitable line appears on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you have created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp cornering format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun shades. turn on the color pipette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposed Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if detected in more than one channel, you will see the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black-and-white photo that was corrected in the luminance canal. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The editing & editing channel blender; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer for image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first note how to correct the canals by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left part of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as a comparison over one's rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The target image preview has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you enable luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as well, as the channel mixer is then THE tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix mono-rom, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the farthest. farcions consist of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns appear differently in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the colour space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load it. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposed Indicator option controls all color channels to see overexposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, that means you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image is under (1) and the edited picture below (2) to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step as color images can easily be converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lentil filter. this looks good with all scene pictures and fits particularly well with portraits against the sky. so similar to the 004 Cokine (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lentil filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokine (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at daytime. so similar to the 003 Cokine (tm) red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lentil filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm bright and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold to the shading floors. this is very similar to the process of leaking a pressure and re-development in a sepiate oner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokine (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digging tool; apply tool texture to apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="460">The original image is (1) and the changed under (2) to be seen. the relief parameter has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & editing came; adding tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task. one way of keeping his attention is to put the picture into a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your image. the picture with a colored line surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame. ideal for a knock effect and decorative adding an ornamental frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for the print of the pictures, especially if you have used the tool Following the aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this convenient tool, you can insert simple a formatted text into a picture in any place. this also goes in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. just enter the text and place it with the mouse. you will need to adjust the font size of the image size and the character set with its properties as you need.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any settings you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it cannot be changed anymore.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digikam; tool template you can apply a template about a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button of the base folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you copied the template files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for templates, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. the selection of a folder updates the preview toolbar automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons under the preview with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Smaller: this button shrinks the image below. it is centred around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the picture below the template. take the picture and place it on the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicode; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but creates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric mist and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitalized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is due to the fact that the digitization process has to combine colors with minimal differences to one color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when ink points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more afterward sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, internal sharpening is often applied. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpness index. this can be done with the menu entry Conduct Scoring.</seg>
<seg id="487">However, you should be careful with this because the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but reinforces the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen one image the tool refocus. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft character with the menu entry Conducting Vistula and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The Filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove slime from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter using the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or amount intensifies the effect. if you make the blur mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates are generated near sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. you should therefore sharpen images best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the wiped image which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus one can define a minimum difference thus for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore plastic errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the fuzzy masking filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). blurred masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The editing tool refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted design filter algorithm from Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to image an image & quot; refocusing quot; in which it is reversing the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocusing usually achieves better results than blurred.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß's fold. the Gauß's fold has a very long tail, which leads to the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's fold is even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should yield 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will still further blur the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">This is the most commonly caused by a previously executed blur. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circle-shaped sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The stores as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any more refocusing parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before changing the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but leave some unpleasant artefacts later.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, vaginitis masks better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp masking a larger neighborhood used as a focus.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masks always have to produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never show the effect of blurring. for the Vienna filter, it is possible to show that it is the optimal ruler filter.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the sharpness correction methods in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">"" "the slider" "" "Glätte" "" "sets the blur of the range that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil." ""</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinting allows an adapted color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove undesirable artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different default settings as starting points to simplify the restoration process. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. whereas larger values are mainly homogenous regions smooth and detail sharp. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction Addiction Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value close to 1 is flattened only in one direction. if you have a film graining or CCD is a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artifacts are best fixed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. so set this value to match the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is passed. usually, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle-width da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the more quality you get by choosing this option is minimal. it doubles the runtime. therefore, we recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">"" "the" "" "Save As and Load" "" "buttons do exactly this. correct any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later." ""</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation using the Cancellation button at any time.</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is used on a photo that was taken in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a unique black artifact in the background that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">Noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screen shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow advanced settings can stay with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor bugs fixed.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch that the filter looks forward to detect luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or smiging occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend changing either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more prone to smoke. however, it also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of phase jitter shock absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations in luminance. if it is raised, the edges appear smoother if it is too high.</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this. all parameters of the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use this tool to soften the soft character with the menu entry Conducting Vistula and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">Editing & editing; photo restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: JPEG compression is not perfect, in some areas even very far away. as a lossy compression algorithm, it generates some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "the" "" "Save As and Load" "" "buttons do exactly this. each setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and recharged." ""</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beverage.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera is taken on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected under (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photo, which was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts that were caused by the scanner's lighting and the photo paper. the original image is below (1) to see and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">It uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, tote or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; bright Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtracting method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important that you record the dark image directly after connecting to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD failures.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the appropriate dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview help correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview areas.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to see the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all Pixels have a distance from 1 pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a faulty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is shown below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">Editing & editing; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often uniformly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the edges and edges of the image by lowering the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor 1,5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blur effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and color and grey scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a clowfilter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was made without this filter.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controls, you can control the Vignetting correction filter and with three further exposures to the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Leukstrength, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting corrector reduces the luminosity of the pixel. you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. you only have positive values available, since you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer adjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the Vignetting correction on one image. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a leukemia and contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">Editing & editing; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect, but is flattened at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the distortion of the second degree distortion. with negative values, tone-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion grid. this value is stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter has the reverse accidentals of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus corrects the first grading. negative values increase while positive the image becomes smaller.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the preview dialog illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The pitch or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes. best perform this correction as the first. if you want to recut a picture and then perform a barrel-shaped correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correcting, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal support line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the seabed or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the tone / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them with the cutting tool in the transformers menu, cut from image processing or via the Zoom slider to this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motives, e.g. photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective in such a way that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have a slight distortion of perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonal correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is under (1) and the corrected image below (2) to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the GimpGuru.org website which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window, you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of the film and film sensitivity (ISO). if you want to simulate the grained texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO controller alters the amount of film granulture and the dominance of green color (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter blends color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">This is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silverns of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets rid of a timeless atmosphere from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, streetphotographic, granular sight specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">With the controller, the ISO-sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can use the filter more than once.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digits; Filter Oil Painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & editing came; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and style life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the processing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel screen is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients vary slowly are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sketch you. these would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pen size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The engraving shows your image in 3-D, as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">It works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important thing about the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, mondaring landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">Depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraver filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is viewed through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the scales 1, the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Beverage.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group, you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: wipes out the image along star shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: wipes the image by turning the pixel around a center. this simulates the blur of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Rangeblr: wipes the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to appear back in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blur: wipes the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blur of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking pictures, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Soft signage: blurs the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shatter blurring: wipes the image by random shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blur of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the coloured basins in the picture and blurs them without altering the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button Beverage.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this makes it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses one of Pieter Voloshyn's copyrighted algorithm.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows changing the size of drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can hold with editing; image processing a range free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter regentroping, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited pic (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. you can find the tools in the transformers menu, transforming or transforming mirrors.</seg>
<seg id="629">Conceiving photo is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how to reinvent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select transforming size in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">The tool for size change uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo-blowing was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Retain the aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be maintained when the new size is entered.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">"" "the" "" "Save As and Load" "" "buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each stallotment for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded later." ""</seg>
<seg id="638">Taking a photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a very long time and load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Beverage.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo blowing by enlarging a small color image on the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of Linear Standard Augmentation compared.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you need to use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and pulling the rectangle, create. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut away. this will give you a good overview of how your photo will look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is trimmed (Ctrl; + X).</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by dragging the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the lateral aspect of the width is assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">This means that it is always the same regardless of whether you are using centimeters, inches, or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photographic paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so the EXIF data will reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the assembly help make it possible to hide aids so that you can put together your pictures better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious Triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-angels, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles aligned on the diagonals.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden centre: the golden centre is a division that on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaf leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden splitting is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden splitting at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number is equal to the sum of its two preceding figures.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides more fluid relief lines when assembling a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you good results for your goal to achieve your goal. compared to the third angel, the golden spiral produces a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze upwards along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye can be in the center of the composition.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the gold spirals discussed above. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equivalent triangles. diagonals to place these lines can make a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break down your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your picture focus at one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and vertical mirror options can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture of many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image around any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it happens easily that you do not vertically or horizontally hold the camera. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the & digikam; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose Transforming Free rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences button you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is displayed on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in the previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming cropping from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to crop the image is the Automatically cutting function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The anti-aliasing option smoothes the image slightly after turning. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out at a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. preview will be automatically recharged. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty spaces created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner left corner: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle to the left below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right below: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is smeared a little. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double the strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you adapted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformers cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The scoring tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite. a horizontal pattern, for example, will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left.</seg>
<seg id="679">Rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can shift horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angles will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image will be displayed on the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the locking tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the scaling, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single scaling, this effect is usually negligible, but two chincings produce twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After scaling, the image has triangular holes in the corners. a way to remove them is to cut the image with transforming cropping from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">The available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries were compiled. in most distributions, you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="684">Because of this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF below.</seg>
<seg id="685">This happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of those with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, editing & editing is displayed. you can change this list of file extensions that & editing; accept. in the Configuration section, you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras allow you to select even the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images. this reduces redundant information in order to store the image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG with the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also save lossfree if this is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, see Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF using the & digicode's raw image converter.</seg>
<seg id="690">Digicode; support loading raw images only with the dcraw program, which is available in & digikam. with this, more than 200 raw file formats are supported. all support cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave coffee's web page. the table below shows a short list of raw data formats supported by & digikam;</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. these clips are often stored in AVI- or MPEG format. & digikam; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built-in options to view or edit movies.</seg>
<seg id="692">Go forward to the previously visited album in the Chronicle. you can only go forward if you have gone back before.</seg>

<seg id="699">If you change steps 4 and 5, which you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good, then you can perform the first four adjustments with the White Balance Module.</seg>
<seg id="700">Many tools you need to edit photo editing are in & digicode; their description follows here.</seg>
<seg id="701">All image processing tools such as sharpening, soft marks, noise suppression, refocusing, unsharp mask, & etc;. use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image. below you see & quot; texture Applicquot; in this dialog:</seg>
<seg id="702">(1): this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image. to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area. these modes are:</seg>
<seg id="703">Vertical parts without duplicates. the left part shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the right of the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="704">Horizontally split without duplicates. the upper part shows the original and the bottom shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area.</seg>
<seg id="705">The left part shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="706">Divide horizontally. the upper part shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter.</seg>
<seg id="707">'mouse over 'style: shows the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area and otherwise the original.</seg>
<seg id="708">(2): there are two buttons that you can switch on to display over and under exposure. the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page.</seg>
<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview. preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The properties tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo features: displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo. these data are from the EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble Miniprogram. you can drag the mouse wheel in or out or hold it and move it. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and to select and naming colors.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graph are used in science, especially in computer science. previously there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs, which & graphviz; includes, are according to the program author obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & keboviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the features of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kmviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; -digits; the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kseviewer; displays graph with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the sane project or another source, such as Video Streams. for this to work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu entry image scanning a dialog box that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to fetch the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will appear by using the default ducrhe option to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to suit your needs before you scan the image with the Scannen button. the estimated filesize will be displayed in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed as some settings may not otherwise be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After you have pressed the scan button you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to set the options of the target image appears. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and hence very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screen shots after selecting the screen shot in the Importieren - &gt; screen shot. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photo modes:</seg>

<seg id="797">The module Exports to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you are guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so it is your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful login, the module can send photos to Flickr website. you will be presented with the following page after a successful login.</seg>
<seg id="800">Just close the browser window and return to the program. after you have clicked on Yes, you will get the dialog for upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr is started two times, you will be greeted with the following dialog, which displays the current access rights that the module displays. at present, you will need write permissions. the module currently supports no other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be clicked once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the image's metadata. geographic data is stored in the EXIF s of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI module for geographic localization provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographic data, you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to make a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a trace file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same time in the same locations as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">When the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed that shows the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera time must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation is a top deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from a place for pictures you can edit the gpx file manually and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolating and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button Correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be manually set with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location. as the dialog shows the coordinates from one call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed map. select the region and increase sie.Guide this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the map can be switched between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to hang the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of images with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery of HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The Rider selection allows you to select all the albums that want to be exported to HTML. the albums are not shown hierarchically. with the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab Appearance defines the overall look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self explanatory. if you then click on a picture, a new page will be created in which the picture is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The Rider Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder where you write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be stored in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, this also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The Rider Forschaubilder allows you to adjust some of the settings from the album Reiter for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window is not automatically closed. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations like turning, zooming or shifting. the viewer can be used with short commands and buttons. it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossless module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the below actions without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of lossless storage is that the file size increases because no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found, for example, in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI module digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team under kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module Metadata Editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. then select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then go to the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but do not write in any target format. JPEG is supported when writing. please look exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the packages MjpegTools and ImageMagick. between the individual images you can add a basic image transition. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of slide au.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can choose a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that are packed into the MPEG Encoder. after that, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Enashau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change the pictures or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from different formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step, you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high, very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the mpeg-output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, this will be integrated into the movie. after adjusting all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the Code. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now quickly or in all rest enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that coders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages using the settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper along with standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the Gimp image processing. this is e.g. useful to improve or print the Gimp module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: do not expect the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and start the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines if camera settings are to be used for white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue enhancers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG-conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG-switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">As soon as you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion outcome. the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">Tagged image format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later on, you should not choose the JPEG format because there is only a limited number of operations allowed before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the EXIF information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. so use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, they have the ability to automatically overwrite existing files. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in one album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or increase the image. for this purpose four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option for example to adjust your picture to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Print preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be used.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will be displayed with the pictures you preselected. add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image you will see a preview on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag pictures to the list of images and to add them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you only need to add the addresses and the subject here. the images you selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have restrictions on the size of sending emails. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The E-Mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is stored and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you use the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments to the images are added to a text file and sent to the email.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image file format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend you the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG images in JPEG format and the original files are in JPEG format, the original images will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window is not automatically closed so you can view the status messages in search of errors. your e-mail program is started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the Advanced Diashau module, a window will appear with questions like you want to have displayed your slide show. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-Transitions option in the presentation uses very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner of the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">"" "the" "" "loop" "" "option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually set it down manually with Esc." ""</seg>
<seg id="889">The option to select images randomly ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not the order of the pictures used in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the images can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds are 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect.</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select. randomly selects a different effect at any transition between the images.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar on the upper left side of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slide.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>

<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set an image as background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module uses the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can browse through these browsers, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, there are now entries in each group, in people, places and in the group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you will see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with annotations. additionally, there are entries to look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current preview images.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you press the mouse on the entry people, the view of the browser changes. see Figure.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person only the images displayed on which both persons are visible. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single images.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images in your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture, each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person to save his own preview image, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To display images next to the names, select the button that is located on the right of the toolbar. in the pop-up context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display, for example, symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have appropriate images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual. in order to do this, you will need to select the image preview window (as described in more detail) and select the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can adjust the magnifying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the search in the main window, a dialog is displayed that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once more.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the label or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window, you can search all pictures by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here you can see pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the website of & kphotoalbum; and have a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; -demo. after that some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of PhotoAlbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a contiguous HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar displays you data statistics on the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then shows a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed items preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date is displayed in the preview pane) and the timeline displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will see only pictures of this time period in the preview view. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a timeline bar.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides two ways to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other is available as a module (see). in the following section of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum is described.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some adjustments. these are divided into the three sections Content, Layout and Objective. in the following, each section is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML example pages see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select whether a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created that is visible on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Last but not least, you can choose which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid the information displayed to the viewer without a description. note that all images are of a party. note that all pictures are exported.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section, you can specify how the HTML pages are supposed to look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">On the bottom of the page you can set up different resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no more images that have, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you set. so it can search your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">It is best to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to select the location for all future pictures. here you can either select a folder or a supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages are created will be started. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files you have created are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. so that the import function, see, works correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings that are just described have all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time applying the picture information, people on the pictures, location, etc., then you have to go with & kphotoalbum; do not make this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kin file. these can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or whether the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can share all the images and share this file as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can export a .kin file either directly from the Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kin file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have entered when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file by means of HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it will be internal or external .kin files. you will have the following three choices:</seg>
<seg id="938">On the option Manual in the proximity of the .kin file, you need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kin file copy & photoalbum; the pictures automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most of the images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is not normally worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">If you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be maximum 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Importing... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described.</seg>
<seg id="943">The assistant for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folder the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you personalize the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is named in your database. therefore, in the third dialog window you will be asked which categories of the imported file will be imported and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example of this can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and look at pictures: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump inside different picture groups & mdash; if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, over (2) browsing and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">PhotoAlbum was started as a program to manage your pictures, but it was expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual is talked about pictures, but often this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the index.xml file in the topmost folder of its images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, such as Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in the CVS repository.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder in which your pictures are stored and use it in future starts automatically. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. for example: photoalbum -c ~ / Company / Photo / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Through the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; setup... you get to a window with which you can change the settings of PhotoAlbum; in the following section of the user manual you will find the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left, you will see six different symbols that allow you to view the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available, which can be accessed by pressing a button on the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog that is used to process existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section below, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the dialog Options, you can set up full member groups, i.e., for example, to set up all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left side of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left side of the window is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; splits its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digicode and gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; image Plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called via the modules modules. they cannot and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules yourself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Because the modules of multiple applications are used together with each other, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum have been tested very little. therefore, you should always first test new modules with the demo database before you apply them to your own pictures & kphotoalbum Demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or through the Help menu.</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications using the KIPI modules are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums: this is an album just a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, so all images that show you the preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Besides the current album, we have to give the modules a list of albums. here is a photoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">When & kphotoalbum; s browser displays the contents of a category, for example, all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the preferences dialog as a category for virtual albums. so if you use the category people for example, & kphotoalbum; so do so if you would have selected people to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select the modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start & photoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top of the toolbar. at the moment, it does not contain too much information, as you do not have any information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to provide any picture with annotations. this includes information about the persons shown on the picture, where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you use the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by defining characters, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum, since you will always use them again if you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: if you have a family celebration, for example, and on all 50 images the same 5-10 people are shown, you can, thereby, that the names used are moved up, the persons find and classify faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer an alphabetically sorted list, click on the icon for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you might want to edit all the selected images and add them with annotations. in this case, simply click on the pictures before and back, which are located at the top right of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have received multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you will see a browser window displaying the USA as an overflow. to show you that it is an overflow, a special icon is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and place it in order to sort it to a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the Comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by drawing it outside the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the look of the window to your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options... which offers you, among other things, the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely fade out a frame. if you want to see this window again later, use the button Options... and hide / hide windows here. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the entry images in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or of all images if you have no filter set. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails, by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button, and just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set up as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the image viewer. if you haven't opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete pictures in the preview. simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and press either the delete button or select the Edit menu from the Edit menu. now you will see the window you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">You can use with & kphotoalbum; you can have saved the images somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can record the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you can see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not saved on the hard drive. however, for images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can also view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from folders and back into it. so, don't support it until now to ask for the recording of the CD concerned. so if you want to avoid hassle about how to avoid the mess of your images, please buy a larger disk to store all the images.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the images menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want a little more privacy, filter the images in such a way that at the end those remain that you wish to make for others inaccessible and click on Current View in the Privacy menu. alternatively, you can also control all the images that your little sister may see, control and lock the menu item everything except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have fixed which images are to be hidden in case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item pictures lock, thereby removing all the images you have locked. if you want to get the pictures displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply change password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure. for one, all images on the hard drive and on the other can read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only used to repel the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you want to describe all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them someday. for this reason, PhotoAlbum has a picture _ and video viewer. you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. of course it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can simply drag it and drop it somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all of these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">If you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have chosen people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several images to the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the Picture High and Image button. you can jump to the first and last image with trombone and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several pictures are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum, then load a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus respectively.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the beholder of & kphotoalbum; is to be able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the full screen on the screen. simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer, you can drag and zoom into the image. to zoom in, you can simply pull up a rectangle with the mouse. with the Minus button, you can pull out the zoom in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom-rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the item key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the key key the zoom puts, so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoomcooperations that work with videos that are in and out with the plus and Minukey.</seg>
<seg id="1003">You can turn on the picture with the rotation functions from the context menu. this does not work with videos. you can annotate comments on the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">When you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image. at the moment you can view the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer has the ability to provide images with features while viewing them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a characteristic by clicking on the corresponding letters. in the picture you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have put features on your images, they are available to you in the browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, simply add them all at once with annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview. if you can view categories in the preview view, you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the attribute after the image has been selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you can color photoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way, you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to turn on the painting mode of & kphotoalbum, select on the image from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; work, you must have the application of the program & Povray; not fully proficient, but the documentation to & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire module views.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the sub-object of an already selected object, as all sub-objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the toolbar or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed so that you can choose the right position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button can be used to remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click on user or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to the & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can view a preview of the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the tagged view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (e.g. a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag the control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the checkpoints disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wireframe view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a visibility step as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the point of view of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are displayed only if they are selected or their point of view is smaller or equal to the degree of visibility chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window setup, or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it as you like. you can also store multiple window orders and simply change between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below an existing view, drag the user to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then shows the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the user to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to superimpose several views on top of each other, drag the user in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking the map Leather on top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to save a view from anchoring, drag the anfasser to the desktop or click on the small arrow at the top pointing left arrow in the chambering bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfer strip. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for each type of views.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View window layout. it displays a dialog where you can store the window layout under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g to render, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 currently. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene click on the Rendering icon The icon Rendering in the toolbar or select the menu item view scene.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of the rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or select View Modi... the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it is a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box below and enter the image section to render into the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination with quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection illumination. a detailed description of render properties can be found in the user manual to & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">When a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, various errors can occur. these images often have a Moirè pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than one pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. in general, pictures with this feature look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling incorporates the neighboring pixel. the second method is adaptive, recursive, because each pixel is split up and down again and again because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 x 5 will be calculated with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">I would like to know more about abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel is divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are followed individually and checked for further subdivision.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you switch to Jittering, changed & Povray; the rays by a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card map you can set if the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have not hit any object.</seg>

<seg id="1065">You can set the object reception of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotation.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the ball, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high detail faithfulness for extended projections, all wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an advanced projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and the vertical projections. this feature gives a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>

<seg id="1072">Drop down selector window: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window layout when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created by adding the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name shows all views for the chosen window arrangement. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New Column, create a new column on the right side of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map view view together with the previous view and floats the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should consider these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, there are no rules for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't insert light sources, your entire scene lies in the dark and you get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error-free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing icons of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols now, so you should remember the menus and icons and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wile view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera are found. in the user documentation to & Povray; find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera has control points in the view that you can change the target of the camera. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">If you press the user button or touch button, the wile view and the object tree will change immediately according to these settings. as a result, you will see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the bottom for the scene. for example, you could insert a header (insert Endlicher Body Quader) and the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is an awkward method of resolving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler option. you can use an infinite level as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the plane in the object tree, change the name and press the user button or enter the button. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wile view now shows also the level, albeit at the moment only as a finite final layer. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the item for the floor when clicking on the symbol + in front of the object. in this case you will see only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line, just to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment choose something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In either case, a dialog opens, where you can select how to insert the object. the pigment will then be shown in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the preview button you will see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still need to enter settings for the pigment. therefore, always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see a color on the loader and the ball in the preview, just click the Apply button and then go to the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now correctly set. if you now render your picture with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree select each time monochrome and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already be able to do this step as you should have understood the fundamental way of working of & kpovmodeler; you should have understood the ball just as easily as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the input button or push the button), so the sphere has contact with the floor. otherwise, the sphere would float above the ground as you have shifted the ground around one unit down.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, the rendering now produces a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already on the floor, give the ball a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose first subobject and change the name for example in sphere Pigment. click on sphere Pigment, then select the color and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish characteristics:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The brightness effects and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces, even if metal: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options are available to you & kpovmodeler; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracing a scene, the renderer will shoot hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this beam is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog will impact.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is just black. obviously, every scene that should be rendered requires some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the standard file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file is inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and memory space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage have been discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">This menu entry allows you to select only if you have used the undo button.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window layout and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler;, here you can change the look, the shortcut and the default behavior.</seg>

<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic shapes are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by using an image file as a color card.</seg>

<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the generalization of amaroscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can hook it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde; & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>

Amarok is intelligent, sexy and chic - exactly the right thing to rediscover your music!</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok springs to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake don't have any difficulties when compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok, like most applications, has some options that can be activated or deactivated at compile time with the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compiling options, certain dependencies must be met so that they can be used. see the system requirements for details.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help in the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; can be set up without bother with the setup dialog. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the different functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">The Player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist. if the option is off, only the Playlist window is displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">When you save the playlist, save the current playlist automatically when you exit & Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist at the end of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths for manually saved playlists: if you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, otherwise the absolute position of the music files is saved.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep the current piece visible when changing the piece, causing the playlist window to roll up / down to keep the current piece always visible in the visible area of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing parts to the context browser, automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; the otherwise gray displayed section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window, and context browser. press select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>

<seg id="1224">The On-Screen-Display window allows you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is applied, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shadows causes the text to be shadowed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the possibility to adjust the OSD colors for writing and background. one click on the color faces opens the dialog for color selection. if Own colors are not activated, the default & kde colors are used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field shows the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders, the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users. this allows you to specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment should appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The card card audio output allows you to select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate further settings in this card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The Cartridge collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection. this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folder, which should search & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder into the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Recursively Browse subfolders: this causes & Amarok to search for music as well as their subfolders.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitoring changes: enables & Amarok to monitor the selected folder to changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pl- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will then appear in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup in the MySql subwindow is necessary.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (such as & zb; Linux). more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and otherwise no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed so (including the programs included in it, because & Amarok; requires some of them, for example, to find modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager keeps the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will work for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by typing in ~ / .kde / share / apps / amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the TagLib developer under bugs.kde.org and append the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time it is because taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this bug to the TagLib developer at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; compiled with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.X, this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable autom. disable if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the email opens automatically with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "The file $ARP [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARP [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $mp3 = MP3:: Mplib- &gt; new ($MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you receive this error: amaroapp: symbol lookup error: amaroapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd 'which amaroapp' _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove each conflicting Qt version or modify / etc / ld.so.conf to find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">There are several possibilities. most installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help with other users or developers. use the forum and the IRC under irc.freenode.net in the # Amarok channel.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for help. please enter there only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, only an empty playlist will appear. how will pieces of music be played there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left-hand side and open the desired folder. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To make the surface intuitive, the Start subwindow has been converted to the statistics window. you will find it under Extras statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars represent the rating by the user, while the points are automatically calculated.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To evaluate pieces, the evaluation column must be displayed in the playlist; click on the title bar of the playlist and select columns to view. you can also use the Windows + [1-5] shortcuts. this also works when Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, and then press Del on your keyboard. or right-click on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file into the playlist and drop it there, just as you would do with other files. it's as simple as that: -)</seg>

<seg id="1269">No. yes, this is true! no! & Amarok; uses one of the backend independent approach, so the real question must be what media types are supporting GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEmm?. as you can see, we support virtually any audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and PNG!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! maybe you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which in default no MP3 decoder will be supplied (for patent reasons). the solution: alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, input button</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously play audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (Software-Mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause of the problem and solve a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. ossally).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you just want to hear a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you want a decor with little overhead. GStreamer is reading the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. exactly like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes the data first. GStreamer can output directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open control center Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with highest possible priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">At KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEmultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this error report. to enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either you do not use the Arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use a different driver (the xine driver has been heavily optimized for analyzer), or decrease the size of the arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less dreamer the visualisations. yes, that's a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but when I want to switch to the Streamer driver, crashes and Amarok. why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer, you need to register all the components. follow the follow-up register to register all GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask in the IRC -channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (end Amarok before!): - Download mpeg, compile and install it. then execute the logs directory, once as system administrator and once as your normal user. then delete all the mpeg files in the module folder of GStreamer (you will find the module folder with the latest-config / GStreamer-config) and run logs. now start & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a versatile multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. like any normal multimedia player, & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions.</seg>
<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok are used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a scroll bar displaying the current piece or current stream. just below is the area, the playing time, bit rate and samplerate of the current piece. a click on this field changes the display of the already expired playing time to the remaining playing time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window provides a selection of audio analyzers, also under the context display. you can switch to the available analyzer by right-clicking on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current Analyzer will be displayed in an independent, extendable window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Under the running text display are also the PL and EQ buttons. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlist window, while the EQ button is used to set up equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the slider to set the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 default settings, from Klassik to Techno, and you can easily create your own default settings.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To display the equalizer, use extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist of all for & kde; available multimedia player. it has many features that there is in no other player. but don't be deterred by the abundance of functions, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The Playlist window can be divided into two main areas, on the left is the navigation area. in the navigation section you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays different information regarding the current piece. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows will be explained in detail later.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have previously used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may have noticed that the subwindow has dropped off. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be collected in the Statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to recreate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "under the" "" "Recommended" "" "pieces there are the favourite pieces of this artist. this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current artist." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information should be displayed in the music sub-window. right-click anywhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will work out and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the individual fields to begin playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok's collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The search button searches a search on google.com for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - groups only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are disregarded.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First, the pieces will be arranged according to the performer, and this will be the best view of your collection. if you want to see constellations or soundtrack-albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list among different interprets.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Interpret / Year - Album - Sorted by performer and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are alphabetically sorted among each other. the artist will be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre / Interpret - your pieces will be sorted first by genre and by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Artist / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the performer.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine the grouping as you like.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-register your collection as soon as you change anything at the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notes on the use of this filter can be found in the section for the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box, with which you can filter the last added pieces to your collection. you can choose from the last 24 hours up to a year. you can also select your complete collection, which allows the filter to be switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will lick up the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Append to playlists - Adds the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will get the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue position - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will be played next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you'll be asked for a name under which the list should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer to media player - Adds the pieces to the media player to transfer to the media player. for more details, see the section on the Media Player Browser.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this artist / Burn to CD - So the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or as an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for piece information and let the tags change for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(n) move files into dustbin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Mark as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears in different interprets.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Highlight the album - Change a record selected as a compilation album back to a normal album. after that, the album will no longer be shown under different performers but again under the corresponding artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The lower part of the playlist contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok's built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for running time. smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Intelligent Playlists to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The subwindow media player is used for connecting & Amarok; for example, to use your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, find the pieces on your iPod by performer listed in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list. when finished, click Apply. this will upload the pieces to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, quit & Amarok; and release the drive attachment for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">Among the toolbar there is a search area with which you can search for a file. search is especially useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files are hidden that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser, you will find an address bar with which you can fetch music from an entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz, you can access music from there to the Musictar.gz file. now you can drag the music from there to the playlist and drop it.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files by simply dropping can be difficult. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: by doing so, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not on the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">You can change the order by simply drag the entries to the desired place with the mouse. as soon as you enter letters there are only the pieces that contain the letters. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one of two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter between the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR 3. in this example, all pieces containing one or two or three are found (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enclose the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries by Mike Oldfield, but not according to entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can search for larger or smaller searches. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this searches for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield, or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment pool.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the order sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries in the desired order. entries will then receive a mark with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the window. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand side you will find the Add button to add the playlists to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"" "next, the buttons will follow" "" "undo" "" "and restore, so you can undo or restore changes to the playlist." ""</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar there is a unique, magnified analyzer. the refresher rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that which you can see in the player window on the right mouse button. you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration via this menu.</seg>
<seg id="1400">There are many more buttons available for the toolbar, for example, playback controls and volume control. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and set up toolbars...</seg>
<seg id="1401">The Status Bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total play time of each piece. furthermore, the status for shuffle mode and retrieval can be easily changed by clicking the mouse in the appropriate display area.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, deactivate the Status Bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking in the playlist on the menu. via this menu, you can reach the settings of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1404">Clicking on this entry will open the Visualization plugin window. there you can select the visualizations of & Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1405">Behind this entry there is a sub-menu with links to this document and other information about & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1406">The cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images. you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser.</seg>
<seg id="1407">The cover management includes a list view of all the albums in your collection. you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left hand side.</seg>
<seg id="1408">With the View menu, you can choose what is to be displayed in the cover management. select from:</seg>
<seg id="1409">The queue administration got your big move into & Amarok; 1.3. with this feature you have more control over the playlist. after you set a piece in the queue, a number will appear in the playlist, in which & Amarok; the pieces will play: 1 will be played first, 2 as second, and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1410">If you want to add a piece to the queue, select the item in the playlist and then click +. you can also easily add the pieces to the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist. you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management.</seg>
<seg id="1411">There are three types of dynamic playlists, two of which are already predefined (details to set up these are later).</seg>
<seg id="1412">Fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection, adding other random pieces while playing.</seg>
<seg id="1413">Adds pieces based on load .fm recommendations (earlier: Audioscrobbler). this mode requires some pieces in your playlist. you don't need a Last.fm profile to work with this dynamic playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1414">Double-click on the desired playlist, drag it to the playlist window, or right-click on it and then select Load. in this way, your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1415">The two pre-set Modi Random Mix and Playlists Mix immediately fill up your playlist and you can start playing directly. the playlist of Recommended Pieces starts with an empty playlist and you'll need to add at least one piece of your collection, so your playlist will be filled at the end of the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1416">If you want to keep the current playlist, then enable the last possible dynamic mode: settings Dynamic mode. this will use your existing playlist as a starting point.</seg>
<seg id="1417">The New Fill button cleaves the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode. edit playlists opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the settings.</seg>
<seg id="1418">When you click on a dynamic playlist, you have the option to click Edit. as a result, the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Enter any name for the playlist here. however, the name should be unique to avoid confusion.</seg>
<seg id="1420">If this setting is not active, your playlist will continue to grow, the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and no play will be heard in this playlist. however, if the setting is active, the pieces already played will be removed with regard to the pieces played.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Pieces played - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist, so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently.</seg>
<seg id="1422">This is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each play played. if you set more than 1 here, the playlist will continue to grow, because only one piece can be played and removed.</seg>
<seg id="1423">The right-hand settings have been described in the previous section. on the left side of the dialog, you can select from already existing playlists and smart playlists. if you want to cross multiple playlists, & Amarok will add random pieces from each of the selected playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Some scripts allow your own settings. you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click on set-up.</seg>

<seg id="1483">& k3b; is how many other & kde; applications are also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of the functionality can be controlled e.g. via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program, or the more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is key to which of the teach programs you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line. to use the & DCOP features, you need to make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Next to the general & DCOP; functions which all & kde; program have in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatdvd and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>

<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method, you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString) void addurls (KURL:: list urls, QString contributor) void speciameItem (QString) void renameItem (Qstring path, QString newName) void set VolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script generates a data project, several folders, and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo / foo / bar</seg>

<seg id="1496">First, the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is used by & kAudioCreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must now be done.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggable (for OGG) or other coders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to install something yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which coding / file format should be used? the Welcher Kodierer chapter gives a small introduction about encoder, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, use & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to bypass any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device avoids the protection, it is not possible to avoid the mechanism of copy protection. simply avoid the purchase of copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting must be done only once (the setup dialog can be invoked so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained. this leads (hopefully) to understand the lean approach of the user interface, over which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything being recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of commands from the main window. step by step, for example, you can find more information about how this program is used and screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if an encoder is configured in the Code settings tab in the setup dialog - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a submenu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read with a different encoder as the default. it should be noted that previously the encoder was configured in the coding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected for encoding instead of a full & CD; read out and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of messages (such as logs, beeps) for program events (such as reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog for & kAudioCreator; with different flashcards (such as encoder, to set the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoder and compression rates and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psychoacoustic model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but above this bit rate the differences become less important, since both coders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is delivered with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality at lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music should be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG plays is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256' = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a song. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate approximately 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of young people, portable devices and auto-stereos. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information which are manually entered or fetched by the program from freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kAudiocreator; and the coding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there are often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoder explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to keyword (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kAudiocreator must be added. the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button1 in the assistant):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what freedb is: a free database, in which people can read the audio CDs, the information to upload / enter, so that all others can download this information instead of entering the machine themselves. it is to be noted that only text is spoken here: & CD; Title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (the editor's note) am not lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from releasing information publicly on the & CD; and in addition, the information without the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music business can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; actively select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address than the one installed in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; set up to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually generated monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to store pieces from the & CD; to store in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and so the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed from the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined code. more information about the encoder is in the chapter catcher.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a code, you can get more information about the switch by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device designation of the & CD; / DVD disk, the write and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoder of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and use our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">There must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, since it is considered not entirely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can do of course.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd is made and that you have write rights on it (eg; trying to copy something into it with the Konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section deals with the basic set-up of & kAudioCreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD, which needs to be repeated for each & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we define the encoding of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we divide the program with the freedb to load the & CD; download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them at every reading of a & CD; if once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently, / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device designation of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here is not much to do. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example, everything is as loaded / entered as shown in the screen shot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information ask, so that you will be informed when details on creating keywords (tags) are missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb host.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be connected to the Internet to access the freedb server during reading the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second selection field is simpler, becomes a & CD; entry found, starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and file name is changed with konqueror &gt; rename and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode when you download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB big, think twice whether this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. mode is set up on the following card map.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data query, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server on the Internet. how does the system know which data the CD should be received? read the section on freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we didn't download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server nearby. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will function as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equally as far as the server is concerned, as many firewalls boggle the protocol 8880 by default, there may be more luck with the protocol 80, as the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example, we don't want to send any data to the freedb server. deactivate the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screen shot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of pieces at the same time: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; after reading the last piece, check this to check the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must specify the path / folder where the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in a private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be browsed to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme' defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a good audio quality setting, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. the resulting compression factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in the event of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of WAV files to be encoded at the same time: with a Dualcore or a quad or even a multiprocessor machine, you can try to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kAudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for every reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section describes how the process of reading the & CD; on disk runs. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, was written in the previous section as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb will need to be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD, which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look slightly different from those for a & CD; with success of freedb fetched data. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually, instead of fetching them from the Internet. comments will indicate the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; find this example. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, the & CD; in the drive defined in the main window, must be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screen shot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, consult the questions and answers section of the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window appears, and you can select the database entry that fits your mind best to your & CD; matches.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you do not select the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger it by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2-02: the CD editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the field 'Current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer has to be entered in the field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments inidividually per piece, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screen shot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. if all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment section. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least for what & kAudioCreator; maximum allowed.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also re-create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all coding or file formats. see the help file for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously matches the style of the outsource CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to freedb.org's website and read the information about the categories. pop or rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. just click on the line with the second slice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor will appear and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data that we have captured for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. enter the title of the piece in any case and other information you want.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the cover data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Caution: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album will be shown above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles marked in this way will be read out. make sure all pieces are selected, or press the button All pieces Select at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If the selection process starts by clicking on the selection of the selection process, this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what is going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab order to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is currently being read on the hard disk. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error when trying to work with a coder that you haven't installed yet. pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we typed in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The assignment # 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the encoding of Part 1 into the format MP3. this allows you to read and code in parallel. note the status message in the bottom part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program did not find a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out while another piece is coded and a third order is written in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is coded, a small window with a message is displayed for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kAudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions, however, already contain a pre-compiled package, as & kAudioCreator. install the package kdemultimedia from your distribution. if you read this, you probably already did it...</seg>

<seg id="1624">First, you can select... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialogue with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; drop windows into the & kmid; this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the play button in the toolbar, select the item play from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically as soon as you pull it onto the & kmid; (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">As soon as & kmid; a piece is played, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and using the slider back and forth.</seg>

<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the type of event is automatically calculated using a song so that you don't have to manually adjust it. so, if you select the automatic text selection in the Settings menu, the karaoke text will automatically be selected, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries of text events and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the 1 and 2 keys.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played in series. in this section you'll find how you can efficiently use collections.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find it in the menu collection under the item Organize.... Click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on Copy and selecting the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original ones.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the selected items in the collection manager.</seg>

<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When Automatically Adding to the Collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If Automatically add to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequences of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order as they have been added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list using the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the next song, the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To return a song back, select the Previous piece button, the entry Previous piece from the menu item or press the key arrow to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted, but it does not play a role as it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map contains general MIDI events in events which the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI Map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano events to the events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you only have a sound card, you do not need a MIDI Map because all sound cards are GM (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except for the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of the Keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compliant.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how General MIDI patches are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the identity sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all sounds that this instrument needs to play on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">If now a MIDI file should play a note with Patch 127 (gunshot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the note 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is the term Trommel-Patch of the patch, where each note represents another percussion instrument (drum, basins, maracas & etc;) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the always equal drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sound can be displayed on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple Keyboards for each channel and every instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keyboards are mainly used to map sounds on the percussions channel. see for example the included keywords.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 rows, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is shown on Channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions-channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-benefit events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-benefit event with the value n, this is converted to the n * (r / 4096) and then relayed only. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal commas are available).</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM suggests that a keyboard, which receives a pitch Bender event with the value 4096, should play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI Map, simply open the dialog MIDI Settings. you will find this in the Settings menu, Spot MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob will not light green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select Settings under the Single Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's home page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't feel like adding all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">OK, so support & kmid; drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; -windows.</seg>
<seg id="1688">Please activate the automatic addition to the collection beforehand. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default tempo, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; -Desktop a & konqueror; -windows with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a karaoke file), I have to change only into the & konqueror; -window and drag the desired file into the & kmid window.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly without adding it to a collection, turn off the automatic addition to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.E. first you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly those a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.5 and C.Das and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to continue programming.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card. it is not the same if you are using an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; using the MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL parameter. it then runs as if you had a sound card, except that you can of course not listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmarks menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are playing after each other, you should use the category Permanent Playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you have an entry, his group and all his subgroups are copied to the current category and playback will begin with the attached record.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & KMPlayer; not running. simply click on a name of a category, select View from the View menu and see the next edit mode. by clicking on a sub-group, only the XML contents of this part will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, it must be selected from the merge menu, selecting either the Edit Mode, or selecting another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost once the editing mode is left or another group will be selected without changing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Because of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files..</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and altering [General Options] No Intro = 0 obiger option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will follow the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation when starting does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying in the end animation, so the user can end the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the indication of one favorite photos: & lt; img dur = "n; img dur =" file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif "fit =" meet; & lt; / lt; / hegt; & lt; /;; /;; /;; In the directory tests / some examples of SMIL are supported by & KMPlayer;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab to configure MPlayer in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; here the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visible.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the & KMPlayer configuration dialog; everything must be configured by manually editing the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc file, just like setting up the backend per mimetype. here is an example like a flash using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even be played the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module must be specified as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The queror or & KMPlayer; can be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning loading the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order that a given back end is always taken for a specific mime type (of course only if this is determined), this must be done by manual changing the file ~ / .kde / share / kmplayerc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play cards using either MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog is to be used in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there, ports should be detected (e.g. PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb contained therein.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (presumably this type of playing of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also only supported on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the video forlinux extension must be functional for the XFree86 server. for the XFree86 server it must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of creation of this documentation, this is dvdnavsource, dvd source, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vrsource.</seg>

<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentmasterclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Start Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & Kile; selecting the wizard (menu) offers some options for creating the document. some settings can also be made to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this describes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], article (DIN) [scrbook], article (DIN) [scrbook], project author [beamer], slides [prosper] or user-defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this will set the character encoding. modern systems are increasingly using the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be used (for correct processing of & latex; documents).</seg>

<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry about this. it is merely a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - just like other source editor - the emphasis of the used commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate). by & Kile; if you see greenhy areas of a large text on the screen, it is with great probability that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file nevertheless.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the settings, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {instruction}) by & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line to the closing of the command (e.g.\\ end {order}). this function can be set in the menu settings box; set up... LaTeX commands to be deactivated.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document into the following elements (part is the highest and the sub-paragraph the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating your own & latex files. as soon as a DVI file (dependent file) is created, jumps and kicks; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer on the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI file contains a description of the formatted document and other information such as the font and is besides PDF the digital output art of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the back-up search, the elements of the DVI; file are skipped with the editor, and as soon as an element is clicked in the DVI; file, the exact opposite of it. once you clicked on a section in & latex; source text, the corresponding position is jumped in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. using a master document, working with others is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set to project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick-build: der & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (unless there are no errors in the source text).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file is based on transversesâ, and there is no call from & Okular; after quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the edit toolbar, you should notice the three large selection fields. the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first selection field is for quick insertion of the document into parts, chapters, sections,... The available & latex orders for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field for further items such as keywords, footnotes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a name for a section, a picture or a different element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a designated name (choose a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list is displayed with literary entries. for & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex, appropriate editors are necessary. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ rÃ ¶ e is used for defining the font size. it can define the font sizes for the main text, the notes, etc., the following font sizes are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the fonts. if fonts are not specified at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code has been entered, the & latex code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use menus for building or pushing the button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source must be saved before compiling. & Kile; it automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. if you use quick-build, & Okular, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have another font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} then authorize the change of fonts within the environment "(English Huge).</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes will only be cleared inside the environment (from\\ begin to environment} to\\ end {environment}. there is no reduction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the legibility and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold printing, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for italics and is valid until it is closed with\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be displayed italic with\\ emph {Word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ rate: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source code with the & latex recording language has been presented, a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile follows.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a little text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments for the better readability of the document should be performed. at least one quotation, a few places in bold and italic pressure and a poem can be used to see the differences between these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, editor View or Ctrl E can be converted back to the editor (with the internal viewer). with an external viewer, the window must be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file was created, the document can be printed out or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try it and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (English D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>

<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal upper / lowercase means that attributes are inserted in the way they are described in the tag XML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Automatically close the optional tags: if checked, tags, for which the closing tag is optional, will be inserted immediately after & gt; inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update Start and End Tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic creation of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes to identify different types of files. by using Standard Returns, default values can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Default character encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be bypassed). however, this setting here is stocked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD is not recognized. however, this setting here is stocked from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies on a regular basis so that the document can be recovered from this backup during a power failure or crash when the program starts. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and the documentation can be displayed either in the Editor area or in your own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default at the next start is useful when the user interface has been confused by modifying the MDI modes and docking / appending views. it corresponds to the --resetlayout command line parameters.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning message field is used to control the display of warning messages by means of hooks of no more.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change the behavior of & VPL; it can set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and the source view in shared mode. see the different modes see.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here, the parser and the structure tree, representing the figure of the parser nodes in the document, can be set in details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Settings section, the visibility of node in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are empty spaces in the text, while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means it can give a valid group for PHP where the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plug-ins are KPart applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, the best-known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plug-in if it is not located at a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin during startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "load component in" "" "Only-Only" "" "mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-Lese-Kparts usually refuse to load when this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is checked, test & quantaplus; if the submitted information is correct. select also if the plug-in is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely new. support for the no longer necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with selecting a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the button Options beside the debugger plugin selection field, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view in which all holding points, with line numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is displayed. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, all or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is produced, or it shares the plugin with to listen to debug requirements. this action is triggered by default if a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally you do not have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debuggen session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends a HTTP request to the server to initiate a Debug request. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start running the script and send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is started before a debug file is started, the script will start with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script without entering the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the directive and go to the next one as if it weren't the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or expression can be entered that is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog, a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale and this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a KPart of xsldbg that you can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many other works by Keith.</seg>
<seg id="1992">This chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can & quantaplus; help to get better.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Document type editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; they allow & quantaplus; capabilities such as car completion and node trees. their simplicity and flexibility makes & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two types, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folders and the toolbars. tag folders contain handy, symbolic buttons of image buttons (above the editing window), insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how tag XML files are to be created, then the & descriptionrc; and also toolbars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the Properties dialog, the & quantaplus. file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow quick insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they only contain the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folders carry the name of the description language and version, so present. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the tag XML elements and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information at work with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains as only element type about itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tags is a script function. when using it, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">Yes, the tag has an ordinary attribute group and attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags describing how to show this attribute, & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Specifies the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and the attribute tree.</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to reach source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name inside & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and a method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouping together the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each & lt; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specify the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog once (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specify a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements ending a tag. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files need to start with an & XML statement: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause leg break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is in the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not available. currently, the check only occurs when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">This file describes the & lt; scheme &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "& lt;? XML version =" "" "1.0" encoding "" "" encoding = "UTF-8" "" "? &gt; & lt; tag name =" "" "overload" "" "type =" "" "class _ name" "" "type =" "" "optional" "" "/ &gt; & lt; / tags &gt; tags &gt;" ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">The file descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for editing DTD settings via DTD. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created for a newly created & DTEP; should be created with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = verse 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with settings actions... are created. clicking on New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the User-defined button, a shortcut can be assigned; with Kone, the current key symbol can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) which change the document or use as input (or parts of the document), start. examples of & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various See in... actions for (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First, the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myHome / myscript t.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, such as: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts local scripting folder: $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replace the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be entered by & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined what to send to the default input. options are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected range of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">There are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages sent to the standard output. it can be specified, which should be done with the output written on the standard output, by setting the output field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the markup.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable dialog "Edit Tag" when available so that an input is possible when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol, that the action represents better, we & kiconedit; use. select from the & KMenu;, Graphics Show other programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22 pixels. to change this, select Edit Size to others.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol does not only help you remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a starting button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually set as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled, that clicking this symbol will start & lt; start.tag will insert in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still has to be connected with the action. this happens through the menu with settings actions choose... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the user button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want some common & quantaplus; add functions to the toolbar or it should be shared for a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the toolbar to set dialog about settings toolbars. make sure the toolbar you want is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the item that should be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator supports the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; -Button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by testing all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After new XML does not exist, it will be created inthe root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your file bar (s) to load (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation to the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. therefore, this chapter describes how to create a PHP documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search for an existing documentation for formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index top element = Section1.html Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.1.html Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = tag2.html session 2 = tag2.html session 3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in den & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is sub-folders in the tree with its own contents. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently displayed at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but pay attention to & & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would be displayed. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of context elements that should be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and save it to $HOME / .kde / share / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / doc for local and global use.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to use the & quantaplus; community. they will not be rich, but proud to have collaborated in the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by e-mail to friends, partners or otherwise. in different places there is an email-sending menu entry, such as DTD DTD package (DTEP) with e-mail, tool bar toolbar with e-mail, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. to make an active contribution, we recommend to sign the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. this ensures that the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private GPG key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can select one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled out (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start the upload.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), toolbar toolbar, and started in the context menu of files and folders in the Template and Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, investigated & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag XML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD load and conversion of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description that should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype Definitions line: the string that should appear in! doctype Tag, like HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / d3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of DTEP after conversion: when enabled, brings & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand them and to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize themselves with these fundamental concepts.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the work area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus..</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available to anyone who marks & quantaplus; everything that is selected as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure different toolbars, actions and patterns in the global tree available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements are a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that only this user can use it personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, making the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the card holders with information and the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as the current, other or all card frontrunners, reload, delete or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or run CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tag under the mouse-cursor, using the word under the mouse-cursor or opening the file, if the string is designated as a file under the mouse-cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new features and associated user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a tag, e.g. & lt; insert; insert into your document, then click on the icon that represents the tag. now, you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (like anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to & quantaplus; navigate, open and roam. in the presentation with file managers are available for files, projects, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus. this view shows all the files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as add, remove, upload or delete files from the storage media can be done with the contextual menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context in which they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. clicking with the left mouse button allows you to retrieve the available information to a script. with the right mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by right-clicking on an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. it can quickly change attributes and namespaces with it. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tab at the bottom of the window, can be accessed via the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about every script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the current document's markup. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; toolbars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate page of the toolbars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; send the toolbar as compressed Tar archive on & kmail; if you receive a toolbar in an email, you can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the site of & quantaplus; instead, autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and do not execute here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in PATH is located in front of its bin folder. same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup language editor would? well, this would make it the absolutely great web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer limited to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the appropriate & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & knot; developer community based. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of why develop what someone else has developed?</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost impossible.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>

<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and managed by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, and the oldest entry is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. look in the section on templates. should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">When inserting from the clipboard there are special characters to the & HTML; -description, so they are displayed correctly and are not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; -description, which is the correct way to paste special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to paste & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switch on or off the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very useful when your & PHP; script gives error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you see the display of scripting functions and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switching on and switching the problem-porter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to place bookmarks with a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor's position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear grouped in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with .webpry file extension.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files into your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">The list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and if you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project is managed. in Chapter & Quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbars. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this only creates the name. actions need to be added by means of settings... or you will be asked when you exit, whether you want to save the toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. it does not delete it from disk. if you haven't saved the toolbar still, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar is available in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the uploading of toolbars to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Download a & DTD; anyone who has made you or someone else and convert into the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be freshened, without renewing the whole & DTEP; if this is global and does not exist a write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard in the Tags menu, which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day preferences dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu followed by & DTD; -specific sub-menus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent inclusion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inclusion means that & quantaplus; inserting by means of toolbar denies that this day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plugin menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items above. click on them. click on an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlight mode for the current file. the list of available herding schemata depends on the type; -version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Select the type of line-end identifier. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms to develop. select Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching may sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics. recommended is the index card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. by selecting an entry, the appropriate subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the status bar on the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Specifies the behaviour of the editor window. in the documentation of posters; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you delete entries from the toolbars or add which and the sequences can change.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the context of the mouse pointer, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after filling the project name, the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed automatically. all these paths and author information fields can be subsequently set using Shift; F7 Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project to enter, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can find the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.nam.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a common collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows files from the local file system to be inserted into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. in server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Be checked if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be integrated. if a project is restarted from scratch, do not hook.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection according to your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hook or by removing the checkbox, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project Project Properties in the subwindow Profile or using Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to above, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read in more on project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the desired debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the debugger plugin can be set with the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the sub-window profiles uploading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as displaying a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by keeping its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can switch event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default opens & quantaplus; the last project that was open. you can't influence this behavior at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select project... from the menu project or the icon project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allow selecting a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is saved automatically. you'll be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there, the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behaved as well, but the opening and opening entries are missing... in the context menu with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows to remove the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button is dazzled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will remain in the core memory and forget about programs. this option is useful when frequently uploading files is needed and the rather insecure password on the disk - option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high load profiles can be created, so that the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a full-qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed except the network administrator does not run a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in one project, i.e. by simply sharing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted in the Project Toolbar menu or project toolbar, accessible via settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adjustment of & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are best customisable through the toolbar menu. use and Adding differ. adding toolbars is treated below in the Adding Toolbar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbars and icons can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbars can be removed, toolbars can be rename or toolbars can be executed, which can be displayed in the dialog, which actions on this or other toolbars should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the entries will also be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbars and the actions on them can set up Toolbars in the menu... and set settings actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essentially document skeletons, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus; templates are basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; supplied templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions set out at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using linkups (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples are usually found in the template tree with global templates. more information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be created from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specialized documents will be created in appropriate subfolders. you can find a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate manner to be efficient.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select Save As a template As a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, notice that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. see the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as pulling and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or in the project file, you can click a folder right and create site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates allow a very goal oriented approach. you can pretend headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert or link files with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files deposited in $KDEDIR / share / Quanta / .kde / .kde / .kde / share / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates / Quanta / templates.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection field with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is configured, then it would disable templates in this path, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, it is likely to be found in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and by copying contents templates to a folder with special headers / footers allows you to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you can use context menu (show right mouse button) about a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -editor and VPL; & Source editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; editor and the second partition the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP, a small green symbol indicates the default of & PHP; source. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editing & PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that the changes in both the source editor and the VPL; editor are visible at the same time and the cursor is active in the source code editor and in the VPL; this mode is already active, pressing the active cursor from one window to the other, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and source editor is adjustable using settings Quanta. when selecting VPL; View, you can choose between synchronisation after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">It is assumed that you want to change the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor is possible. the document Properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the manual coding.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pushing the two buttons down. clicking on the list allows to change the content, such as key words on the name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to look for pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rule is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS styling template by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor, by moving with the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves peculiarly. text can be inserted by typing and using button or distance key.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way through the toolbars, as in the source editor. it must be noted that the inserting of tags previously existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag, surrounded with text, every other surrounding anchor tag must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the Sheets Assistant or the Listen Assistant are disabled. you will later work in the & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists of toolbars must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for examining style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style template can be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To be able to compile successfully, you need besides & kde; still libraries libxslt, libexslt and LibXML, which are already present in a typical installation of & kde.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts during merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, many more useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the merging and merging of folders. this function turned & knu3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes. the original file (base) helps & kdiff3; the merge editor among the differences windows allows you to resolve conflicts and at the same time displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is similar to the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this feature.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if someone alters the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different files.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by simply writing the file name of the first file. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows you to manually type file names, choose from the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the drop-down list. you don't have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">By clicking on the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merging of folders will be initiated. however, if for A a file is selected, for B and C a folder, then used & kdiff3; the file name from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not necessarily necessary to specify an output file immediately. you can also do this later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setting button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only compare parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you first need to create two corresponding files, add them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently, you cannot extract anything from & kdiffusion; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and placing of text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data might be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible row in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed by the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, one can see the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that's good in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some programming languages, where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare isolated cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separates the abstraction column from the text will be interrupted at the places where the source file has no rows. if the line break is enabled, the line is dotted with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (below the comparison window) has also an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [edit] when you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons Springe to the next solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison window frames are used, every difference at the same time is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row is selected in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder for the case that you change your mind and perhaps return another source. this text appears neither in the final stored file, nor in a marking that you may perhaps copy and paste somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore the numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigating mainly to the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page ab, beginning, end, Ctrl beginning and Ctrl end, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auditions window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-below / Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to press the copying button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). if this is checked, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option, because you might accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a line feed character\, and Win32-based systems use jack-feed + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line-ends of the source files, therefore you should not use binary files.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and list of most recently used files will be saved automatically and restored at the next start. (menu settings - &gt; Configure KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic script. if the chosen script does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors may not be available in their pure form, but would be scanned. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically adjusts an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the indentation of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is enabled, each selection will automatically be copied to the clipboard. copying the manual to the clipboard is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line-end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">The second step compares each line. in this step white characters are not ignored. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging, white characters are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a line character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others only save a line feed '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the car return character, but then treated like a white mark. during merging, this option must be disabled. in default, this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. comments are treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before continuing to the next unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that automatic selection also concerns conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning folders and conducting a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and already an older version exists, the original version will be attached to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the currently running program. you need to quit & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is selected there globally via the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">In the coding fields for coding a short notice appears, what the local coding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the coding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding to be used to save.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option, you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">(note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options Ignore Numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments are enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available when you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences between two of three files are displayed. but sometimes you may only want to see the differences between two of three files.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply add the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for viewing long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you look at the differences and then decide immediately to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to reboot the merge, then the name of the last used output file is retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches exactly your requirements. you can use this function for example to cut out bothersome parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal preprocessing command was specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is needed, and most users do not want to program it themselves. good news is, however, that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processing command for line breaks to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all following the same pattern $keyword substituting $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for line intervals. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, i.e. virtually deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several substitutions at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the substitutions. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / REGEXP / replace / SCHALTER'However, perl requires some details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are maintained for viewing and merging. other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline pre-processor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and, in the worst case, destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit a lot of files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare & merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... perform selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify a folder on the command line or in the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not merging. to start merging, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details will follow)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed by a small message window about the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that were compared to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder shows & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - click, or double-click on the object or by clicking on the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions to fold all subdirectories and open all subdirectories with which you can open all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click on a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the clash action cannot be automatically chosen. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As seen in the picture above, the colours red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire content is identical. then folders also have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea to this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. when A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such bad objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. when A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such bad objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The Sync mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified and if the option directories are synchronized. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist, but not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B; copied directly after merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merge is selected, then investigated & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy. if the files are different but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not removed, merging the folder cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is processed by another. the status column shows Fertig once the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is ok everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If a Full analysis is selected in the setup dialog, KDiff3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, not white and white conflicts. (the resolved conflicts column is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or folder), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then you will use C as the target in the Three Folder merge mode, and B will be selected as the target in the two folders merge, and A and / or B will be used for synchronizing.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check if all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that might be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select folder merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the key shortcut). to only merge the current entry: select action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If invalid merge actions exist by conflicting file types, a message appears that indicates the defective element. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merging a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / continue / continue or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog will appear. then execute & kdiff3; continue your work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If you encounter a mistake, a message appears and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to check the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), select another action for the entry or solve the problem in another way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged together, remember & knu3; these entries (in the current session) and do not merge them together at the later compilation of all entries. even if the merge operation was skipped or not saved, these entries will be considered finished. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The & kdiff3 settings menu (Set Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called Folder merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the specified pattern will be displayed in the element tree. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid placeholder: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured specifically with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some filesystems, files have a default attribute. in other filesystems, a previous dot marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">When the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the links are treated as normal folders and searched recursively. (note that & kdiff3; not checked for possible recursions). a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders with a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the change date and file size. however, this speed advantage costs you a certain degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered to be identical if they are equal to size. this can be useful e.g. when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected in such a way that both folders are identical.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging, copying the newer file as an action is suggested. (this is considered unsafe because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been modified either.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another backup, the original version will be renamed and will receive the extension .orig. If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merging of single files, not just merging whole folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merging view keeps visible during merging single files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch the main window in the Windows menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You can also directly merge a single file directly without having to run the folder. as soon as you save the result, the status will be reset and the file will not be merged once you start folder merging.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost when you read the directory again: directory menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDiff3 uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open, located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax than local files and folders. a few things you should consider:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contained. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes because of the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. there is a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link shows a file or folder. then always a file is accepted as a link target. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modifying date. therefore, the permission or modifying date differs from the original. (please refer to the Confidential of the Size.) (This is only possible for local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDEVELOP, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDEVELOP from the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally you need & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as KPart, & kdiff3; then remove & kdiff3; the names of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Konqueror, you can click on a patch file and select Preview - KDiff3Part from the context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & knu3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now it's compact) already exist. furthermore, the name Kdiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff Tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or that they will go.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You have compiled the program from the sources and probably don't tell the configure script to KDE. in default, configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE cannot find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, then these lines are treated as identical; if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. if similar lines disappear to each other, this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. this is necessary to simply drag a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file, and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort has been too large so far. you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is rinsed; No src is left; it appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and miss the purpose. please use another editor for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all the features of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">For information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE, please visit the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiffusion 3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the ChangeLog file in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Da & kdiff3; autoconf and automake use if you have no problems with compiling. if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of this.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) insert the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replace the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the refresh function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging them. if the target folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present). if the lines are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. different characters (e.g. 'A' and 'a') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini-preview of all virtual worktops. it is quite practical to see the running programs on the working surfaces, change their size, quit them or move them. this works both within a desktop as well as in several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and on the other.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows within & Kpager can be moved; motion is possible both within a working area and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager to set up... and Beverage. if, however, on an application inside & Kpager; clicked, there will also be the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimizing, maximizing, On Desktop and Finish. the commands cause the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows within the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other workspaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is crossed, in & Kpager, the names of the virtual working areas are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field lets the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is enabled together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, eg; 1st Desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is enabled, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is enabled, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise, only empty workspaces will be displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. symbol shows the windows with their standard symbol and Pixar shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixar is recommended only for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically, & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as from pager applications appear in some other window managers; horizontally displays all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display windows as symbols or with their contents and move. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up switch settings... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently, this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / kpagerrc with any text editor like e.g. & kedit; or vi. if you don't have write permission for the file, you need to login as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the kdebase package, you need a functioning installation of the KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2480">This application is interesting for different users: these include artists, web designers and people with a visual impairment. this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of & Kmag.</seg>
<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded with new features. it is optimized for use on high performance machines.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you start & Kmag, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; displays the magnified area of the screen. in the following, this window is referred to as a magnifying window. the image displayed in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is described below as a selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">As an alternative you may want to display a selected screen area in the magnifying window (dropdown display mode) or the surroundings of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that the mouse pointer is currently not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard tab; / Qt; mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse pointer in the magnifying window and hold down the left mouse button, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifying window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, if you press the & Shift key or press the & MMB, you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">With this combination, you can change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window stays firm and only the lower right corner is moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">You can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the update of the display. stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the update rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the update rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection window is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>
<seg id="2493">& Kmag; automatically uses your set short commands for saving files, opening a new window, printing, reloading (with the button document reload in & konqueror;), Enlarge and Shrines & etc;.</seg>
<seg id="2494">Kmag also known as & kmagnifier; is a screen shot. you can use & kmagnifier; use an area of the screen to zoom as if you would use a magnifier in a newspaper or photo. this application is useful for different people: from research or artist to web designer or visual handicapped.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click when the mouse cursor stays in the same place for a while. it is intended to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (Repetitive-Strain-Panel-Syndrome) and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click when the mouse cursor stays in the same place for a while. it is intended to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this hasn't happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain that is caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic tools, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent shift enabled, makes & kmousetool; pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the move, before releasing the mouse button is executed. in this way, you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click brings out.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Positioning is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is enabled. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button, wait before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse is done in the meantime.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This move is stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strobos.txt, when it is started, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. go to Sound & Multimedia, choose Sound System and here the General tab. there's a slider sound buffer that you set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; Start & kde; Start. this function is currently only available under & kde; please consult the respective documentation for GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">All settings are reset to the settings that were set when the dialog is opened. if you have already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last press is pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the intelligent moving should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the intelligent shift.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of which areas a mouse click will remain without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window, which does not link, will not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use them again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse bucks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick here is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to pull out the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse varies. however, it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rolls. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. you can easily scrape the dirt and dirt with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent move in this case, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens if you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor wherever you want it. however, use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbars and menus and the titlebar of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the intelligent shift, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to highlight text, copy it to the clipboard and move it again or perform any other action where you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click at one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse pointer to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. this will always play when & kmousetool; the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when to move the move time when it is smart. later, you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool; to use, the XTest-extension for & X Window needs to be installed. that should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse cursor as soon as the mouse cursor leaves. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain to the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each job you send from the map sheet is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of lengthy texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are executed in queues, with the exception of the output of Screen Readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such reads, this output is stopped and finished.</seg>

<seg id="2633">With voice selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program, which has the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read the text of KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for a speech output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, the text will remain unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">If a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification is sent to & ktts; it is processed by all activated filters installed on the bottom. processing by the filter is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>

<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. once the issue of the screen readers has been read, the retained orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is important news as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders will resume after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that speaks news. if you & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can talk to & kmouth; nevertheless someone who enters the space.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, add & ktts; the audio output in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both the introductory sound and the introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the incoming message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSml) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains stamps for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. SSml is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSml only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You need to install the rab _ diphone voice (British male), since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the output of SSml.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the speed or pitch settings in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 nbsp;%, SSml text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and sets of punctuation filters (SDB filters). SBDs subdivide text into single sentences. this allows you to start reading or stop the first set, even if the voice synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the punctuation filter. at the first start of & ktts; it is automatically set up as default. you can change its settings or add other punctuation filters, but beginners will get away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn is to set up the language selection by selecting it. turn on the language selection and enter the text to read. switch on the language selection, change some properties and check how the speaker is selected. of course, you have to set up more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then faster to start reading, since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the regular set detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation filters compare text with a regular expression for bylaws and add a tabulator character (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tabs are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen reavers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal puncture recognition filter from default, you can paste it again by loading the standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>

<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property should take precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markings here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case that you may want to specify the attribute language is when you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field speaker, which is most likely to delete the following, click the standard speaker on the select button and then use the speaker that best matches the following.</seg>

<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crashed and & ktts; you probably need to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved by this, you may need to install a non-compatible version of GStreamer. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time. if I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; one. on the & console; a message appears which states: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system, there is the problem that conflicts in ALSA are occurring that prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. for possible solutions, please refer to the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>

<seg id="2752">The settings for speech speed are ignored if & ktts; & HTML; reads. (this is because HTML is transformed into SSml.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are quite bold, change the .xsl file of & HTML; -to-SSml-forming filter, and set up the speech speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read web pages with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; read the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">For Festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that festival doesn't produce any errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER-tags to convert SSml to Saber. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string replacement filter and now I can in & ktts; no longer pre- or go back. on the tab order it appears that the order consists only of one set. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">Punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon) are not allowed to be filtered out. use a filter for punctuation recognition instead.</seg>

<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages), when & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Installing the compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a & console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface tool such as a package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; instead, the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended only to experienced users. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information is given about basic networking technology; in the second section all of & knetworkconf is discussed; modifiable configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace any further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is communicated to a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to pass through in the near future. this description therefore focuses on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is to know which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, at & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the contact point where a valid IP address is running or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up an own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area dedicated to this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is set to 255.255.255.0, so that all the hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called default route, the second the loopback address (localhost = your own host). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The network address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to its own loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf; they are affected and where they are stored in the different distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if there is another content than specified in the case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is shuffled by the scripts in SuSE config. another stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which also provided the ability of dds2tar to fast, selective packing.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it needs to be connected by & kdat; it can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; clears the tape and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognizes and kdat; the pre-tensioning on the tape does not, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognize & kdat; the default, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the belt index is to be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the tape will change for the tape drive to indicate that the tape has been integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the volume of the tape can now be searched for the tape by folding the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before ejection of the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; notes by changing the symbol for the band to recognize that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a band can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive requires formatting before use, this must happen before you can be formatted before use. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After input of the band name and the capacity is running & kdat; with the format of the tape away. all data on the tape will be lost. once the formatting process is completed, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. only this file or folder will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Highlight files in the local file tree with a checkbox. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Glossary in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is initiated, the dialog opens. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog box will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a checkbox. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on one of the archives and select the menu entry...</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the checkout has been started, the dialog appears for verification. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the check-in settings, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the exam process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before initiating the restore, the files to be recovered must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive. only the selected file or subfolder will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a checkbox. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the recovery process has been started, the dialog will appear. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the job folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for recovery, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it is necessary to recreate the band index using the band content. this process deletes all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can set the following settings for a backup job:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current job folder in which the backup is to take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files in it will be backed up, located on the same file system as the folder. folders, which are located on other filesystems, can be stored separately in backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independent from the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before using tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons & gt; & lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">"" "the settings can be set up using the menu item" "" "KDat" ""... "in the Settings menu. you can set the following settings:" ""</seg>

<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is incorporated, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations can be done.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, try & kdat; lock the ejector in the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, the release of & kdat is automatically ejected; do not use this option in floppy-streamer.</seg>

<seg id="2935">If & kdat, a volume is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time in which the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file named in the $HOME / .kdat file / folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incremental backups.</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files. furthermore, & ksystemlog; experienced users can quickly access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions available, with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start & ksystemlog; first try to open the most important protocol file of the system - the system log. if this is not displayed, and it opens itself instead of a small message window, you have & ksystemlog; most likely not run with system administrator privileges. the protocol files are usually found in the / var / log folder, for which normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter strip to filter according to a selected criterion or set string. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed to fit the selected filter.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can, of course, select another entry at this point. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the process column process, and then enter the name of a process in the protocol file, so you can see & ksystemlog; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. minutes lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color than minutes of step note. the color representation of protocol lines can be switched off in alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you want to show only a certain process (e.g. in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. for example, this can be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter strip.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the option to skip to new lines from the main window's context menu to display all the new protocol rows.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log message in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website to http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org you will find further information about the sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; Subversion archive: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named so) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init quickly develops into the standard for controlling the program starts when the system starts up in the & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further here on historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is located under / sbin and not / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort contains rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service that you want to start when you boot up the system or switch to another runlevel. system services do not include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail; system services do not include such things like setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks at different places after the program init and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default Runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is 3. if you want to change this, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have a bit messed up then you will repair it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts now? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no proper files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? very easy: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; have a server running level that only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc. moreover, I could also have a user running level, that & kdm;, network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. the entry is removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this only happens when you pull out an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries will be moved if you drag them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you need to explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the trash bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insertion (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the Properties dialog. use the tab button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they will be recovered from & ksysv; changes to the default settings will be stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard running levels, and now the machine is constantly restarting. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the default runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for running under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions but is not a standard. the authors of & ksysv are planning an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are required by the system service (and also if they are in the right directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) simply quit without a message if their configuration files are not present or configured incorrectly.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; Runtime varies from distribution to distribution, may even vary from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the running level so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save them. either use the corresponding icon of the toolbar or the entry in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user and user group list. to edit, select the user or group you want with a double click on the entry. the dialog appears user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings. only when you have enabled wildcard limitations (quota) for users will create a card card on which you can make individual settings. other flashcards appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed as in BSD uniciled.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card file appears, if shadow passwords, for example / etc / master.passwd, as installed in BSD unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized for at least one embedded file system (recognizable by the file "quota.user / quota.group on the file system).</seg>
