although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me , that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter , who with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method One , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year that I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the United States .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I had even written a very s@@ warming love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
he never stays behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number ever reached by the party nomin@@ ee .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
as for example my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person , with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
also Tr@@ ump Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung agreed not with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met in our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
tr@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought for the environment for a long time , and their husband Dave , my host family who treated me like their son .
she still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , she gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the dr@@ unk@@ ers as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respect@@ ful , and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments the cruel decision to up@@ lift a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different than he .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( m . ) : as much as white as the white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities . &quot; word play from white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones called , has exactly killed what America has made so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have , America means everyone welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he says himself , would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the white American promises this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole conception of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
with all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
at a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do Af@@ ro Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a vo@@ iced and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son had fallen sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music through tr@@ ash
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero village in O@@ ax@@ aca Province together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
that the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music , which lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 kilometers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city , which is popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , who has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the municipality located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope .
the young band members take their responsibilities to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga .
music from rub@@ b@@ ish
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometers south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste :
music with re@@ processed instruments made from local solid waste materials are produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers headed by Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez began turning parts of the waste into instruments .
instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were produced from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio showed something that he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a documentation called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance : &quot; &quot; &quot;
every year , the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
with its inspiring drama of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world , Land@@ fill harmonic follows the orchestra .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can effectively tackle illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re@@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a perpetr@@ ator of this species at its coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles mobili@@ zed quickly against the ship . they refused to dock one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it did not succeed in catching fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for the pl@@ under@@ ing of the land &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by N@@ RO stop Il@@ legal fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) .
the members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the six countries that had then driven the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and stand in each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal fishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to track down . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also through the s@@ nail &apos;s pace , with which information circul@@ ated between individual countries , actions are happening in real time , with trace@@ ability to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also tracks the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
this allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . such suspi@@ cious routes can also be discovered - such as those indic@@ ting that a ship will load its captured fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the move and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it then involves significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially not worthwhile any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i as well .
a closed front
the above @-@ mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue which the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen who inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among them also those illegal fishermen .
their practices include sailing under false flag , fake licence documents , ph@@ ant@@ asy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &apos; You can &apos;t start my harbor &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole seeks to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front has been working so far .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 suspected ships .
it has exposed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found escap@@ ing ships .
due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that they like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position . and that &apos;s what we are trying to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a NGO which is also involved in fishing data and offers technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
this is why Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i find ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations can really influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine protection organization : a platform that offers satellite data and which can be used to display the position of each tra@@ cked ship worldwide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources to study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project with which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also sc@@ are them off .
ships that had previously been confis@@ cated without license and had hardly had consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now reported a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses ever since .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tra@@ w@@ l nets where it was forbidden to use them .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also note these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
six countries have joined forces there in 2015 , the West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; security is the aim of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state was able to announce his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship was also forced into forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 advoc@@ ated a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a particular , collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the world .

the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on inaugur@@ ation , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void while gathered on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the return of Venezuela ) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also held in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ de@@ an regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located federal state of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country continues to deterior@@ ate , which is reflected in the daily life of the Vene@@ tians by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % to the annual financial statements ) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on im@@ pe@@ de for many as the only way to rec@@ ap@@ ture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civilian strike and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The rec@@ ap@@ ture of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26th . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most commonly shared images shows a demonstr@@ ator who calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cries the Venezu@@ el@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter pictures pil@@ ed up of confron@@ tations , as well as reports of repression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially large waves struck the news of police repression in the central @-@ north located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government &apos;s own testimony to the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because you could see something that many national guards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that de@@ forms the extent of oppression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the claim for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fak@@ ed .
here is your removal !
on the road !
others value these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little action against the devastating economic crisis from its point of view and would rather have been busy making critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which has been published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cór@@ doba .
as a grown @-@ up man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testi@@ fied against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cór@@ doba .
in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought that was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

archive recording .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , accused of ab@@ duction in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ x@@ an@@ os son , a man who realized over the years the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testi@@ fied before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts .
everyone named him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you are friends with one of the ERP .
don &apos;t forget that you don &apos;t have to kid@@ nap you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . because so my father had educated me .
at the military base , I had to destroy papers that had been heard of the prisoners .
these were all sorts of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda materials , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in which cars , furniture , TV , refriger@@ ators - stood everything possible .
everything was stolen .
he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ wed in , and saw a lying where men were tor@@ tured .
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
they seldom caught a man with cu@@ ffs at the bed , poured it with water and pursued him a 220 volt charge into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was app@@ alling ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible for someone else to do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners tied and were bound with cu@@ ffs .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian that was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay with the face down@@ wards - all were tied at hands and feet .
near the entrance people kept quiet on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why have you brought me otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and killed by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms called offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , was sentenced to death by the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
the following video shows Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way where the ab@@ duc@@ tions came here .
if you look at the map , you will see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the det@@ ain@@ ees were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the arrangement was from above that they were to be laid .
this was the lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military badges , which one takes away an enemy that is fought .

but if one goes into a house and the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , that is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I answered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you &apos;re not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and cried ,
if you go so far , I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do so !
that is how my father was .
I have no good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes .
at that time , the defense of me accused me of being a con@@ voy of this crime . I said no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once children have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you did execute people during the dictatorship , but why did the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap your children ?
one day my father brought a girl back home whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl .
I repeatedly asked the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ?
did these people not even have families to hand over their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the body is the last abom@@ inable act one can do to a human being .
my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but of course something always remains .
&apos;@@ i &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of seeing my father arose during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to take part in it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he just said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well then I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I delivered the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally said against my own father .

after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and nine cases of imprisonment between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error at a center in Kyoto where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was distributed in the social media .
arrangement of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving licence , witnessed a very failed translation during the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word was on a sign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ol@@ der motor@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - maybe also with malicious background thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
editing of original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media .
the error occurred to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the Kyoto @-@ appearing daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the more appropriate , albeit gram@@ mati@@ cally correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Kyoto ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger covered the ap@@ ologies as follows :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correc@@ tions ( the translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drivers in Japan and wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 cases of sen@@ iors were created in 2005 . this corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the so @-@ called re@@ porter brought comments to the light , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to he@@ y against older drivers :
among other things , the article on Yahoo &apos;s translation error has received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So faulty is the translation actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills , in order to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active master@@ y of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English . this may result in a lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , tasting or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who have no foreign employees themselves , can still make translations available in @-@ house . then , the Japanese associate , whose English skills are considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
the sentences , en@@ gen@@ dered and en@@ ig@@ matic by machine translation , show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this applies especially to some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints , which often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards , more careful translation can be expected .
the Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : take protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and TV
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible .
other online stations also took over recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ te . he pointed out that the connection was known and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ ith : re@@ activate your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are locked once more .
this is from the @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net side .
offers like Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media has been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the T@@ elec@@ om Commission threatened to punish them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as &quot; calling for violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO , VE@@ In@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS .
if a website is blocked by DNS , the server rep@@ lies or refuses the request when calling such a website .
we acknowledge a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third sealed channel , the transmission was stopped on Thursday 6th April when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Fl@@ ores , who was carrying the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Fl@@ ores was beaten while he was in police custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country more and more difficult .
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to get an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ te as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ mes who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she started working as a Cri@@ mean for the family . in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls are forced to work to go to school .
the business is very simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or their under@@ age daughter to another , rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , a training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot lift .
this practice referred to as cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mes - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced .
she tried to name things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is inj@@ ected to the Cri@@ mes is generally not silent .
&quot; the Cri@@ mean az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in the belief that she will complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of itself &quot; can be handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation with faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ved .
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon occurred , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent be@@ atings .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra ended up with a cane on Mar@@ ín until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ mean .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the Cri@@ mean az@@ go &apos;s death for the girl &apos;s death deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they designated the Cri@@ mean az@@ go as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that &quot; no other Carolina &quot; could exist in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without documents , it is much easier to inf@@ ringe the rights of children .
without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ mean .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be trend @-@ setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ mes are exploited not only as labor force , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign up bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
but they all went further to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as a Cri@@ adi@@ te .
in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
for example , it clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also did not have unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to take more books from the house library than food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 , belonged to the opposition .
in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and read als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but she didn &apos;t talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would again learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , they explained .
but she was fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ minated against . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment facing Cri@@ mes when they go to school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ tiqu@@ ette .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone home to me . I had no circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships are formed , I particularly felt that I belonged to no group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
society endor@@ ses the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ atric nur@@ ses in Paraguay .
the administrator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I am looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman , who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author retri@@ eved once again :
dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mes , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ mes , how long ago ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mes , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we have managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , Cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , where the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ ani were forced to pay tribute and Spanish in@@ doctr@@ ination were subjected to them ) and the system of the Mens@@ ú ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) , and that they become easy victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and that to display power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill calls on Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
Pix@@ ab@@ ay image , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to regulate the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when adopted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would be set up , which is in charge of giving citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users of the website would have to register with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fin@@ es .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ es in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video message and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad@@ Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , MP and promot@@ er of the legal situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and a password &quot; to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ) at the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices :
I doubt the technical capabilities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that as well as they control violent physical and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be approved as law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its adoption and implementation will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensuring that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration is present on the surface of the image , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y , proposed a legal situation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life imprisonment sentence for those convic@@ ted would be found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; insti@@ lling demonstrations . &quot;
how a Kurdish conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq designated by war

this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this article is published here as part of an agreement for content sharing .
high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the northeast of Iraq , the activists H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and their team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which stre@@ ak through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature .
why is this particular le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . therefore , when the team in the video states that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a is passion@@ ately fond of a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs from Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , she is also a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to establishing shel@@ ters for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region .
Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ maker , has produced this video for En@@ sia .

in early March 2017 , the Daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , which is responsible for the nor@@ theastern Japan , has documented the progress achieved over the past six years to revi@@ ve the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was one of the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbors suburbs Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were ev@@ acu@@ ated , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture saw a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from a local perspective , what progress was made six years later in order to rebuild the local life .
the detailed report of the paper includes statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( the inc@@ er@@ . , ad@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was reported by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ ac@@ uation of housing shel@@ ters ( in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) is still trying to res@@ ett@@ le in final replacement buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the three @-@ fold catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in housing shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 , more and more 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes .
almost 40 percent of Ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma still live in emergency shel@@ ters in 2011 , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated people who lived after the disaster in housing shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led into final homes .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 1,@@ 0@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools affected by mis@@ fortune have opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i fishing har@@ bours are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed ar@@ able land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed ar@@ able land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the nuclear waste zone .
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far behind .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only show 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants have been making it more difficult to earn their living .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to be able to identify a general picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ates . she questioned them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their reception changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done .
as it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper gained attention to the situation of the ev@@ ac@@ uation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , atomic accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture by 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ates from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
at the beginning of 2016 , some more than 23@@ ,000 people were res@@ ett@@ led back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , in permanent replacement homes .
as of 2017 , more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma live outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation groups are older than 50 years old . they are known to fail because efforts to re@@ construct Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people from other countries meet who speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we are looking closely at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . release with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva in a widespread photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer had struck him with a strike in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás reported that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from the active service until the investigation of the incident .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ al@@ ador , &quot; a media channel by media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly rush to it .
another video with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus starting from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in a different state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian rel@@ ays ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while he is in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experiences a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he had sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have taken the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who has been attacked by a police officer who has struck him with a stick in his face .
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday .
police officers were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
s &amp; D Euro MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to renoun@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud speakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media has sli@@ pped off street protests by focusing on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window to illustrate their front pages with a photo .
on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic background to report on a broken window of windows than the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Villa@@ ges in Cuba &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba attracted the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the popular parish Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there are no significant sugar @-@ harvesting on site .
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry stopped in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding remained of steel and concrete .
approximately 27@@ 2 workers had to re @-@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , does not ro@@ b his sleep in the sugar cane industry .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active time because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members that Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich would receive the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry has already opposed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not a novel@@ ty any more .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated and barely competitive , they became intol@@ erable for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons .
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Department of Agriculture and Food .
if current production would reach the 2001 level ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around $ 85 million for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will surely enter history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; dec@@ eit . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of leap , the first letters began to come .
these were officially written documents , which were distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date .
all were signed by Ul@@ san Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was over@@ hau@@ led and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories operated in operation , &quot; he affir@@ ms .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work@@ top producer has been er@@ ased out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives to the jobs and services they were generating in the communities in which they were present .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather said , when they began to disman@@ tle it , they also stopped asp@@ hal@@ ing the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged other businesses as well .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to pick up other factories .
they were assigned to spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area , a food factory was created whose production serves not even for the care of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .
at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma factory , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring a rent of two thousand p@@ es@@ o per month to the old soldier to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that were told him .
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
N@@ ene works in pension with 65 years , not because it lacks power , but because it is bitter .

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and preserve their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo used with permission from N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities all over Canada deal with themes that are important to them . they do this via Hip @-@ Hop , thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to accommodate youth groups , song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cre@@ e @-@ communities in North Que@@ bec and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop concludes that the young participants find topics such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
because the workshops were so popular , the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the US state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ ch@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a stretch of road in West Kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases have mostly not been clari@@ fied .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always speak native languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ pi@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e .
the youngsters involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as is a translation into English translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever &apos;s interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will take our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and also proceed to our youth
this is how they can do what they intended for the Creator .
in the commentary section , the reader and advocate of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse to sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ok@@ u@@ hin ( &quot; Plas@@ tische Modelle der dishes &quot; ) of any dish served in this restaurant .
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them any more . however , a new trend changes them today into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin d@@ ab@@ u .
now at the special sale : new mobile phone lines decorated with plastic dishes , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in essenti@@ als is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case , a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular dish ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
this is also part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping which is served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anybody who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members with unpleasant surprises .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also pad@@ dy balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
further whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi district , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports from domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the reports on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looking at the gri@@ eving or the churches who have learned to live with the pain .
behind each bone find behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Poli@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , which will give these victims a voice and tells stories about people who were in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime can not only be feared for our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid of life &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who , every weekend , scans secret graves after his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday , we prepare ourselves again today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should be back on October 15th , but he never came back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is also my mother , who is also here with me .
at the moment she has no income .
you have the assurance of my father , but she doesn &apos;t pay her out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where shall we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for some years now .
I pass newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this to be normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that they also happen to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ tim@@ el@@ essness of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified in such a way that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ ggy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not touched and silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the central district district : how a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; it describes how armed criminals each month pressed money from their business until they destroyed not only the business , but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain never fails , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the farther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you .
I asked myself in these terrible days whether tears would dissolve my deep root feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as and make &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably to a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence by organised crime and the fight , on the other hand , mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor counted 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this equ@@ als to 8.5 kill@@ ings per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to represent the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this article and the pages to which he links , contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a sc@@ aff@@ old or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to illustrate trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; incorrect description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant accurate coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker tra@@ vers@@ ed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country has been neglected for years and devast@@ ated by it . the roads in the region have become dangerous paths of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to it .
local dign@@ it@@ aries described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a movie in the vicinity , which was full of people watching the World Cup Championship .
houses burned and char@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were un@@ recogni@@ z@@ ably burned .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horrible scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows ranges of char@@ red bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo was inter@@ viewed several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses drastically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be visually displayed .
the occasion for the attack was also unclear , but the military base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ an and the trial of the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented regulations concerning Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
one more step further , personal comments , such as this example , mistakenly evo@@ ke the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media to supply arguments .
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash message published by the United Nations , those who could flee could blows , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following were published , which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture origin@@ ates from an Saudi Arabian news page , which fal@@ sely claimed in 2012 , the Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein , monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein this statement , but had not associated the image from DR Congo .
the world @-@ wide range of false data
traces of these false coupl@@ ings date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the help of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the mentioned image from DR Congo .
they come from a mixture of private sites , social media platforms and community as well as national publications , and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have sent false reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of mis@@ use and associated them with the respective countries , based on what they were published on which side . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked together ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news frames .
examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers where fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available .
the Gra@@ y Coun@@ tries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , may also instruc@@ t for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread on the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Canada , 2015 .
in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City is not only nam@@ ing the ho@@ ax , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( DR Congo and beyond ) .

La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one who used the image from DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , clearly no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster have seen this .

Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims via the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of DR Congo .

Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo taken from DR Congo became evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo , with a tweet that expresses sympathy with the Nig@@ eri@@ an massac@@ res and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to off@@ end the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being prosec@@ uted , as the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a judgment on what it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ alised news and photos submitted to international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this judgment , which appeared exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ ents that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to expose that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dissemin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .

this post , directed at the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly shows that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news site fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted his 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will still be included .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , who now is near Kath@@ olische Universität , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later turned into circulation in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Sonn@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) but the messages that were associated with it were not interfer@@ ed with in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to focus attention on the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 .
after a message that was allegedly written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it ho@@ ax .
the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated from the message in which the image was contained in the DR Congo .
there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
in other countries , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the grey folder ) , Tin@@ eye also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( frames ) that go through these posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photograph was used for greater discussion of the silence associated with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or , for the defense of Muslims , the assass@@ inations of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued compared to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with social media , there are tens of people who inad@@ vert@@ ently participate in tr@@ ashing the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does this mood suggest false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is concern that violent images can sensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study which investig@@ ates how violent media work to help others ) .
while there is a lot to debate about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will need to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which an image suggests something , which can actually be reli@@ eved from context or completely impro@@ per style .
however , each study of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used in accordance with CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) endeav@@ ours to provide language enthusiasts a choice of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all not to translate .
there are words in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well @-@ known today ( such as the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( e.g. Spanish so@@ bri@@ mes@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
one word or phrase is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s VAT @-@ cla@@ p language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have war@@ med yourself in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page would like to publish more of these &quot; inv@@ alu@@ able &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite albums here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ ding and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which normally ends at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya passed over the shore in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion of the disaster relief center of Sri Lanka , from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge @-@ av@@ al@@ an@@ ches .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( May 26 ) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe places .
the ra@@ ins continued on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was standing in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . Mor@@ ago@@ da village near G@@ alle was also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a river .
the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and five other five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants enclosed in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also decided to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian assistance .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry foods and nec@@ essi@@ ties of life for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ col@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if animals in this area need help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pick@@ Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taxi call ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ac@@ entre will be informed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood control &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; key that resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exhausted , bring people in need for safety and provide aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , while the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and a friend .
I trust in her four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next step we will vote for trans@@ gender rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some keep the icon@@ ographic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend is looking at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination .
they do not extract me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t look all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , like I don &apos;t fit in there , have to be de@@ human@@ ized .
to be de@@ mus@@ cul@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this is even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you get into the mind when you think of it ?
love ? love ?
peace ? peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Qur &apos;an , and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western world , the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as did the most popular translations of its poetry .
this del@@ usion is a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing pic@@ torial language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these images are still prot@@ ru@@ ding today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to understand .
I &apos;ve worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has resulted in nine Muslim women in their countries over the last three decades , while the US could not even vote for its first female candidate .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , both of which are two sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who engage in movement for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has so deeply and fla@@ wed our collective imagination that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims in the highest grade make up &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious groups in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ ethnic Americans .
six of ten American Muslims belong to the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .
the author &apos;s parents in 1976 in New York .
approved use .
four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother introduced her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ lu@@ r Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan re@@ invented the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were sore Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American woman ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , all Muslims carry with them - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I j@@ est , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be a &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , who have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell her , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears down a woman &apos;s head .
or as the frigh@@ tening card of attacks on mos@@ ques across the USA , see below .

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
it interfer@@ es with our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but to be a Muslim was born into my imagination when I was four years old in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim belief and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ni@@ ghtly ritual with my daughter if I kept her silent in my arms and she whis@@ pered the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .
the author &apos;s grandmother , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters at some point in the 1960s .
approved use .
belonging is the image of my grandmother in my mother &apos;s side with her sisters ; how she could win a contest for the art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the image of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her finished and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi sa@@ intly ; and a Qur &apos;an containing many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means to speak the prayers that she had told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be a Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - have been colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire , &quot; which a company founded with the name Ehr@@ lich Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord .
the author with her grandfather in 1987 .
approved use .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying .
in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an was forced to cry for his family in India dominated by K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he could not close in half a century into his arms .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have split the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all been &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped over a Muslim country before a century ago .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ t@@ arian of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .
the word of Islam .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion go deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es ; our un@@ rec@@ alled history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops divided over every continent apart from Antar@@ c@@ tica , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy asks the US and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave named Bil@@ al .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar called Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means nam@@ ing Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports in order to fight against Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but to fail to communicate them to others .
the narrative of 1.7 billion offers more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in reducing doubt &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in the Muslim registr@@ atures that began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five year old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries that are bombing them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we are leading and the bombs that we acc@@ use to Muslim lands .
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University took a scientifically in@@ correct picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 regarding evolution .
Muslims got the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations That We M@@ ust Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deep to refrain from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ ron@@ izing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stand back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression that we understand in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the pod@@ cast Lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ Feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to print more Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope .

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier , it had not yet existed ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an ir@@ responsible Muslim .
things I have left in my speech like a bread@@ cr@@ umb lane .
&quot; &quot; &quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may lie where someone is made &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations take place within the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .
poster of the Facebook page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia Studies Network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell you here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people will be catalo@@ gu@@ ed by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation four decades ago was even science of Stan@@ ford .
we must ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of this , consciously and un@@ consciously , as it did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he already bombs lost countries and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ ative Art wants to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the insur@@ moun@@ table blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS does not lie on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and honor the variety of languages in large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been carrying out events since 2015 , there is the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
for the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often linked to understanding , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to estim@@ ating , feeling , soci@@ alizing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , story@@ t@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not professional story@@ t@@ ellers , their devotion and presentation lead to the fact that the audience gets involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in D@@ af@@ ing language . during this round , the story t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the har@@ es and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ ara asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness with a broad smile : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and organizers hope to extend this . all those inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story@@ telling .
Puerto Rico ur@@ ges US re @-@ release of sovereign debt
with the aim of re @-@ checking the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , on 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration ; the march started at the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ental Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( citizen front for the ne@@ ural examination of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re @-@ fixing the debt also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico called for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for their debts to be held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that operates in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and supp@@ ressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
this is why the so @-@ called &quot; Zentrum für Neue Wirtschaft , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , proposes a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
actions imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed without the participation and conviction of the citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration was called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night Vi@@ gil for Light and Truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which it is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the A@@ dra prison directory in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information whatsoever about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , right away .
to see how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started thinking about their own f@@ ates , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up in this process of times of extreme convi@@ ctions ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken on the basis of a command of the military court taken out of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer in the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ voc@@ ative than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural styles f@@ use with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , em@@ bo@@ dying this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el has not yet completed this project yet .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overcome when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was already in jail .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ bath , which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together for one year together on the book .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It happens &quot; :
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the mind at the moment we embrace ourselves ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I forget the in@@ sistence of the prison &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say goodbye
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and about your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I am witn@@ essing myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the arrest of Bass@@ el G@@ haz@@ i wrote :
a year goes by , my soul
while at the same time
I am in your cage ,
and you &apos;re still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ essel &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail until 2016 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in the hope that we must do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption @-@ convic@@ ted director after release of prison
Mozambique re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case when a government member returned to work in the state machine after half of his sentence was committed to corruption .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison , together with four other defend@@ ants , who were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , whose advice was held by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which happened on April 19 .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which rejected the application , there would be no reason for Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , as the company did not pursue disciplinary action after his detention .
however , many people don &apos;t call this action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution campaig@@ ning for public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need to know is that even the firm should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
the company apparently remained silent and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; re@@ vo@@ cable &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent person , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been su@@ cked off .
he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has con@@ s@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to inflic@@ t harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
this is a res@@ ounding success !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says , the director does not possess any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has so massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks to return to morality and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served solely on the state itself .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , single @-@ cutting and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral representations was when he asser@@ ted that &quot; an ambitious man was capable of everything , including the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . he changes the tactics but doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and freed .
and today the company , with which he mis@@ ses mon@@ ies , puts it under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ v@@ ai@@ Om@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ deduc@@ tible k . ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or her@@ b@@ ages . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of eastern Indian origin or generally used as ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&apos;@@ Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically cause hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about its use have been cens@@ ored .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtains ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sentence ku la - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet considers that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analy@@ tic before releasing all posts that would be suspected of spreading racism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook does not delete the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the nearby words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( column bus@@ h@@ ings ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech will receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to cur@@ tail their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all , spreading hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat proved that the cens@@ orship of cat@@ ch@@ words is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternate sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished by the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing contents for 24 hours because the post office &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author thought that extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ sely deleted posts .
if they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automated cens@@ orship caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech , but were removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is intended to additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where disputes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure to control the balancing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese side .
but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in terms of context than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the to@@ e
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , Parliament of the country unanim@@ ously adopted a law to ban this practice , so that the age of marriage can now be 18 .
prior to this amend@@ ment of the divorce , some members held Hind@@ u and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there was a major public out@@ cry . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sian Mahar@@ aj , a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , , every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children already married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media moves ende@@ a@@ vor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws on inf@@ ancy , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped bring about this outcome .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about saying to the critics of the child marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition prov@@ oked tension in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was adopted against the child marriage - despite 4 Sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent committee , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children before was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one on the other .
after the decision was made before the Senate , the draft can now become law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on children &apos;s marriage had finally been changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who held a minist@@ erial post at the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that disgu@@ ised the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost any price .
while Abel Jackson thought that it took a long time to complete the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al@@ - Thomas saying , &apos; Excell@@ ent news !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the divorce law has been decided . &quot; &quot; &quot;
minimum age - 18 , - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
• Fol@@ low Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly spoke about the importance of the adoption of the law :
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft amend@@ ment to the amend@@ ment was approved today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 members in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who agreed to vote have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the marriage is legally prohibited in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ marri@@ ages abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take out judicial steps , and the law should be adopted , and he seems to make his promise now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al Ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
rather Sat , instead of discussing the discussion so broad@@ ly , in a way that can only cause panic and dis@@ grace when we , instead of talking about the problem , would just specifically talk about the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are in favor of them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the inf@@ ancy is legal or still the norm , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit it .

by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content

Turkey has been blocking its popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based on Wikipedia .
day after day , it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to using b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence of the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to be blocked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform put off all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which is not based on the domain name system and makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is , in spite of the legal prohibition , available .
in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after having heard the news ( about the ban on Wikipedia ) , we all set out to place sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents on decentr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org themselves .
IP@@ FS also indicated that this step was done regardless of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is just screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ ors pages when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked .

you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see is from Wikipedia .
in essence , the server keeps sending the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

I live at the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just felt at home when I suddenly called me Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a phone call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river was a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was in and I immediately started to bend the pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar asp@@ ires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and wants to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know , for he was already face to face with Tig@@ ers :
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
bed@@ time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ zz@@ ard appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
&quot; &quot; &quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar will place the logo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) in its photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wild animals is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent to shoot pictures of Ot@@ ters at Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see some of these photos below .

this article was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international collaborative media organisation from India .
a revised version was again published as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women avoid mentioning the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , and fear of consequences should dis@@ regard the norm , maintain this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a by a mock tribunal and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also is also common among men . however , they have far fewer re@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all which , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel as well as house@@ wives , appeared in a unique club and became the main theme of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the Campa@@ ign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates the exploitation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices such as child marriage up to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected people , and manages these clubs .
it reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion was about women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to mention the name of their hus@@ bands , is a custom that they all have du@@ ly maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ ep@@ tive , as a woman without mor@@ als .
the tradition is so deeply entr@@ en@@ ched that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name from now on . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club with this self @-@ confidence in their luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to get the discussion going .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell her husband &apos;s name with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everyone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini nar@@ rates :
a woman was so shy that she ch@@ ained only before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at their names .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received numerous reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband &apos;s husband was less understandable and the situation turned out to be violent .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as wearing the in@@ ox @-@ red dot on the forehead that shows the mar@@ ital status :
why only women have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin @-@ red dot if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely ceased , but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it in some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every disc@@ us club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , for example our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes .
some women in the group have only taken sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most people this is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ em @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they didn &apos;t dare .
after a lot of debate and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of dress , the mor@@ als related to the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled its own pair of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will create it .
Roh@@ ini affir@@ ms the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club , that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped talking about the name of their husband .
some , including me , make it still , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini explains :
every one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on 29 June this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag ( Beat@@ les @-@ Memorial Day ) was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .

the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who inter@@ viewed Beat@@ les 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese go through .
the people here quickly became clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .

and as it is for fans , Japanese also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places connected with the band .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit . &quot; &quot; &quot;

exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year as well .

good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen !
and what could that be for one day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;

bald men are de@@ ported and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be attacked in Mozambique .
photo : other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for ab@@ used purposes , concerns the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ton , a few kilometres from the Malawi border .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and a part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia visited the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the UN to perform a mission in the South African country in 2016 to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government has developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
attention to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , the Mozambique police warned of the newest mur@@ ders of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ton , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ hai Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ t@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in view ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a faith existed , according to which the victims had power in mind that the riches were generated .
in recent days , three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country .
on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor S@@ nai@@ vely who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mozambique , THE S@@ ME embarrass@@ ed A country where the people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , and to take sex against good marks , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald men are hun@@ ted for un@@ faithful purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; that aim to attain fast riches .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humor were not to be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ deca@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ori , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ faced :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim authorities are very concerned about the assass@@ inations of bald men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced late June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threat ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding the democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man said he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China will continue to receive appeals from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or allow him a treatment abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations Rel@@ ated nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to facilitate the treatment of Li@@ u abroad .
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Liko &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the transfer of salmon to China , since exports have largely been blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union ( EU )
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she announced in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they are to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that Americans &quot; wish him to have the possibility of treating abroad , in so far as it helps him with his recovery . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy would ask Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy promp@@ ts a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement by the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told me that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of his choice , according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations .
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I urge China to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on July 7 and 8 , Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u might over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police ever monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada ur@@ ges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of speech , and to allow for the exercise of these rights blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where it is needed . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually accept it .
Taiwan , Taiwan
the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan requested China to release Li@@ u on June 27 and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator , Yu @-@ Me@@ i @-@ nu , from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried in an explanation on June 28 at Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o who signed Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the only Singapore political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a duty of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &quot; normal countries &quot; in view of that , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
once you reach the core of the subject , the good old body turns up again from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were responses to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged appropriate questions with non @-@ answers of a rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the effort to clear that point , provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out critics concerning the reviews that you should start reading the entire address of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equi@@ vocal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the US ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades to win ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what expects me - be I with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes this is right and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cre@@ dul@@ ously commit a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian advoc@@ ates ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , in which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since it plays an important role within the cabinet &apos;s cabinet , the statements made by Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city , but not their country ?
who must pay back our prime minister ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
according to the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many Singap@@ or@@ ean ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island nation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of defending the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices just asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the newest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I come from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have been living in Japan .
depending on the situation in which the interview takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication mostly follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook in@@ war@@ dly with anger if they are kept for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know , there is little that Canadi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans will bring a Canadian flag clearly visible on their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always taken small map@@ le leaves to their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we evi@@ dently say very often &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you were to be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ook@@ y - just like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one &apos;s own Canadian double boar@@ ders ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , that would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing to face .
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and not worthy of any attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main characteristic of the Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to just take care of our own affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence along with the neighbors .
we lack the warm hearted , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
fortunately for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau sets the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our Prime Minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ oned Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and , in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ des Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells the instructions he makes his girlfriend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although not expressly political , the music video still refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Thailand blocked after a group of activists invited the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics Thailand has insi@@ sted on in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changing of settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unity in the army was established , the online content monitored and people accused of slan@@ dering the monarchy was prosec@@ uted .
Thailand uses a stri@@ k@@ eted end to &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic off@@ ence ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before placing them in an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long sentences of imprisonment , they should off@@ end the monarchy .
meanwhile , the band &apos;s te@@ aser shows members of the band that im@@ itated Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ hic war was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ i are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , East Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the Soviet area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people after having barely climbed over a decade .
in 1989 some 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey housing blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , known as K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ho@@ v@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community .
now there is only paved road with most remaining splend@@ our @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have left the district now .
in the ghost town D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which still house one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in my hand , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to let us take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the District Administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman called Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her oldest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave before Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ ina &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ad@@ mits . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 year old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when vac@@ ations , we visit us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ asha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could add zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ asha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day , they remember the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but that will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time , she lost her anxiety .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy is running over to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they walk , some of them throw stones on the deca@@ yed buildings .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border from Mexico to Guatemala .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ colored ear rings in ted@@ dy bear form .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ er@@ and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians , who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the nights sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and metal beds .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - however , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are coming here .
sometimes , says Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez , people come in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? &quot;
at present , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also have slept outside on boxes .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys drugs that they cannot pay , she massages them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted by the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the cor@@ di@@ ality of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti .
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that the Afri@@ cans talk about Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez already on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Championship .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he said , smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez says that her guests often send her text messages when they left to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has started helping them to get a reasonable price , then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing .
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after he lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , single educ@@ ator , offered him their roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next steps .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is again full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors the travel@@ er quietly consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grandmother , she leaves her album with many photos .
there is one her daughter with African hair spots , which she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly as she introduces her to me .
&quot; Ya &apos;s fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats her every time . &quot; they have gone on . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their phones .
on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi have received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the communication , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities used the app to use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they had installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the notification of the police that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their own home network .
this App with filtering for min@@ ors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while noti@@ fications of digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict zones , the authorities often order extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police checked the residents indi@@ scri@@ min@@ ately if they had installed the surveillance app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are discovered on a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are thought for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the training technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
all government departments , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office to operate their computers and communications equipment .
a current Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; registered at local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of the indigenous people of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ leep or Death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are all alone in a place where all the important is gone .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth which is clearly recognizable , both from the inside and from the outside .
one that gives honour to their name .
one who has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but when reality catches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is spinning on the axis of disaster . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and in front of them your grand@@ parents , stone built for stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the districts sought , but my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat after the power supply in the quarter ceased to function .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice echo through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a glorious picture that filled my expectations completely .
at such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit out of the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice after scre@@ aming all the way up to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I do now .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you cry &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are brave enough to cry when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were upon me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really trust what to look into my eyes and not to the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was because of my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause as I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t think you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not having a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father , along with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I plan all the details exactly before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoner and may sit down immediately without waiting for their permission .
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the cler@@ k left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : hitting the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first@@ fruits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks like me and is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in perfect darkness , no distinctive facial features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred into one of the large cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would let him go if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to disp@@ el all these crow@@ s , which are lab@@ oured in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance , I hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cries , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( like : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; you are here to get interro@@ gated . &quot;
thus the secret was revealed : to protect the state security against us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itors and terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ e dialect - thus they played their denom@@ in@@ ational black@@ mail card and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse they call co@@ existence to transform the criminal of their c@@ lans into a hero .
I enter the interro@@ gation room and meet at Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he happens to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest in demonstrations that will soon come to an end anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I &apos;ve got used to it , not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly conversation have become an ordinary means of communication for me .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment .
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the lovingly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you can &apos;t measure yourself with him , and you can &apos;t hold back your cry .
my scre@@ ams were not enough for him yet , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest I wondered if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or if that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us the great invention of a gigantic cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still on the line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er re@@ marked the cooling and didn &apos;t find any favor from it , so he was next to an electrically charged staff .
electricity f@@ lowed all my body , enough to supply my whole district .
my half naked body lying on the floor was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to go to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which occurred to me just as minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young man : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be moved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he stro@@ lls to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and back to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the highest level of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ es ( for example : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist facing the conservative majority and questioning its old @-@ established views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed music .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by borders , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not openly admit it , he is against the American foreign policy a special reluct@@ ance .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation , &quot; he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so , because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while he poured a Nes@@ café in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan . during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that eating food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , having a cup of coffee at a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the pieces of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ ist@@ ers of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan , to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that Hamas &apos;s sexual orientation contradic@@ ts Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms , and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
the MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert was &quot; straight &quot; cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tried legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la valued the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should not be simply rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflected a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zed reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b held back traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who pre@@ mar@@ ted sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently low @-@ tro@@ dden unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they really should trust .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the past few years , the number of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honour kill@@ ings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of geno@@ cides in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of family violence can &quot; det@@ ained in@@ definitely &quot; and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures and family guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman .
even H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is well known not to shy away from topics that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have been informed about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b occupies the question of the Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are at the core politically can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b published a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse repe@@ ats quite often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is also . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it belief or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian people and that comments on gender equality have been strongly cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya in order to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and reviewed in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed was only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires open for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not dis@@ agree with Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ ovo , a poet of the eighth century , still alive today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ ova , who later was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ phs , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the 8th century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not do that ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ian Kingdom , there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ ti@@ fies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took several former members of the government and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that they were critical of the problems associated with corruption in the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it sees H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing up his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and artificial kinds of demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes this .
until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ ras@@ a festival .
it is thought that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the solid carri@@ ages , the drums and dancing were passed over more than one thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ ras@@ cal Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high fort was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans trade weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

seldom outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession as the hair course .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street rau@@ b and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 shows that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens move into the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the dres@@ sage competition &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
experts will compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions like the school Augu@@ sto Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor advice to get an education in the hair@@ dressing art that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March , and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because from love to the children we have built this educational community .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with friendly permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After@@ T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel ej@@ ected ?
this is exactly how the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ ic Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation inspired them to write letters to the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la @-@ li@@ ación ( letters to reconciliation ) , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters .
only recently was their country the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their share : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ erri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the International was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who lived in illegal detention for many years and were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying weapons around the clock must now integrate themselves into living as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now enter its ranks and support them in the establishment of a new life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must unite and help in the integration process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most pressing response this year .
thus the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former warri@@ ors of the F@@ ARC which must now find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ I never thought anyone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ ic Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC have set themselves up as they had done before to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in @-@ between , &quot; said the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him tightly and placed me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , so sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons .
but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
at the beginning , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were joined by a discussion round .
the students were all grown up as already war and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have explained the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice worked from the state to the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society in this country more just .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear these people who had never heard a hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that peace would rule after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to take arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is fully justified ( ... ) .
we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons .
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - regardless of race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles along our way , but together we will overcome them .
a trans@@ woman talks about the persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mac@@ aro@@ ova and whose first publication took place on the OC Media website .
gay and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months of the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed by a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert above the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there has not yet emerged overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that deal with the deportation , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities det@@ ecting suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and hiding them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt she was really a woman .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen had experienced the gender equality of their rural women , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
for fear of their lives , they finally moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone of whom I thought he was a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents made the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
when I was about to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you from your uncle . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you still dish@@ on@@ our the family , you sc@@ andal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
apparently some women had all got along and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wing .
OC Media : in which patient &apos;s wings were you placed - in the men or women of the women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my male name is still on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
I received threats last February .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
this was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they set up absurd requirements : some said to me , I must prove it by running through the streets above ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have cup size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to cope with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a number plate with a 95 .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for safety reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
I bought it without registering , without reference , without anything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in to the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I received a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;re in security , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you &apos;re stuck . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only to prove it to you , it is number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o topic .
I still carry some traditional cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really try to figure out how the person looks at them from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who are dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he told us that during Ram@@ adan there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not lock up a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are there still gay men captured in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says that there were just not many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; court &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this now only a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new since then .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken .
until now , however , they were not introduced as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports about it so far . we suspect that such actions are possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already happened in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already in the whole of Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in the seri@@ ousness of life !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when the Sh@@ aria was applied , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than it is now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to lead us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally dropped us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had tin@@ ted lashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops .
the Sh@@ aria Security Department has never bent my hair on me .
before the Russian theater in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; car@@ rot is not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
one often says it to children , when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten me .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking about morality on television .
he did not speak about us per se , but primarily about women &apos;s behaviour .
nevertheless , one could sense how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I &apos;m still active as a activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food tickets .
I don &apos;t spend any c@@ ents for this .
I discovered these people myself when I r@@ att@@ led some kind of refuge .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to famili@@ arise you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
the Da@@ gest@@ an have which , the Cab@@ ins have which , the Russians have also what ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
know , many think of transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personally , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
since the last few months there has been a strong surge of su@@ ici@@ des .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ inc@@ iner@@ ation of a man called J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , is ramp@@ ant .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous .
a video divided on YouTube kept the moments after he had lighted himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - were hang@@ ed .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ ots who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region , which is a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran , has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives little from this wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs to work in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ t water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi youths now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director of co@@ operatives , work and social welfare reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % a secondary school , and 45 % have a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of su@@ ici@@ des among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans arriving in Ah@@ wa@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process :
since officials and institutions do not prefer to recru@@ it Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living out of their homeland , Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing .
given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists kill an alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking notice of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the website A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women - who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put through well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should be feminine in general .
for example , in spite of the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms continue to ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on sex still stretches across the many different countries and fai@@ ths .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , when I come to talk on skin color , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and out of the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; ex@@ alt their voices and sing &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that there is an institution@@ alised form of rac@@ ist violence in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , which we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or , that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all the women , all men and all men of all skin colour to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman I cannot join a movement whose centre is the white woman who refuses to consider ine@@ qualities in her thinking , which refer to both sex and skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ fem@@ ini@@ zed @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical perspective , a margin@@ alized and margin@@ alized being . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to reveal white women the importance of over@@ lap of skin color and gender . for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better .
although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women from different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still lies in its name .
I prefer to release myself whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly from femin@@ ism and join the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was launched for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of defending myself for a white @-@ fem@@ ini@@ zed paradigm that is so ob@@ st@@ inate that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : rec@@ la@@ iming : ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately cry out separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift up black women and women from other cultures because I exist in this paradigm .
I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither ignored , nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article is again published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relates Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ borne Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ Based Alliance that works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and published by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , a documentary film@@ maker based in Er@@ bil , Iraq .

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ ys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; by sculp@@ tural .
most names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a Police Commissioner A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez said that she could not do anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be placed on the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena for mal@@ treatment , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s informed ad did not use anything .
a few days later , the second woman returned her ad .
it is difficult to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women .
in general , if women are reporting an adver@@ t at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse it . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement agencies .
content 1 Imp@@ act and statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ ni@@ v@@ 3 Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation hits and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research facility in Paraguay .
the available numbers , however , are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 AD reported cases of domestic violence in the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence at the Peace Cour@@ ts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women claimed that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not do this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s suicide is not an individual criminal offen@@ se in Paraguay , law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women each year are murdered by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to her estimates , every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want that , but after that she gave up . this should always regret her .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
I never thought that I would be a victim of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
when I read about it , I always thought that it only happened women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people answered their contributions , among them Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had left Carlos for so long and didn &apos;t leave him before .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain blame on it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in some way victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with mental mal@@ treatment .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he started beating them .
Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a trial against her former partner , who developed into a non @-@ man@@ a@@ geable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good but cannot be applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the indication of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a draft bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # für@@ th ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Min@@ os ( # Non Sequ@@ ential ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft of the bill proposes to declare fem@@ ini@@ d to an independent off@@ ence and punish severely as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus the legal text was changed in some respects to also win the MPs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the law , which advoc@@ ated that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is in principle banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original bill of law stipul@@ ated that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence have to bear at the present time , if they simply want to report on display and would like to receive a secure accommodation , impose on the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships .
here , a re@@ think must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal .
who is silent in the face of these facts , complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get away without offen@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was cancelled , calling the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconci@@ le .
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack its victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is regarded as a major set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media still exposed to attacks in Oman one year after a newspaper was banned
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Colom@@ bian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting about corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served a one year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having passed his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has been suffering the most important mini@@ stries in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists , in@@ timi@@ dating and in@@ timi@@ dating .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and incar@@ cer@@ ation three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties in the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; on July 26 , 2016 .
in the report , government officials were accused of pressur@@ ing judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to impose a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited to the special department of ISS and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , ISS received the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on any road , including online , was banned from 9 August 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place on 26 September 2016 .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closing of the paper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted for dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty beyond the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &quot; imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3,000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover , a one @-@ year ban on profession was imposed against the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set up and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the imprisonment of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , where he will serve his one year sentence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Appe@@ als Court also revers@@ ed the decision of the ministry of information to close the paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the Colom@@ bian government .
on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Minister filed another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ equi@@ p the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently been viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the det@@ ain@@ ing of Al @-@ Ha@@ j journalist , the impression that the authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Syrian authorities to :
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j should release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that its journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including legal har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring states by promoting freedom of expression and association , and the right to gather peac@@ efully , support them and provide them with protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more severe effects in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research into these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , research carried out by African scientists helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
it grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at Pennsylvania University , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health care system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( Dis@@ cla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
ran@@ j@@ it War@@ ri@@ ers RW : at present , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens .
GM : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
that has to change , otherwise we will always remain receivers , rather than being a maker yourself .
the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system means that magazines can only make articles available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this article by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding let@@ tu@@ ce in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ geous , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was set by its own imagination and the question of how many types of salad he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding .
the patents applied not only to individual varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green or cur@@ led leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or car@@ rots . because of this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts take care of food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding let@@ tu@@ ce , but in the meantime he needs longer because his work is increasingly difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if there is a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to pack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go too far for salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand in court , no one can breed a new kind of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
however , it is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is growing ever larger in the US and anywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source Bre@@ eding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts at the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the Out@@ ra@@ geous variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the move from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US farmers can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who purchase their seed to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
according to him seed , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seeds , &quot; says he and takes care of the increasingly frequent mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry . &quot; whoever wants to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , as it is far@@ med in farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to ensuring that other seed remains freely available to others , as opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is always available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in his doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability .
there are no such estimates for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown crops such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown so that they exhibit specific desired traits - from those by which their taste or color improves up to those in which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and can withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders takes more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predicted by climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is owned by other breeders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not prevent innovation , but it promotes it by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : 20 years to wait until a patent exp@@ els , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to be able to breed crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us , and it will be made impossible if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all in all , Mor@@ ton is bo@@ thered by the concept of patented plant traits : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i @-@ Board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; whoever breeds a variety , also breeds his own values into it .
whoever believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is very opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , they create most smaller seed companies even without patents - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative through the elimination of plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am stronger than companies that patent it with my efforts to produce something new .
I always need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my grades for a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years , one is protected from competition , which makes it easy for me to think . &quot; worldwide resonance
while the US seems to be a leader in open @-@ source breeding , the concept spreads quickly around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German organisation Agre@@ co@@ l is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a form@@ id@@ able and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot be easily taken into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not a law yet ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to apply the patent office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organised a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed motion and the worldwide trend to pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance to open source seed systems for which the official launch of the seed should be planned next year .
a consortium of environmental and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on E@@ rosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has put together a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a report published by Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . it believes that farmers must have the opportunity to come to seed , replace it and help shape seed policy , so that a stable supply of food can be ensured .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by of O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has paid particular attention to where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to clarify people that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest cens@@ orship targets in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet .
this time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) which documents and reports human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities sharply critici@@ zed this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights is permanent despite this attack and the contemp@@ t of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law to expose and give victims a voice . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barriers and not give up .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , the Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar office of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human Rights Organization of the wave of site barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ sem@@ ination of articles and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government itself was the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider with whom also Zi@@ ck@@ adas blog is located , on the other hand is more accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada commented on the government &apos;s blocking and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) It was possible for them to convey me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs , and any other web page I was working for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to b@@ ypass cens@@ orship .
but now , having locked him up and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones walk the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities locked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
also documented the blocking of providers by b@@ yp@@ assing internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s started .
such practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ oring decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis , by which it can proceed to court against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day , newspapers in all Brazil are reporting with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assass@@ inated , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rob@@ ben Phar@@ m@@ acy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ port@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and a ten@@ se financial situation in 2017 , the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years .
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 212 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; known for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the Editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a 4 minute video divided on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a newspaper tells a newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organizations .
in the editorial , the paper continues :
we are aware that a war discourse , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise atro@@ cities of the police that only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it uses ?
in an article on The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence is a &quot; war . &quot; this is , in her opinion , a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neg@@ lect of public service .
in memory : Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong , according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the latest available data .
none of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the mur@@ ders in the state , Rio is in number 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , like C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , has been empha@@ sizing the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police facility and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this did indeed lead to a decline in violent deaths . for a number of years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria established by the Geneva Convention on the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also causes grave consequences for human beings .
this calls for the state to use resources and means typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost balls . &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is now a week ago that the police came up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities have suffered brutal attacks and block@@ ades , mainly due to the Assad regime over loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans living in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding lands , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel areas have been besieg@@ ed by rebel areas outside Damascus , causing inhabitants to rely on locally produced or tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods , such as meat , have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P , the French news agency :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because you can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is gaining recognition more and more . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms , according to Dr. Lei@@ la , Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do by Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said global Vo@@ ices that they started producing fung@@ al seeds from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom grav@@ ey@@ ard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms all over Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spreading of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home .
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are bound to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the interview with Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la was conducted by Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b and translated by Elias A@@ bo@@ u Ja@@ ou@@ de .
Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of Portugal on 21 October , demanding justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal last week .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of October 15 and 16 , which caused the government to call for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where fires caused 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest monitoring system , which supervis@@ es forest areas via satellite photographs , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the Imp@@ os@@ sible Trage@@ dy
the goal of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire @-@ fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the scale of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &apos;s paper :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would have happened in June as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
furthermore , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the roll reform introduced by the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed construction activity in case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open back door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val continues in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this type .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Protection Agency of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when citizens sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to people with information : using the application fo@@ ster@@ .@@ pt , it made use of its own civilian protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the server did not withstand the rush of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires .
even the founder asked for help :

two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government .
right at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it so , she knew she would not see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn , the boy was supposed to break up .

&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ per remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we also worked .
there was no service there and no heating . we hung N@@ ylon in front of the open windows , so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ k was homeless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high coverage ratios , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions involving asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are impro@@ vised centres in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ bi@@ ased personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which after the registration of the asylum application can still go for months .
until then people who don &apos;t have money for accommodation are either rel@@ ying on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street .
that &apos;s how it took A@@ shar@@ per .
but his un@@ just life @-@ game helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
having worked in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - one Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a great deal of bureaucracy , high taxes and loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , approximately 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some of Afgh@@ an companies have emerged , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Oriental Experience restaurant in which the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ du@@ a the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also have Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ qi &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail , and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ per with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ af also plans to establish a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their food sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end , stability and prosperity are at the end .
now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on their way .
citizen &apos;s report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison .
he reported on the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen @-@ Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration with a government authority .
in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of the regulatory decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and ID number .
those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a pen@@ al payment .
the law , which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may another MP filed a bill of law to be implemented in the tough@@ er pun@@ ishments for insul@@ ting the president or high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law proposition , however , such a crime would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the prisoners .
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he was demonstrating violence against prot@@ esters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 participants arrested during the same incident , four years in prison for a date of trial .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May because the prison management failed according to human rights groups to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened with death penalty due to the fact that many human rights groups agree that there is a pseu@@ do burden including holding hands , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a Criminal Court in G@@ iza cleared the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ sad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
interro@@ gated Tunisi@@ an activists on si@@ fted documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours questioning Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at as well as the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly questioned by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial bill of law , which would guarantee the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption accused officers of am@@ nesty if they return all un@@ lawful received mon@@ ies .
the document published on April 21 on the Na@@ wa@@ at website sheds light on how the presidential plans look to support the legal situation .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected his sources as part of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which grants journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared at the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity ?
according to new regulations of the Government Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media .
in the Reg@@ ulations it is also stated that registration will be necessary with full real name .
analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks is to be achieved . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have suggested in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the information distribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the provincial government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this term is part of a 2014 law thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and forcing them on request to susp@@ end user data .
these websites currently include websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ gor@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was closed because it became &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to insti@@ gate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
it is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website . it is thus , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop to car@@ ve around
after this week &apos;s documents , the UK government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased security powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install software programs that de@@ code data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunic@@ ation companies and intelligence services on the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
