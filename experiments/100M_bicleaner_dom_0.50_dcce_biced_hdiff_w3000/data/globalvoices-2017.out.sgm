<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me, that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter, who with the help of Julia Roberts uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method One," "" "I was as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year that I lived in Arizona had only reinforced my admiration for the United States.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very swarming love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stays behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in pairs for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican primaries was the highest number ever reached by the party nominee.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters to the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">As for example my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer person, with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also Trump Weltanschauung agreed not with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met in our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for the environment for a long time, and their husband Dave, my host family who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump made his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, she gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the drunkers as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful, and implies an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments the cruel decision to uplift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different than he.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (m.): as much as white as the white against all other ethnicities. "word play from white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, as the great Van Jones called, has exactly killed what America has made so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter if myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have, America means everyone welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he says himself, would nowhere else be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the choice of Donald Trump, however, a huge part of the white American promises this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole conception of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">With all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd answered with a loud" "" "No!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd roared." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they answered." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried, and their voices became louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "would anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a voiced and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son had fallen sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero village in Oaxaca Province together with the children of the Paraguayan city Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played in both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music, which lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city, which is popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, who has found a way to overcome poverty with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The municipality located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth offered such a rare hope of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their responsibilities to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from rubbish</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometers south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest landfill site of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made from local solid waste materials are produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers headed by Favio ChÃ¡vez began turning parts of the waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">Instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio showed something that he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "a documentation called" "" "Landfill Harmonic" "" "(Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of trash.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">With its inspiring drama of trash-to-music around the world, Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can effectively tackle illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Republication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a perpetrator of this species at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilized quickly against the ship. they refused to dock one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing license.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do everything," "" "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it did not succeed in catching fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for the plundering of the land's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by NRO stop Illegal fishing (stop Illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the six countries that had then driven the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "they exchange information and stand in each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to track down. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also through the snail's pace, with which information circulated between individual countries, actions are happening in real time, with traceability to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also tracks the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This allows the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. such suspicious routes can also be discovered - such as those indicting that a ship will load its captured fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such studies can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the move and possibly whether they have a penal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. which means that the ships cannot be sold their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it then involves significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially not worthwhile any more." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i as well.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The above-mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose each year because of illegal fishermen who invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among them also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, fake licence documents, phantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "" "" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say 'You can't start my harbor'." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole seeks to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has been working so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 suspected ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has exposed criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that they like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position. and that's what we are trying to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NGO which is also involved in fishing data and offers technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, with which they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">This is why Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i find ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations can really influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine protection organization: a platform that offers satellite data and which can be used to display the position of each tracked ship worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources to study." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project with which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had previously been confiscated without license and had hardly had consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now reported a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses ever since.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped detect Greko 1, the inspectors found trawl nets where it was forbidden to use them.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also note these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">Six countries have joined forces there in 2015, the West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i. "security is the aim of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to be created in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state was able to announce his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship under false flag.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship was also forced into forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 advocated a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a particular, collaborative working method for the protection of the oceans actually works across the world.

<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the removal of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on inauguration, the Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into the void while gathered on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the return of Venezuela) pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also held in other parts of the country - among others in the lowland area of Barinas, in the Andean regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located federal state of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country continues to deteriorate, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venetians by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the removal of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but in the end the holding of a new election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarizes the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rates are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% to the annual financial statements) and in which a grave and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on impede for many as the only way to recapture its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: morning National Assembly, Friday nationwide civilian strike and on November 3 all to Caracas to the Miraflores palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter pictures piled up of confrontations, as well as reports of repression and mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves struck the news of police repression in the central-north located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the government's own testimony to the police and armed advocates of the government.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop police forces, including this woman in the Andean State TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear skirts, because you could see something that many national guards do not have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic makes the round that deforms the extent of oppression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the claim for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road.</seg>
<seg id="185">Myteks Media Labs added:</seg>
<seg id="186">NicolÃ¡s and Diosdado claim that 1% of the signatures are faked.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here is your removal!</seg>
<seg id="188">On the road!</seg>
<seg id="189">Others value these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little action against the devastating economic crisis from its point of view and would rather have been busy making critical voices silent:</seg>
<seg id="190">They took us so much - but also the fear!</seg>
<seg id="191">Marches always increase in frequency and intensity.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez with Luis Quijano, which has been published on 23 August 2016 at DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news page.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As a grown-up man, Quijano now testified against his father as part of the great La Perla Ribera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Intelligence Department 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, accused of abduction in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10 year old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quixanos son, a man who realized over the years the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent over his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I was friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>

<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black-and-white photo and asked me to identify my friend.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you are friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Don't forget that you don't have to kidnap you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP is for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That is why he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. because so my father had educated me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the military base, I had to destroy papers that had been heard of the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all sorts of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda materials, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in which cars, furniture, TV, refrigerators - stood everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen objects were shut down and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">The prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in, and saw a lying where men were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">They seldom caught a man with cuffs at the bed, poured it with water and pursued him a 220 volt charge into the genitals.</seg>

<seg id="288">At that time, the defense of me accused me of being a convoy of this crime. I said no problem, they can put me to the burden of what they wanted.</seg>

<seg id="346">Arrangement of original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong their driving licence, witnessed a very failed translation during the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "the Japanese word was on a sign," "" "Older motorist" "", "which means" "" "older motorists" "", "falsely - maybe also with malicious background thoughts & # 8212; as" "" "terrible drivers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The incorrect translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Editing of original photos by Joshua Levine, which was widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error occurred to the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-appearing daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "" "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was first removed. the term "terrible drivers" (German: "terrible drivers") was later replaced by the more appropriate, albeit grammatically correct name "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the prefecture of Kyoto apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger covered the apologies as follows:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate corrections (the translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">"" "the Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of" "" "fearful" "" "drivers in Japan and wrote:" ""</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "has been denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country is quite a cause for concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 cases of seniors were created in 2005. this corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">In the version of the article published on Yahoo, the so-called reporter brought comments to the light, which show what prejudices some Japanese seem to hey against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">Among other things, the article on Yahoo's translation error has received the following comments:</seg>
<seg id="368">"" "-" "" "Is this (" "" "terrible driver" "" ") about not reality?" "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="374">The website Engrish.com is a real treasure trove for these bizarre mistakes in English.</seg>
<seg id="375">Photo by Flickr user Andrew.</seg>
<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">To translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills, in order to understand the source text and to use active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the initial language - should be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English. this may result in a lack of understanding of translating, tasting or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who have no foreign employees themselves, can still make translations available in-house. then, the Japanese associate, whose English skills are considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sentences, engendered and enigmatic by machine translation, show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this applies especially to some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic prints, which often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards, more careful translation can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The Kyoto city will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>
<seg id="390">Venezuela: take protests and censorship measures on the internet and TV</seg>
<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online channel Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online stations also took over recordings of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups that oppose the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroute. he pointed out that the connection was known and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zenith: reactivate your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet sites of Venezuelan providers are locked once more.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the @ VivoPlayNet side.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers like Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media has been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Telecom Commission threatened to punish them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as "calling for violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO, VEInfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay is inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by DNS, the server replies or refuses the request when calling such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We acknowledge a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">In VPITV, a third sealed channel, the transmission was stopped on Thursday 6th April when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who was carrying the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it has also been reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans access to multimedia reporting on the current events in the country more and more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="412">In Paraguay many girls become slaves to get an education</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a Criadite as a child. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">Today Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collects testimonies from other Crimes who became victims of abuse and discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="415">Photo by Cecilia Rojas. use with kind permission of sculptural.</seg>
<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a report published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">The article is part of a series entitled "Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen," which is edited and republished by Global Voices in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which something has become," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she started working as a Crimean for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is very simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or their underage daughter to another, rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, a training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice referred to as criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints of human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimes - especially young girls are affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is injected to the Crimes is generally not silent.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Crimean azgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family who has their daughter in the belief that she will complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of itself" can be handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and justifies its exploitation with faith is that they give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and might even be starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The Victims of Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon occurred, which takes place in the hidden in Paraguayan households, but a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of violent beatings.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military family TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira ended up with a cane on MarÃ­n until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the Crimean azgo's death for the girl's death deep in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">"" "they designated the Crimean azgo as" "" "a modern form of slavery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that "no other Carolina" could exist in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," complained Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents, it is much easier to infringe the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents, it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was their Crimean.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n could be trend-setting - for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimes are exploited not only as labor force, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to go all the way and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went further to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital AsunciÃ³n as a Criadite.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She got up every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">For example, it cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she was done with learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also did not have unlimited food. "I was allowed to take more books from the house library than food from the fridge," she recalls.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathizers of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989, belonged to the opposition.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings, the landlord Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and read als from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone home to me. I had no circle of friends in school or in the neighborhood.</seg>

<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law, a place would be set up, which is in charge of giving citizens a permit to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users of the website would have to register with their correct names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fines.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs and cures in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video message and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law will be enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. it is unclear how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently not able to guarantee regulation on the level of social media enterprises.</seg>

<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capabilities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that as well as they control violent physical and private spaces, it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">If I take them seriously, it means they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter citizens who seek permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and also to bring them to a court process.</seg>

<seg id="519">Whether its adoption and implementation will be successful or not, the draft "stands in line with a pro-military mindset in parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensuring that no dissenting narration is present on the surface of the image," says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq, the activists Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists of the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which streak through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). in total there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. therefore, when the team in the video states that they have a photo of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza is passionately fond of a different side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still busy with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, the Daily Kahoku Shimpo, which is responsible for the northeastern Japan, has documented the progress achieved over the past six years to revive the lives of those affected by the "triple disaster" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an nuclear accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the Prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was one of the prefectures in Japan's Northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbors suburbs Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture saw a nuclear accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from a local perspective, what progress was made six years later in order to rebuild the local life.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the paper includes statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (the incer., adigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was reported by Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement buildings were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of housing shelters (in the case of "" "" casetsu juutaku "" "") is still trying to resettle in final replacement buildings. "" "</seg>
<seg id="555">After the three-fold catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in housing shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016, more and more 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Evacuates from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters in 2011, while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated people who lived after the disaster in housing shelters were resettled into final homes.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1,074 of 1,100 schools affected by misfortune have opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of Iwate and Miyagi fishing harbours are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have largely affected agricultural land in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed arable land in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is just a consequence of nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed arable land of Fukushima lie in the nuclear waste zone.</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far behind.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only show 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants have been making it more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to identify a general picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuates. she questioned them about the status of the reconstruction and also how their reception changed compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in catastrophes prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">As it stands for those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue of the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper gained attention to the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, atomic accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture by 160 000 Evacuates from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, some more than 23,000 people were resettled back to Fukushima, in permanent replacement homes.</seg>
<seg id="580">As of 2017, more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima live outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuation groups are older than 50 years old. they are known to fail because efforts to reconstruct Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo in 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people from other countries meet who speak a different language, the differences seem to be greater than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that a more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we are looking closely at these global connections. in our Into the Deep Podcast, we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>

<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week. last Friday, a police officer had struck him with a strike in GoiÃ¢nia. millions of demonstrators took part in a protest march against austerity measures.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, studied social sciences at the University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated him on this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s reported that Sampaio was suspended from the active service until the investigation of the incident.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in GoiÃ¢nia (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten up by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be on TV for six months and the entire oppression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralador," a media channel by media activists from Goiana, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net in which you can see how Mateus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly rush to it.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes but filmed from a different perspective is also immersed in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mateus starting from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in a different state, Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian relays (about 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Goiana while he is in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Ãlvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba attracted the doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The popular parish Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - despite the fact that there are no significant sugar-harvesting on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After succumbing, the sugar cane industry stopped in the region, and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the scaffolding remained of steel and concrete.</seg>
<seg id="630">Approximately 272 workers had to re-invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, does not rob his sleep in the sugar cane industry.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive time because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers that MaÃ±alich would receive the sugar cane factory, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry has already opposed the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not a novelty any more.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry turned off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and barely competitive, they became intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tons.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report "Agricultural perspectives" published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Department of Agriculture and Food.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the 2001 level (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate around $85 million for the country.</seg>

<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on 14 May 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">When Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is "deceit."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of leap, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These were officially written documents, which were distinguished only in relation to the parts that would be removed, the addressee and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulsan Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was overhauled and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories operated in operation," he affirms.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another plant, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 working years.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important worktop producer has been erased out.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities all over Canada deal with themes that are important to them. they do this via Hip-Hop, thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to accommodate youth groups, songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked with ten Cree-communities in North Quebec and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop-Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop concludes that the young participants find topics such as" "" "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance" "" "or whatever comes to mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in the US state of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitchkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a stretch of road in West Kanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases have mostly not been clarified.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always speak native languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagpistui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The youngsters involved got some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a strophe in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as is a translation into English translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever's interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will take our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and also proceed to our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers, which is exactly on the menu, are displayed in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin dokuhin dokuhin dokuhin dokuhin dokuhin dokuhin dokuhin dokuhin dokuhin dokuhin ("Plastische Modelle der dishes") of any dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a number of these small companies producing those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them any more. however, a new trend changes them today into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin dabu.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now at the special sale: new mobile phone lines decorated with plastic dishes, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in essentials is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, a kaisen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) has been transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular dish (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">This is also part of the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stand and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping which is served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anybody who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members with unpleasant surprises.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also paddy balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Further whimsical plastic dishes can be found at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the Kappabashi district, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports from domestic and foreign media about the infamous "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The reports on drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looking at the grieving or the churches who have learned to live with the pain.</seg>

<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal Politico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), which will give these victims a voice and tells stories about people who were in the battle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be feared for our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>

<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've been familiar with disease and sensation journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass newspaper kiosks every day and see the pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel like I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that they also happen to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the intimelessness of the people is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified in such a way that they were" "" "soggy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they are not touched and silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the central district district: how a family with threats has been plundered." it describes how armed criminals each month pressed money from their business until they destroyed not only the business, but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>

<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>

<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas and make "chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably to a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, the bloody body of his father, who was shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006, when violence by organised crime and the fight, on the other hand, mixed with the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizens Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor counted 3103 killings. this equals to 8.5 killings per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to illustrate tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "incorrect description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant accurate coverage of events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker traversed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped and exploded. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country has been neglected for years and devastated by it. the roads in the region have become dangerous paths of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank wagon fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Local dignitaries described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses, including a movie in the vicinity, which was full of people watching the World Cup Championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were unrecognizably burned.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture with the title "That is Nigeria." from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows ranges of charred bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was interviewed several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses drastically reported atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained to count corpses," "" "said a citizen to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be visually displayed.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unclear, but the military base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigerian and the trial of the Boko Haram to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented regulations concerning Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One more step further, personal comments, such as this example, mistakenly evoke the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash message published by the United Nations, those who could flee could blows, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following were published, which brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture originates from an Saudi Arabian news page, which falsely claimed in 2012, the Myanmar's Thein Sein, monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (frames) that go through these posts. the first frame is focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used for greater discussion of the silence associated with the murders of Christians by Muslims or, for the defense of Muslims, the assassinations of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued compared to a European or French life.</seg>

<seg id="933">"" "" "" "with social media, there are tens of people who inadvertently participate in trashing the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood suggest false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and does the actual horror of what has actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes these images are even requested by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is concern that violent images can sensitize readers and viewers and take them the ability to feel empathy (such as this study which investigates how violent media work to help others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to debate about violent portrayals in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will need to thoroughly reflect on the situation in which an image suggests something, which can actually be relieved from context or completely improper style.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each study of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) endeavours to provide language enthusiasts a choice of words from all over the world that are difficult or at all not to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are words in each language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well-known today (such as the famous Portuguese saudade) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (e.g. Spanish sobrimesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">One word or phrase is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context is needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's VAT-clap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - Take care of your parents in recognition of your efforts in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the comfort or laziness you feel after you have warmed yourself in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes, how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page would like to publish more of these "invaluable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are.</seg>

<seg id="972">According to an opinion of the disaster relief center of Sri Lanka, from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and nearly hundred people are missing because of the floods and sludge-avalanches.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (May 26) and approximately 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rains continued on Saturday (27 May), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>

<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has built up in their imagination.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They do not extract me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't look all the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves to be a Muslim in different ways. but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, like I don't fit in there, have to be dehumanized.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be demusculated</seg>

<seg id="1015">Peace? peace?</seg>
<seg id="1016">When Jalaluddin Rumi was as old as I am now, he was an Orthodox Muslim preacher and scholar.</seg>
<seg id="1017">Islam, the Qur'an, and the Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the western world, the religion of Rumis was erased, as did the most popular translations of its poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This delusion is a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another exists in the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonising Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This enticing pictorial language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>

<seg id="1024">Our politicians, the news industry and Hollywood continue to understand.</seg>
<seg id="1025">I've worked in the news industry for thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful, flawed narratives dominate our newsfeeds.</seg>
<seg id="1026">This narrative overshadows the reality that has resulted in nine Muslim women in their countries over the last three decades, while the US could not even vote for its first female candidate.</seg>
<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from carrying their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, both of which are two sides of the same coin.</seg>
<seg id="1028">"" "a powerful group exercises its" "" "control" "" "on the" "" "other" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of Queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has so deeply and flawed our collective imagination that often Sikh men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>
<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is not only fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "others."</seg>
<seg id="1034">To the 1.7 billion belong</seg>
<seg id="1035">In the news industry, we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Or on alternative facts.</seg>

<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the insurmountable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS does not lie on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and honor the variety of languages in large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been carrying out events since 2015, there is the risk that small and not very small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - secure spaces in which residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often linked to understanding," "" "these events are instead" "" "listening to estimating, feeling, socializing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and presentation lead to the fact that the audience gets involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in Dafing language. during this round, the story teller Rassidatou Konate also seizes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamara tells the tale of the hares and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the meaning of his fable, John Nyamara asked:" "" "how is it to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "he shares his sense of inclusiveness with a broad smile:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and organizers hope to extend this. all those inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of re-checking the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, on 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration; the march started at the Puertoriental Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (citizen front for the neural examination of debt) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of re-fixing the debt also submitted a petition to the official home page of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico called for politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for their debts to be held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a firm, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that operates in favor of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and suppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico are refusing to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with declining pension payments.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for freedom and remind of the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director at Book Sprints, a publisher of books completed by so-called 'book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is available royalty-free, contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what the real costs are with which it is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the Adra prison directory in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information whatsoever about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, right away.</seg>
<seg id="1196">To see how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started thinking about their own fates, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of times of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel" had taken on the basis of a command of the military court taken out of his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as an insider of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer in the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more provocative than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the cross of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural styles fuse with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it, embodying this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel has not yet completed this project yet.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overcome when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was already in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabbath, which she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together for one year together on the book.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>

<seg id="1247">Basessel's history is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the 2011 protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">According to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in jail until 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our demand today in the hope that we must do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption-convicted director after release of prison</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger on a corruption case when a government member returned to work in the state machine after half of his sentence was committed to corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison, together with four other defendants, who were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose advice was held by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which rejected the application, there would be no reason for Cambaza to return to his old post, as the company did not pursue disciplinary action after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't call this action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution campaigning for public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we need to know is that even the firm should have initiated a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not initiate appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "revocable":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent person, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been sucked off.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to inflict harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">This is a resounding success!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says, the director does not possess any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that one rewards someone in such a way that has so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks to return to morality and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served solely on the state itself.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey ZeÃºte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remind that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the Samora Machel prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as a sharp, single-cutting and - by the way - prophetic orator.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations was when he asserted that "an ambitious man was capable of everything, including the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">Samora also said: "I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not that way. he changes the tactics but doesn't turn away from his ambitions.</seg>
<seg id="1280">"" "an ambitious man is at the same time criminal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1281">In Twitter the reactions were also negative:</seg>
<seg id="1282">Cambaza was sentenced to 22 years in prison, he was 10 years old and freed.</seg>
<seg id="1283">And today the company, with which he misses monies, puts it under contract again. # AssimvaiOmeuPais - ÑÎ±deductible k. (@ azmal _ Rafik) May 12, 2017</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of eastern Indian origin or generally used as adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">'Kalar 'may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically cause hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts about its use have been censored.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtains).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how he could alleviate his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">"" "the sentence ku la -" "" "healing" "" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different." ""</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were several reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet considers that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytic before releasing all posts that would be suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">"" "Facebook does not delete the word" "" "Kalar" "" "manually." ""</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the nearby words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"" "for example," "" "Kalar Htine" "" "(chair) and" "" "Kalar pae" "" "(column bushings)." ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech will receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to curtail their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all, spreading hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat proved that the censorship of catchwords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternate spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished by the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing contents for 24 hours because the post office "didn't meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against hate speech radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author thought that extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">"" "" "" "Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work." ""</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "it also seems that they have started this without local context or technical support and have banned words such as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "pea curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsely deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they only had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automated censorship caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech, but were removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post states" "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is intended to additionally heat violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine region, where disputes between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for its failure to control the balancing hate speech on its Burmese side.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in terms of context than code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this amendment of the divorce, some members held Hindu and Muslim religious communities in practice, and in May 2016 there was a major public outcry. at that time Brother Harrypersian Maharaj, a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere since that, age does not determine maturity.

<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys under 19 were married in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media moves endeavored to abolish laws on infancy, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped bring about this outcome.</seg>

<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition provoked tension in this uncomplicated matter, and at some point, doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill was adopted against the child marriage - despite 4 Senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent committee, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law.</seg>

<seg id="1357">After the decision was made before the Senate, the draft can now become law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws on children's marriage had finally been changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who held a ministerial post at the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">Turkey has been blocking its popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day, it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to using bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence of the world), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to be blocked, there are now several mirrors (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform put off all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which is not based on the domain name system and makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is, in spite of the legal prohibition, available.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After having heard the news (about the ban on Wikipedia), we all set out to place snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia contents, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also indicated that this step was done regardless of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is just screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrors pages when in the respective country Wikipedia is blocked.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigallii - Global Voices member and staff of Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">In essence, the server keeps sending the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia yourself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with badly positioned motives and well-balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to take a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown just next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to take photographs that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helped him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just felt at home when I suddenly called me Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a phone call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river was a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river damm is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was in and I immediately started to bend the pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aspires to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and wants to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know, for he was already face to face with Tigers:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Bedtime for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the buzzard appeared. he immediately sat down, we see ourselves and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">"" "to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar will place the logo" "" "I click for conservation" "" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) in its photos." ""</seg>
<seg id="1435">However, his passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wild animals is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and usually lived in a tent to shoot pictures of Otters at Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This article was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international collaborative media organisation from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was again published as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women avoid mentioning the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, and fear of consequences should disregard the norm, maintain this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Odisha by a mock tribunal and expelled from her family and the village community after having addressed a married couple with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also is also common among men. however, they have far fewer remittances to fear, if at all which, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel as well as housewives, appeared in a unique club and became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the Campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and advocates the exploitation of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera for seven years on the discovery of practices such as child marriage up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected people, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion was about women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to mention the name of their husbands, is a custom that they all have duly maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceptive, as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply entrenched that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name from now on." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion club with this self-confidence in their luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to get the discussion going.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell her husband's name with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everyone," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini narrates:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she chained only before her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at their names.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received numerous reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said:" "" "Rohini said I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband's husband was less understandable and the situation turned out to be violent.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as wearing the inox-red dot on the forehead that shows the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zin-red dot if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely ceased, but they think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it in some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make a trip at every discus club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example our identities to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected with the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only taken saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most people this is okay, but some wanted a Salem-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants, they didn't dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of debate and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of dress, the morals related to the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled its own pair of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will create it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini affirms the question of whether something has changed in the five months since her first discussion club, that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped talking about the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it still, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothing - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Every one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for abused purposes, concerns the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a series of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month three men were killed in the district of Milton, a few kilometres from the Malawi border.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and a part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently led to the use of the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia visited the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the UN to perform a mission in the South African country in 2016 to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government has developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milton, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hushai Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mortbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, this draws the police of the Republic of Mozambique in view (PRM), which also indicates that a faith existed, according to which the victims had power in mind that the riches were generated.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men have been murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook, Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the blogger poor Snaively who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERNE EIN Mozambique, THE SME embarrassed A country where the people would have shame to demand sex against good marks, and to take sex against good marks, and even take their lives to earn their bread, a country where neither the Albinos nor bald or bald men are hunted for unfaithful purposes or "black magic" that aim to attain fast riches.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, probably just recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced late June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state threat), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto demanding the democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China described Lius case as an" "" "internal matter" "" "and a spokesman said he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China will continue to receive appeals from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or allow him a treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations Related nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exert pressure to facilitate the treatment of Liu abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende have refused to answer questions about Liko's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the transfer of salmon to China, since exports have largely been blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union (EU)</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as she announced in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift up all the restrictions of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They are to meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that Americans "wish him to have the possibility of treating abroad, in so far as it helps him with his recovery."</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced AFP on June 27 that the embassy would ask Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy prompts a furious response from China, with the statement by the State Department that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told me that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of his choice, according to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>

<seg id="1661">On July 7 and 8, Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reuters news agency that China had big concerns about whether the vortex around Liu might overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum China called on China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police ever monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada urges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of speech, and to allow for the exercise of these rights blocked." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where it is needed. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France will eventually accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of continental affairs in Taiwan requested China to release Liu on June 27 and show greater tolerance to those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator, Yu-Mei-nu, from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very worried in an explanation on June 28 at Liu and admitted that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo who signed Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only Singapore political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports that Singapore should be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a duty of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other "normal countries" in view of that, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Once you reach the core of the subject, the good old body turns up again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam were responses to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged appropriate questions with non-answers of a rational way.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the effort to clear that point, provided that he was paid high to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out critics concerning the reviews that you should start reading the entire address of the conference so that you can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequivocal, even if we enjoy free and just elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the US (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades to win?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "as he said," "" "Be not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what expects me - be I with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes this is right and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "did Mr. Shanmugam" "" "credulously commit a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian advocates?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, in which country go the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the cabinet's cabinet, the statements made by Mr Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">According to the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many Singaporean...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>

<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island nation.</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification mostly follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians probably cook inwardly with anger if they are kept for Americans, but that doesn't bother me.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1768">First: to be called "nice" is basically to be spooky - just like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "Simpsons" (who has one's own Canadian double boarders).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, that would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing to face.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and not worthy of any attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a main characteristic of the Canadians.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that parodies the Junta, which took power in 2014 and, in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to rule the country.</seg>

<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the videos that relate to some of the political topics Thailand has insisted on in the past three years.</seg>

<seg id="1796">One of the problems that the junta continues to pursue is to buy expensive U-boats, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before placing them in an internment camp, another problem.</seg>

<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, East Asia, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together in the Soviet area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and chases live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">In the pre-war period more than 10,000 people lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district has been 16,000 people after having barely climbed over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 some 43,000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillenframe and gold-colored ear rings in teddy bear form.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapacherand grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians, who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the nights sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and metal beds.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - however, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, says Ms RamÃ­rez, people come in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa? "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At present, it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also have slept outside on boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys drugs that they cannot pay, she massages them with a balm the feet exhausted by the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"" "" "" "yes, yes," "" "he answers with a smile." "" "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women." ""</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the cordiality of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">The family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa. "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti.</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that the Africans talk about Mrs. RamÃ­rez already on Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil in advance and worked as a construction worker on the construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup Championship.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Ms. RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he said, smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez says that her guests often send her text messages when they left to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"" "" "" "this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house." ""</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has started helping them to get a reasonable price, then he has offered them his house for one dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After he lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, single educator, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go next steps.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors the traveler quietly consult their telephones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother, she leaves her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one her daughter with African hair spots, which she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she introduces her to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya's fueron," she repeats her every time. "they have gone on."</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi have received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the communication, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities used the app to use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they had installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the notification of the police that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This App with filtering for minors will help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While notifications of digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the East and South, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict zones, the authorities often order extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"images from mainland China" based on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police checked the residents indiscriminately if they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are discovered on a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are thought for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the training technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" also published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus receive unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government departments, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office to operate their computers and communications equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on June 27 in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" registered at local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of the indigenous people of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he strolls to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and back to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the highest level of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyees (for example: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist facing the conservative majority and questioning its old-established views on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed music.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only relevant in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited in his thinking by borders, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not openly admit it, he is against the American foreign policy a special reluctance.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian refugee of the second generation," he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so, because of my own circumstances," "" "said Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man" "", "while he poured a NescafÃ© in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan. during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that eating food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, having a cup of coffee at a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the pieces of lukewarm coffee and the waisters of the Kent-cigarette in the nose speak primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look into neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during Ramadan, to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of the Interior of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic campaign - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that Hamas's sexual orientation contradicts Hamed Sinno, the country's cultural and traditional norms, and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said in an interview with CNN that the concert was "straight" cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tried legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila valued the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to choose "intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should not be simply rhetoric, but in fact reflected a more and more clearly crystallized reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib held back traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who premarted sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an apparently low-trodden unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those they really should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"" "in the past few years, the number of" "" "honour killings" "" "has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside." ""</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of genocides in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of family violence can "detained indefinitely" and for their release it is often necessary to have years of bureaucratic expenditures and family guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Even Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is well known not to shy away from topics that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "I have been informed about politics," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib occupies the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "", "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are at the core politically can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib published a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse repeats quite often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is also." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words, "can get what you want" - be it belief or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbian people and that comments on gender equality have been strongly censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya in order to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and reviewed in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed was only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib acquires open for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not disagree with Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuovo, a poet of the eighth century, still alive today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuova, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliphs, could write openly about homosexuality in the 8th century, why can Jordanians not do that?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemian Kingdom, there is nothing new that the government sanctifies attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took several former members of the government and members of the teacher's association, arguing that they were critical of the problems associated with corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it sees Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing up his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificial kinds of democracies. at least he hopes this.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebrasa festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is thought that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the solid carriages, the drums and dancing were passed over more than one thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebrascal Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 meter high fort was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Seldom outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and to promote a legitimate profession as the hair course.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, near the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street raub and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 shows that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) have led to the fact that more and more normal citizens move into the hands of hairdressers that can recreate these complex hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the dressage competition "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts will compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions like the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and instead of poor advice to get an education in the hairdressing art that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March, and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because from love to the children we have built this educational community.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea AfterTwelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel ejected?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly how the young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Bogotic Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation inspired them to write letters to the campaign Carta por la-liaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation), encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently was their country the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their share: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The International was considered so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal detention for many years and were exposed to war rhetoric and carrying weapons around the clock must now integrate themselves into living as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, must now enter its ranks and support them in the establishment of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"" "" "" "Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians must unite and help in the integration process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: so far thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation arose at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most pressing response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was created to write letters full of hope and support for former warriors of the FARC which must now find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'I never thought anyone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camp in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotic Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC have set themselves up as they had done before to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in-between," said the political science student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because next to him on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "but I asked him," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him tightly and placed me beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, so sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the beginning, students and some leaders of the FARC were joined by a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already war and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">This is why the leaders of the FARC have explained the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice worked from the state to the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the possibility of developing ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society in this country more just.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear these people who had never heard a hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would rule after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to take arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">We of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - regardless of race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, for we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles along our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2260">After that, the photos from my documents made the lap through WhatsApp.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">When I was about to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying: "here's a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long will you still dishonour the family, you scandal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had all got along and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung wing.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which patient's wings were you placed - in the men or women of the women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it, but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">I received threats last February.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They set up absurd requirements: some said to me, I must prove it by running through the streets above; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grozny and say that I had not changed my sex that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have cup size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to cope with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with darkened windows and a number plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For safety reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before my departure from Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering, without reference, without anything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in to the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I received a message: "you don't think you're in security, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you're stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "only to prove it to you, it is number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo topic.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really try to figure out how the person looks at them from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who are dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who spent one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told us that during Ramadan there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not lock up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and in the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still gay men captured in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says that there were just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"" "" "" "if, then especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows" "" "court" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now only a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now, however, they were not introduced as bandits, but there were no reports about it so far. we suspect that such actions are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already happened in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already in the whole of Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the seriousness of life!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when the Sharia was applied, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than it is now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "" "" "Russia wanted to lead us to" "" "civilisation" "", "but finally dropped us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had tinted lashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Sharia Security Department has never bent my hair on me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theater in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "carrot is not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says it to children, when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not speak about us per se, but primarily about women's behaviour.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could sense how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time, I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I'm still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend any cents for this.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I rattled some kind of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to familiarise you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestan have which, the Cabins have which, the Russians have also what; on the whole planet there is it - but "not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Know, many think of transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm going to be so personally, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there has been a strong surge of suicides.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-incineration of a man called Jassim Moramazi on August 27, the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is characterised by poverty and unemployment, is rampant.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video divided on YouTube kept the moments after he had lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - were hanged.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patriots who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region, which is a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses the Ahwazi-Arabs to work in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that divert water from the Arab areas into the Persian areas where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi youths now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director of cooperatives, work and social welfare reported that 5% of Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% a secondary school, and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" of the number of suicides among young Ahwazi men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians arriving in Ahwaz and anti-Arab discrimination in the setting process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not prefer to recruit Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living out of their homeland, Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last names to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists kill an alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking notice of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is avoidable.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women - who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put through well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should be feminine in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, in spite of the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms continue to ensure that women come across a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on sex still stretches across the many different countries and faiths.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, when I come to talk on skin color, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or black women from the Diaspora; when I mention how we have always been abused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and out of the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "exalt their voices and sing" Kumbaya, my Lord, "to achieve equality (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that there is an institutionalised form of racist violence in addition to sexualised violence, which we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or, that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all the women, all men and all men of all skin colour to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman I cannot join a movement whose centre is the white woman who refuses to consider inequalities in her thinking, which refer to both sex and skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminized-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"" "sojourner complained in her speech in 1851:" "" "am I not a woman?" "" "and also I refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical perspective, a marginalized and marginalized being." ""</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to reveal white women the importance of overlap of skin color and gender. for some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women from different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" still lies in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself wholeheartedly from feminism and join the Movement of Womanism, which was launched for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of defending myself for a white-feminized paradigm that is so obstinate that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming: (about: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they can be completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately cry out separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift up black women and women from other cultures because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and due to my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither ignored, nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A Police Commissioner Ada BÃ¡ez said that she could not do anything against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be placed on the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena for maltreatment, Ada BÃ¡ez's informed ad did not use anything.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">It is difficult to break the vicious circle of violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women are reporting an advert at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse it. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must be reported to the law enforcement agencies.</seg>

<seg id="2491">The available numbers, however, are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 AD reported cases of domestic violence in the District Attorney Office. 70% of them were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence at the Peace Courts. 86% of women's ads came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women claimed that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown. "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not do this.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse," "" "she explained at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's suicide is not an individual criminal offense in Paraguay, law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women each year are murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to her estimates, every ten days a woman dies in Paraguay because of violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want that, but after that she gave up. this should always regret her.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence in turn - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought that I would be a victim of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that it only happened women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote posts on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people answered their contributions, among them Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against her and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had left Carlos for so long and didn't leave him before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain blame on it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all in some way victim of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case everything started with mental maltreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he started beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's advertisements with the authorities stayed without result and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a trial against her former partner, who developed into a non-manageable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of their former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a draft bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# fÃ¼rth).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMinos (# Non Sequential) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="2532">"" "" "" "thus the legal text was changed in some respects to also win the MPs" "" "for the law, which advocated that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions is in principle banned in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years in prison." ""</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill of law stipulated that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence have to bear at the present time, if they simply want to report on display and would like to receive a secure accommodation, impose on the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of inter-human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here, a rethink must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Who is silent in the face of these facts, complicates himself and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators get away without offense.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to report as long as abuse is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, a passage was cancelled, calling the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconcile.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes go apart.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, illustration takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, many medicines and vaccines are missing in the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe effects in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research into these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, research carried out by African scientists helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">It grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at Pennsylvania University, he researched the HIV virus himself before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health care system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warriers RW: at present, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">That has to change, otherwise we will always remain receivers, rather than being a maker yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GM: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What obstacles are there in your routine research work you didn't have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, health care (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to western countries, based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system means that magazines can only make articles available for payment (the so-called" "" "paywall" "" "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This article by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding lettuce in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredgeous, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was set by its own imagination and the question of how many types of salad he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that it could not be used for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents applied not only to individual varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green or curled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or carrots. because of this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts take care of food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding lettuce, but in the meantime he needs longer because his work is increasingly difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if there is a boulder in a river that I have to pack." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go too far for salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand in court, no one can breed a new kind of lettuce, because all the features are already patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very cautious and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is growing ever larger in the US and anywhere in the world: open source Breeding (Open Source Breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts at the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Roman lettuce of the Outrageous variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds more like the move from the IT area and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source seed) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and are thus permanently usable for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US farmers can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open source" breeders only allow others who purchase their seed to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">According to him seed, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seeds," says he and takes care of the increasingly frequent mergers in the global agricultural industry. "whoever wants to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, as it is farmed in farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seeds is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to ensuring that other seed remains freely available to others, as opposed to patent seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is always available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in his doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are no such estimates for other plants, but experts like Luby suspect that mass-grown crops such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown so that they exhibit specific desired traits - from those by which their taste or color improves up to those in which they thrive in certain environments and can withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant characteristics indicate that the available plant material for breeders takes more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary at present than ever since the changed conditions are much worse predicted by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, as "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not prevent innovation, but it promotes it by providing more material and know-how to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait until a patent expels, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to be able to breed crops adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">The main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders do not have the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want farmers to make their work easier." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us, and it will be made impossible if we can't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">All in all, Morton is bothered by the concept of patented plant traits: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi-Board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "whoever breeds a variety, also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Whoever believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass herbicides are needed, breeds this concept of agriculture in its varieties.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is very opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (those who move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto are) patents, they create most smaller seed companies even without patents - either they reject the patenting or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is searching for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative through the elimination of plant patents: "it looks like I am stronger than companies that patent it with my efforts to produce something new.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my grades for a few years, "he says." with a patent for 20 years, one is protected from competition, which makes it easy for me to think. "worldwide resonance</seg>
<seg id="2683">While the US seems to be a leader in open-source breeding, the concept spreads quickly around the world.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human Rights Organization and Blog are the latest censorship targets in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities are still blocking content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend around the 5th of August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI) which documents and reports human rights abuses in Egypt and the Arab world.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities sharply criticized this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights is permanent despite this attack and the contempt of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law to expose and give victims a voice. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as it is now. ANHRI confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the barriers and not give up.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, the Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar office of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human Rights Organization of the wave of site barriers to victims. @ anhri one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">Besides ANHRI, the blog of columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of articles and articles he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government itself was the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider with whom also Zickadas blog is located, on the other hand is more accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while reporting on the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada commented on the government's blocking and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It was possible for them to convey me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, unloading at the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs, and any other web page I was working for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to bypass censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, having locked him up and that they are afraid of words, I still can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities locked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Also documented the blocking of providers by bypassing internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs started.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censoring decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis, by which it can proceed to court against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army deployed in the favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in all Brazil are reporting with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is assassinated," "Thieves robben Pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and airportee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and a tense financial situation in 2017, the wave of violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "known for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio published the Editorial" "" "This is not normal" "" "in which she announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio is published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a 4 minute video divided on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a newspaper tells a newspaper that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organizations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the paper continues:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise atrocities of the police that only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it uses?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence is a "war." this is, in her opinion, a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">In memory: Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. published courtesy of Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is wrong, according to CecÃ­lia: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the latest available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities are located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the murders in the state, Rio is in number 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, like CecÃ­lia, has been emphasizing the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by using a massive police facility and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this did indeed lead to a decline in violent deaths. for a number of years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria established by the Geneva Convention on the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also causes grave consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls for the state to use resources and means typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">The fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week ago that the police came up the mountain with the Favela Jacarezinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities have suffered brutal attacks and blockades, mainly due to the Assad regime over loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians living in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding lands, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 demanded hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel areas have been besieged by rebel areas outside Damascus, causing inhabitants to rely on locally produced or tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockade, traditional foods, such as meat, have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to AFP, the French news agency:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we decided to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because you can plant them in houses and basements." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been fighting for three years to announce this project and expressed his relief that it is gaining recognition more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the planting of mushrooms, according to Dr. Leila, Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo by Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said global Voices that they started producing fungal seeds from the regions before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many districts of Portugal on 21 October, demanding justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal last week.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of October 15 and 16, which caused the government to call for a state shower last week out of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where fires caused 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest monitoring system, which supervises forest areas via satellite photographs, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of slightly inflammable wood, spread like in a vicious circle, after fires of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Protection Agency of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when citizens sought information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to people with information: using the application foster.pt, it made use of its own civilian protection data and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina in order to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the server did not withstand the rush of 400,000 users who followed the fires.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hezb-e-Wahdat party dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara were suddenly defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara forsook the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his flight, Ashark found herself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was difficult and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage, and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars who were heavier than himself to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharper remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site, on which we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service there and no heating. we hung Nylon in front of the open windows, so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without documents in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum request, Ashark came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Ashark was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high coverage ratios, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions involving asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in the more than 3000" "" "special reception centres," "" "they are improvised centres in the hands of unqualified and unbiased personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which after the registration of the asylum application can still go for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who don't have money for accommodation are either relying on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">That's how it took Asharper.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unjust life-game helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">Having worked in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian Luxury - one Hazara in Italy") of the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">In 2017, the film received the Venice City Award, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A great deal of bureaucracy, high taxes and loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, approximately 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some of Afghan companies have emerged, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants have even been praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Oriental Experience restaurant in which the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also have Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharqi's goals go far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retail, and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are possibilities," says Asharper with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "Asharaf also plans to establish a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their food surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end, stability and prosperity are at the end.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Now he wants to help other Afghans on their way.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the overthrow of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>

<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen-Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook just after registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">In order to be able to use social networks, users must register within six months of the regulatory decision on the authority's website stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who miss this step could be sentenced to up to six months "imprisonment or a penal payment.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty members of Parliament, is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "may another MP filed a bill of law to be implemented in the tougher punishments for insulting the president or high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law proposition, however, such a crime would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he was demonstrating violence against protesters who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the removal of elected president Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, like more than 700 participants arrested during the same incident, four years in prison for a date of trial.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May because the prison management failed according to human rights groups to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatened with death penalty due to the fact that many human rights groups agree that there is a pseudo burden including holding hands, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a Criminal Court in Giza cleared the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mossad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the sentences of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogated Tunisian activists on sifted documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours questioning Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat as well as the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was chiefly questioned by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly endorsed a controversial bill of law, which would guarantee the businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali the corruption accused officers of amnesty if they return all unlawful received monies.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on April 21 on the Nawaat website sheds light on how the presidential plans look to support the legal situation.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected his sources as part of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which grants journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared at the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to demonstrate their identity?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Government Council of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the Regulations it is also stated that registration will be necessary with full real name.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that the elimination of anonymous comments in social networks is to be achieved. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have suggested in the social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as" "" "organizer of the information distribution" "" "in the provincial government." ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a 2014 law thanks to which the Russian government carries out a list of online services that organize the "publication of information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for removing contents and forcing them on request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These websites currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnogorniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, the email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the Wikipedias in Turkey after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the information that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">The Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was closed because it became "an information source that collaborates with groups to instigate a political diffusion campaign against Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time that Turkey completely blocks the website. it is thus, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop to carve around</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week's documents, the UK government is located in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased security powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and to install software programs that decode data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunication companies and intelligence services on the proposal but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
