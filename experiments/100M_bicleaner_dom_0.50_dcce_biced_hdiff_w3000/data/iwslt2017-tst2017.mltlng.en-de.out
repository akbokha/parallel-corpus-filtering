this is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times re@@ porter .
long before anyone heard about Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a disa@@ strous US intelligence operation in which the CIA handed Iran literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has determined against Ris@@ en and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Senate , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ te they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to prison .
so from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en lived with the risk of going to jail .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
all of a sudden , although they said for years that it was essential to their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped .
the reason : in the era of electronic monitoring , re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of trying to crack and crack the statements , it could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , were secretly concerned with his telephone inquiries ,
just like his email data , finance and bank information , his loan agreement , and even travel references with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA @-@ W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s alleged source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments together .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article about national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower coming to a journalist .
so we put forward the press work , which is to be protected by the first constitutional proposition because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can use technologies to better protect their sources .
and indeed they can accept that from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there are communications software that has not yet been ris@@ king his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet celeb@@ r@@ ity , the former Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news website , such as the Washington Post here .
there you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access to .
so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset .
however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se all of us .
it is important to us to ensure that not only technology men such as Edward Snow@@ den have a way to do wrong off@@ ences . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about ab@@ norm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers who alarm the polluted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der that warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak in history has been published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Pap@@ ers &apos; reveal that emp@@ ires and wealthy &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has mail@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is claimed that a trace of US $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist .
now there will be a lot of rich people and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now this sounds like the plot of an agency spy or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that happen to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that concerns all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
throughout the world media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are being used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people make this whole world very conf@@ using , and it is difficult to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a mat@@ ry@@ osh@@ ka soup .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
probably because there were no prominent Americans until now , who in these revelations came forward to this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands , or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some US countries you need less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator retired as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shocked ourselves that all up to one of our lawyers made suggestions on how to transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to manage this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
this may sound tri@@ vial as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as though there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have seen clas@@ hes with greater transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the United States is behind .
representatives of both parties have dra@@ fted a draft bill in both chambers of parliament , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use to end this kind of in@@ transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally put an end to the in@@ transparency which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story that I once almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made an end @-@ to @-@ end sales .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . then he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he excit@@ edly told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
what am I doing now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; eh , how ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I get stuck in there ?
a stranger is sleeping in my living room .
what if he &apos;s mad ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed , sne@@ aking at the toes to the door , and my bedroom door closed .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
hosting people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a time jump , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I am sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ettes are completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that at the same time we were able to find new friends and pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept .
thus we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publish images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting .
through the Internet , they can invite strangers to spend the night in them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
nobody who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you concentrate on things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I want to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your un@@ locked phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this soft touch of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who is actually Al G@@ ores mobile ?
could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had imagined it once with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine that you had 150 testim@@ onies , all of which say : &quot; he can really hold onto very well @-@ designed cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ through feedback system makes the confidence decisive .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for the people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
finally , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust the people most closely to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by assessments .
if you have less than three app@@ rais@@ als , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation stems from com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , for example &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you will get no answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one can tell too much , as for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; Great art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m going on vacation with my family . &quot;
how to create it with design to create this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to take away these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a need not covered before .
for us the business is going very well .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who did not celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated flats .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front when trust broke out .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts already when I just think about it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem .
for people have confidence in one another .
if trust works , won@@ dro@@ us can arise .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his evaluation :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to have heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels that save life even though they don &apos;t know one .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by .
they let you stay longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , not every stay doesn &apos;t work .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
this is an economical trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not just the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel today , you can compare it with fast food . it &apos;s efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you visited , a group of locals would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which you have never heard of ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
today , flats are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities were to adopt the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital , Seoul . many car parks belonging to the government ,
students who were looking for a place to stay , were now offered to residents .
were taught to people whose children were und@@ ressed . In@@ cub@@ ator programs were launched ,
in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy , 7@@ 8@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host today through our platform alone .
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
there was also a warm hospitality .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find it amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
of course we know that design can &apos;t solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the backup check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a w@@ ann@@ abe @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ten myself .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist girl@@ friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , and against the pressure that I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
I read it , thought , posed in question , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow surrender which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever had the feeling that someone is perc@@ ei@@ ving you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should I do something like that ?
I changed the TV channel and listened : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... , ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , &quot; &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... destro@@ ys Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u the acts of others turned me into susp@@ ects from a citizen .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start the post@@ graduate studies .
I remember how I went -- when we were silent -- so deep it went down into my seat , and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said , &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well @-@ lighted areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mo@@ b yourselves . &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings continued : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims , dra@@ gged and killed .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something didn &apos;t feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got the people &apos;s anger on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain oneself .
I have nothing against any questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA .
there is only one question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
Muslims , like all other Americans , are not a tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic Games .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there might be some parking spaces , but not stopping the terror .
regular visits to a mos@@ que cause people to consider other fai@@ ths more tolerant and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , D.@@ C. recently said : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radi@@ cal@@ isation , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts might make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or a beli@@ ever .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would put ourselves into their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ K@@ lux Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups asser@@ t their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when you take a look at them , they don &apos;t drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had preferred to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her anger , she was a main target for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m re@@ established the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que forbi@@ d them to join the IS .
that was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian government system , conformity , and prejudi@@ ces .
a study shows : when people submit news reports , in which negative is reported about Muslims , they vo@@ iced rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just an academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims f@@ lowed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we might feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when assign@@ ing collective guilt it is not only about having to explain oneself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an athlete .
he was talented at the dental faculty , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when was such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or Raz@@ an who was visiting the afternoon .
he shot on De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism may not only be im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we wanted to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely ex@@ ert our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we ro@@ de in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had taken courage and compassion toward panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble think factory , that is an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I am perfectly normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as allowed .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the biggest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people like an exception appear to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about becoming a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air pack@@ et delivery to our social consciousness penet@@ rated , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience . some years ago , they started flying with ropes .
by inter@@ connecting , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
they can also build resili@@ ent structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available on the highest level , e. g . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter ,
a flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
unlike most of the star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like gu@@ sts .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . thank you .
during our research , we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the heart of the matter .
one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mo@@ ve@@ able parts coming together to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled aircraft that only had two mov@@ able parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one thing works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ho@@ ist , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently .
it has only a mov@@ able part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ ders , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechan@@ ically simple , very much happens inside the inner life so that it can fly st@@ ably , and move everywhere in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right is minimal , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the Moon is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
as a result , it receives the exceptional skill ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even as it rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some are available in models , the rest is directly learned when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller turns out , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , albeit limited .
we will demonstrate this by making half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration uses synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the extra safe press on the side of Broadway wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , intelligent creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other faster and faster in a very distant gal@@ axy . they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they ligh@@ tened bri@@ ghtly than all stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let &apos;s rank the events at first in time .
1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth .
since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most people considered it crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational waves observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved the detection performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes scre@@ wed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the departure from my death @-@ sick father .
that was basically the fruits of my life .
all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT .
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pple in the structure of space and time .
when the wave is over@@ hau@@ led , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction , and the other is packed into the other .
in the course of the theory of rel@@ ativity , lec@@ turers often lead a real silver dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14th , for example , each of us was stretched and stretched when the waves were hit . the average man &apos;s stretch was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . therefore , one declared the Lig@@ o employees crazy .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be measured in less than one thous@@ and@@ th of a nucle@@ us of a nuclear nucle@@ us . this is grot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text on gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this in 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone .
this is quite practical , because you can create an image or a map of things by picking the light around you from several points .
it is different with sounds .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
the face of your child for example .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now I &apos;m talking about Alice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob dis@@ covers them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by looking at changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave pattern into sound , we can hear the universe literally .
the gra@@ vit@@ ation to listen , can reveal about a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , circular : w@@ up@@ p !
rotate the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary that shapes the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; No one who knows what to hear , recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ times solar mass , which turn around as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 prob@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve one hundred times per second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can -- virtually or basically -- do not see .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super nov@@ as .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon , and silicon .
we will never look through as these are opa@@ que .
the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own tail light .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly : I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt which we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , as Lig@@ o ob@@ serves them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are so to speak , the no@@ d@@ ules for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o offers us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as brave as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ cus of the universe .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say to all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to talk to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety - pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected kind . it began with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for un@@ explained reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I was upset to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I am going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very tired .
it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I &apos;m the author . I think things get out of mind , catch them to life .
dream job .
no .
I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV season I am responsible for putting aside 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode , every nine days , four shows , every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows simultaneously in production : 24 episodes : grey &apos;s , 21 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
$ 350 million for one season .
in America , my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who else does it ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you that all of you who work so hard , whether you are going to run a company , a country or a class room , take a business or a household , take me seriously when I talk about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just hanging around on the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not about dream job .
it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
so as if you wear a high note , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing about it is the tot@@ als .
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people stop when I explain the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the tot@@ als -- when I started to work and work and to make , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the tot@@ als !
the sum is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can no different look for size .
the feeling of not being able to do differently than to strive for size , no matter what price .
this is called sums .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
maybe it &apos;s genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the tot@@ als .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I must work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love the tot@@ als .
I need the sums . I am the sum .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ stated , burned out .
the bu@@ zz stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their m@@ um is a single work title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ anic .
they are baby ti@@ ters .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the engine bu@@ zz stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as usual : the same Tit@@ anic work , 15 hours @-@ day , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with all the heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no money .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the tot@@ als I was .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some might think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hypo@@ cris@@ y , stupid Author Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do what you do , you do what you are doing , being a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mo@@ m , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz if you know the bu@@ zz , and knows how the bu@@ zz feels when you stop the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; south @-@ state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I already want to say no , when two things are made aware of me :
first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she doesn &apos;t call anybody any more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did it happen ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about this .
we play with her sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding , because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of the sum , I can do nothing but watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I create is the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens , it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is coming back slowly .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it is there .
not the tot@@ als , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium dioxide , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sums are no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the tot@@ als are the electricity that comes from the z@@ est of life .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any debt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the h@@ um again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t really like playing as they work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful because what a person prefers to be rather than home ?
well , I do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
none of it is that I am too relaxed .
we rage around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always take care of my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe meet me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else .
it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaced me .
and speak my teen@@ age daughter whole 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no more need .
everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to finish .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my delight , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the tot@@ als , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
to play in general .
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you &apos;re doing well .
find out and store it yourself .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I &apos;ll win . meeting friends , reading books , enjoying the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a piece , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months , a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the hum@@ ming is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that &apos;s my bu@@ zz .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it &apos;s sn@@ app@@ y that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem plays .
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the tot@@ als . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the screens , the sums , the sums , the other , the real bu@@ zz : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , lasting , bare and new feeling of being in me is wide . less titanium -- more I !
the more I feel this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am a writer . I think things happen , I stir you to life .
that is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve nerve functions by different surgical procedures .
they certainly have one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; thereby , one im@@ planted an electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life you have to reduce the internal pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes have to remove some s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right nutrition , temperature , humidity and the surroundings to thri@@ ve .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology instruction that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
so we saw a new strange cell population that looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ mis@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our brain cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear , however -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and they then highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
in the last step , we reim@@ proved them from the point of view of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we reim@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we reim@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler &apos;s help , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we reim@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we made an injury and reim@@ planted the same cells and now the cells remained . they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we were able to see under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ able .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we color in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable level of skill , we hurt the motor @-@ motor area in the motor cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ sed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance prior to injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
now see when we reim@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the stimulation of the rice .
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too .
since that time , we have fi@@ gured out a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
Bruno Luigi : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting with these great results , you have to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue looking into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ entre study .
you first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy is the key to democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them self @-@ evident .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it as un@@ changing ge@@ aring .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his big im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ ber friends who told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group , are mistaken , we could save democracy but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are bri@@ bed , our future glo@@ omy and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the topic of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin peaks parad@@ ox &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , who th@@ rows his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which is part of the wealthy savers and corporations , who are too anxious to invest in places where it would be productive and income , with which one could reduce the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past three months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
the $ 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollar sounds after a lot of money until you compare it with the $ 5.1 billion that at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and sell real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low demand for macro@@ economic demand , which , as in a final loop , promotes the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors in which they do not invest .
un@@ consciously bring about the circumstances that lead to the killing of O@@ edi@@ pus .
this is my Ha@@ des with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
its very wast@@ eful art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy , of course , closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
however , it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it occupied the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , that they admitted to them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same voice @-@ wei@@ ghting in questions of the state &apos;s bel@@ ong@@ ings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted too long -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
like a candle , which shines bri@@ ghtly , it is also quickly burned out .
however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was narrow@@ ed to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our present @-@ day demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , an im@@ plac@@ able struggle between the two takes place , by gradually sub@@ stit@@ uting politics and escap@@ ing them .
wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power because the power has mig@@ rated from politics to the economy and the divisions are separated .
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they nour@@ ish themselves , that they end up star@@ ving at the end .
the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being exploited , the ine@@ quality increases , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managing directors of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; from democracy , the higher are the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour @-@ power and the prosperity of humanity .
if that is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , like in ancient Athens , except for exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers by autom@@ ating and robots .
the problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts go deeper , as it -- very soon , as I believe -- will come in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ se the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary .
so the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines serve people and people put their energy into research into the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ ener &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples .
in the area of the company : please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all the in@@ comes of capital and revenues come from and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the companies , but who do not work therein , and employees working there , but the company does not belong there . no more pi@@ geon more between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency backed by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging markets &#93; , in the interests of all of humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency - we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country , into a mutual fund .
imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re @-@ united politics and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it prefers privileged people , and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Luigi : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... What we do not do , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , meaning Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as a &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise not only our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
as Ha@@ ye@@ k , I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also perfect .
BG : actually , and now we are well .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the or@@ ator you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it is played -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I may say this as pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is now similar to England of the 19th century .
because -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is an error , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now to repro@@ ach China for doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I thought that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that is to say good @-@ bye to ourselves and the continual denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the euro@@ zone , have still chosen denial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when change happens it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : everyday .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the credi@@ tors &apos; side to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they merely wanted to bring our government to a halt , only because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that passed through the euro zone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they had been going through a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you still seem to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the road of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it seems to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of the Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you will be wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Braun most of them have never heard before , although he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for so many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the Amazon TV production company .
he is 47 years old , slim , has an im@@ perfec@@ tion@@ ist and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he &apos;s responsible for finding the shows and the content Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this bend .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review will get .
if your show is valued at nine and above , it is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Braun is not about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he gets more thoughts about the mean bul@@ lying , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not exc@@ ite .
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs a guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and votes through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon gives things out for nothing , do you resort to , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows .
they are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pping or watching again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and get the answer , and it reads : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com above four repub@@ li@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show with data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it a bit differently .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they took a risk and decided not to make a sit@@ com above four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
we have two very competitive , data @-@ driven companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this about ?
because the logic says somehow that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you meet , then you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
does anybody know the multi @-@ health system here ?
nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in jail in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong .
yes , even Google may make mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that data analysis can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success was cul@@ min@@ ating in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the journal Nature .
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life - at work , in legal enforcement , in medicine .
so we prefer to make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people are using uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the items together again in order to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , when they voted &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data starts to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to not forget it , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there were data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will fight it later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
so maybe the ball becomes wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
