<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard about Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA handed Iran literally drafts for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Senate, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to use this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the mute they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had already done before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">So from 2007 to 2015 Risen lived with the risk of going to jail.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">All of a sudden, although they said for years that it was essential to their case, the government's demands were dropped.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the era of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of trying to crack and crack the statements, it could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, were secretly concerned with his telephone inquiries,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his email data, finance and bank information, his loan agreement, and even travel references with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA-Whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments together.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article about national security has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put forward the press work, which is to be protected by the first constitutional proposition because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And indeed they can accept that from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communications software that has not yet been risking his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet celebrity, the former Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news website, such as the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server that only the respective news agency has access to.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information it would require would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that jeopardise all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important to us to ensure that not only technology men such as Edward Snowden have a way to do wrong offences. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers and wants to report from overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers who alarm the polluted water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the biggest data leak in history has been published.] [the Panama Papers' reveal that empires and wealthy] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has mailbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is claimed that a trace of US $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now this sounds like the plot of an agency spy or a John Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Throughout the world media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, are being used by a few to hide and obscure their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people make this whole world very confusing, and it is difficult to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoshka soup.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these formations.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were no prominent Americans until now, who in these revelations came forward to this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But due to the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands, or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some US countries you need less information to provide less information to form a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator retired as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked ourselves that all up to one of our lawyers made suggestions on how to transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who submitted proposals to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politician involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to manage this, we need to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">This may sound trivial as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had ever changed; as though there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist, I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"" "" "" "over the past few years, we have seen clashes with greater transparency regarding the owners of companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has gathered in central registers on a national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the United States is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have drafted a draft bill in both chambers of parliament, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness, this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use to end this kind of intransparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally put an end to the intransparency which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story that I once almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after finishing my design studies, I made an end-to-end sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. then he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he excitedly told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse," "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I doing now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard:" "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "eh, how?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! what did I get stuck in there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's mad? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed, sneaking at the toes to the door, and my bedroom door closed.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work that he had bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in my childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">Hosting people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a time jump, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure our cheese ham omelettes are completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we were able to find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented to investors: "we want to create a website where people publish images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting.</seg>
<seg id="139">Through the Internet, they can invite strangers to spend the night in them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in solace would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all have learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you concentrate on things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we had learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I want to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your unlocked phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This soft touch of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who is actually Al Gores mobile?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please announce on Twitter that he is candidate for the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had imagined it once with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine that you had 150 testimonies, all of which say: "he can really hold onto very well-designed cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-through feedback system makes the confidence decisive.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for the people to surrender negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">Finally, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust the people most closely to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's call -- in our case by assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three appraisals, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">In addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get away from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, for example" "" "Hi!" "", "you will get no answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "one can tell too much, as for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, for example "Great art works in your apartment! I'm going on vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to create this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to take away these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business is going very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who did not celebrate parties or have devastated flats.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front when trust broke out.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts already when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have confidence in one another.</seg>
<seg id="210">If trust works, wondrous can arise.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay where he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his evaluation:</seg>
<seg id="215">"" "" "" "perfect home for travelers who tend to have heart attacks because of sitting activities." ""</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels that save life even though they don't know one.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by.</seg>
<seg id="220">They let you stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">Of course, not every stay doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economical trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it's not just the" "" "rental industry" "" "that is not just the case." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel today, you can compare it with fast food. it's efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you visited, a group of locals would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a quarter of which you have never heard of;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Today, flats are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities were to adopt the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that make society and relationships possible, instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korea's capital, Seoul. many car parks belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Students who were looking for a place to stay, were now offered to residents.</seg>
<seg id="241">Were taught to people whose children were undressed. Incubator programs were launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">In order to finance new start-ups in the share economy, 78,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or even host today through our platform alone.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also a warm hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">Of course we know that design can't solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the backup check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A wannabe-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I decided to outen myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist girlfriends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was: at that time it was a declaration of independence for me, and against the pressure that I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, posed in question, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow surrender which deepened with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Have you ever had the feeling that someone is perceiving you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?</seg>
<seg id="287">That's how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian American Dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were.</seg>
<seg id="292">"" "I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" "" "Breaking News" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I changed the TV channel and listened:... "Muslim terrorists...,..." in the name of Islam... "..." Jihad..., "" Jihad... "... destroys Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country was attacked, but in the Nu the acts of others turned me into suspects from a citizen.</seg>
<seg id="302">On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start the postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember how I went -- when we were silent -- so deep it went down into my seat, and I was the first time afraid to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">And then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations who said, "Be vigilant," "Be careful," "Abide in well-lighted areas," "Don't mob yourselves."</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed indoors the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings continued:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard from attacks on Muslims or from people who were considered Muslims, dragged and killed.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something didn't feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I've got the people's anger on the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against any questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today we can actually hear people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only one question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There might be some parking spaces, but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque cause people to consider other faiths more tolerant and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, D.C. recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation, one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremists might make a brainwashing, which leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or a believer.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would put ourselves into their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam, like the Ku-Klux Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups assert their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but when you take a look at them, they don't drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had preferred to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, silence and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that had made sense to her anger, she was a main target for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam reestablished the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque forbid them to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">That was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian government system, conformity, and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows: when people submit news reports, in which negative is reported about Muslims, they voiced rather military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood against Muslims flowed upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">"" "" "" "it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens." ""</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We might feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us.</seg>

<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the dental faculty, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism may not only be immoral, but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we wanted to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exert our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we rode in silence, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had taken courage and compassion toward panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble think factory, that is an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say, don't deceive. I am perfectly normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am not an exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When you look at the Muslims around the world, and I did that with the biggest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world, people want normal things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So I am in no way an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">When people like an exception appear to rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>

<seg id="407">What started as a platform for hobbyists is about becoming a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air packet delivery to our social consciousness penetrated, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks live in front of the audience. some years ago, they started flying with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By interconnecting, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available on the highest level, e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear-starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flying machine trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">Unlike most of the starters, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of stern starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn't matter in which position the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often face basic abstract questions that advance to the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moveable parts coming together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled aircraft that only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one thing works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monosphoist, the mechanically simplest remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a movable part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and cross-ruders, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, very much happens inside the inner life so that it can fly stably, and move everywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right is minimal, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the Moon is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">As a result, it receives the exceptional skill,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even as it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some are available in models, the rest is directly learned when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller turns out, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit limited.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration uses synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The extra safe press on the side of Broadway wants to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us, wages are in development and creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, intelligent creatures to shape them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other faster and faster in a very distant galaxy. they transformed the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they lightened brightly than all stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's rank the events at first in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell life on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands for us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most people considered it crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo increased significantly, which greatly improved the detection performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">In early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start of the detector, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes screwed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">That was basically the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">All that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT.</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When the wave is overhauled, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction, and the other is packed into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">In the course of the theory of relativity, lecturers often lead a real silver dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14th, for example, each of us was stretched and stretched when the waves were hit. the average man's stretch was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1. therefore, one declared the Ligo employees crazy.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be measured in less than one thousandth of a nucleus of a nuclear nucleus. this is grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will certainly be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this in 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, much smaller than things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create an image or a map of things by picking the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">It is different with sounds.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child for example.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now I'm talking about Alice." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"" "" "" "and Bob discovers them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by looking at changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So if we convert wave pattern into sound, we can hear the universe literally.</seg>
<seg id="522">The gravitation to listen, can reveal about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, circular: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Rotate the two bodies very quickly, you hear the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary that shapes the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's sound] No one who knows what to hear, recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-times solar mass, which turn around as fast as the bars of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 probes, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to explore the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can -- virtually or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super novas.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon, and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never look through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it, as the Big Bang is covered by its own tail light.</seg>
<seg id="541">With the help of gravitational waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And most importantly: I am optimistic that there are things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt which we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, as Ligo observes them, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are so to speak, the nodules for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo offers us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great metal detectors and listen to the noise and circus of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for one year I would say to all" "" "Yes!" "" "I feared." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">"" "whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "" "yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of holding speeches, my social anxiety - puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes" "" "has changed my life." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"" "" "" "yes" "" "changed me." ""</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected kind. it began with a question of my youngest.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kitten" "" "for unexplained reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"" "" "" "kittens, I need milk for my beak cup." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I was upset to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing or where I am going, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very tired.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I'm the author. I think things get out of mind, catch them to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting aside 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode, every nine days, four shows, every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows simultaneously in production: 24 episodes: grey's, 21 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series are running one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are programs I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who else does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, therefore I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think when the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard, whether you are going to run a company, a country or a class room, take a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so you understand that I'm not just hanging around on the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not about dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">So as if you wear a high note, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing about it is the totals.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy street, I could go on it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people stop when I explain the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the totals -- when I started to work and work and to make, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the totals!</seg>
<seg id="618">The sum is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz, then you can no different look for size.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to do differently than to strive for size, no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there are, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I must work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love the totals.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overloaded, overloaded, overstated, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mum is a single work title.</seg>
<seg id="644">"" "Harper tells people:" "" "my mom won't be there, but you can write my nanny." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titanic.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titers.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as usual: the same Titanic work, 15 hours-day, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with all the heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no money.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the totals I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some might think," "" "Hypocrisy, stupid Author Titan" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do what you do, you do what you are doing, being a teacher, a banker, a mom, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives one the buzz if you know the buzz, and knows how the buzz feels when you stop the buzz, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "south-state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I'm on the way out, late and she says:" "" "Mama, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I already want to say no, when two things are made aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she doesn't call anybody any more" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did it happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mom, do you like playing?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play with her sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding, because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the sum, I can do nothing but watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I create is the marathon which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl releases in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens, it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is coming back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it is there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the totals, but a buzz.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The sums, the sums of work, the titanium dioxide, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using broadcasts and TV and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totals are the electricity that comes from the zest of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be completed, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any debt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the hum again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't really like playing as they work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful because what a person prefers to be rather than home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I do.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">None of it is that I am too relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="731">We rage around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel overwhelmingly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take care of my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe meet me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you keep me naive for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or cookie replaced me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And speak my teenage daughter whole 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no more need.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to finish.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my delight, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the totals, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">To play in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you're doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and store it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I'll fail and I'll win. meeting friends, reading books, enjoying the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in education when I wanted to exceed myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece, why not take full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz then seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months, a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the sum, the humming is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">That's my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totals of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snappy that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem plays.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the clearer my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the totals. the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the screens, the sums, the sums, the other, the real buzz: the totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, lasting, bare and new feeling of being in me is wide. less titanium -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I am a writer. I think things happen, I stir you to life.</seg>
<seg id="789">That is part of the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to less work and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability for self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve nerve functions by different surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They certainly have one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." thereby, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">To save life you have to reduce the internal pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove some swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and the surroundings to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology instruction that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: regular stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">So we saw a new strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublemistin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our brain cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them near brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear, however -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then highlight color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we reimproved them from the point of view of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplant -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we reimplanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we reimplanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller's help, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we made an injury and reimplanted the same cells and now the cells remained. they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we were able to see under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplantable.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we color in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable level of skill, we hurt the motor-motor area in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralysed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were sure the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left, they see the monkey who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the stimulation of the rice.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time, we have figured out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">Bruno Luigi: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can do that."</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials at humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting with these great results, you have to fill about two kilograms of paper and forms to go through this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue looking into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients who perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy is the key to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it as unchanging gearing.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his big imitators in Beijing proved without doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy dwindles with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew, or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sober friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup, are mistaken, we could save democracy but that we need a truthful and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are bribed, our future gloomy and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the topic of waste I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "twin peaks paradox" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, who throws his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash, which is part of the wealthy savers and corporations, who are too anxious to invest in places where it would be productive and income, with which one could reduce the debt mountain and also produce all the things humanity needed, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past three months, 3,4 trillion dollars were invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">The $3,4 trillion US dollar sounds after a lot of money until you compare it with the $5.1 billion that at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate stock exchanges and sell real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low demand for macroeconomic demand, which, as in a final loop, promotes the pessimism of investors in which they do not invest.</seg>
<seg id="925">Unconsciously bring about the circumstances that lead to the killing of Oedipus.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hades with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its very wasteful art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian Democracy, of course, closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">However, it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it occupied the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, that they admitted to them the right to political co-determination with the same voice-weighting in questions of the state's belongings.</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "" "" "the Athenian democracy hasn't lasted too long --" ""</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle, which shines brightly, it is also quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our present liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy did not come until a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was narrowed to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our present-day democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, an implacable struggle between the two takes place, by gradually substituting politics and escaping them.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government and yet not in power because the power has migrated from politics to the economy and the divisions are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of carnivores that sustainably decimated the animals they nourish themselves, that they end up starving at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">The power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being exploited, the inequality increases, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managing directors of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" from democracy, the higher are the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour-power and the prosperity of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, like in ancient Athens, except for exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new ways of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers by automating and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is that as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts go deeper, as it -- very soon, as I believe -- will come in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to reunite the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics, and make sure that we democratise the reunited area, otherwise we end up in a pathological hyperautocracy, which makes the film "Matrix" appear like a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that in "matrix," in which machines serve people and people put their energy into research into the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athener "Agora," in long talks about the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of the company: please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all the incomes of capital and revenues come from and the concept of wage labour is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the companies, but who do not work therein, and employees working there, but the company does not belong there. no more pigeon more between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy: please introduce yourself briefly that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency backed by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging markets], in the interests of all of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency - we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country, into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">Imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare.</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a re-united politics and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which it prefers privileged people, and Marxist because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Luigi: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... What we do not do, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, meaning Larry Summers as a "long-term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will destabilise not only our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also perfect.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: actually, and now we are well.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the orator you said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it is played -- the area of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I may say this as provocative, China is now similar to England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is an error, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now to reproach China for doing what the West has done in the nineteenth century smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I thought that was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later in the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "that is to say good-bye to ourselves and the continual denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the eurozone, have still chosen denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable by political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when change happens it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: everyday.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone looking back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance, or any minister who is in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the creditors' side to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government to a halt, only because they did not want to deal with the distortions that passed through the euro zone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they had been going through a catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">"" "worse than during the" "" "Great Depression." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, confessed:" "" "that was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you still seem to be pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if it does not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not have catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire world economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to take the road of a post-modern 1930, according to which it seems to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of the Europeans as well as the non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you will be wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for having been with TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Of Roy Braun most of them have never heard before, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for so many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">He is 47 years old, slim, has an imperfectionist and describes himself on Twitter as "Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos."</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he's responsible for finding the shows and the content Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this bend.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows this review will get.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and above, it is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Braun is not about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to entertain "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He gets more thoughts about the mean bullying, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not excite.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something so Roy doesn't want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs a guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and votes through an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon gives things out for nothing, do you resort to, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who are recording everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you skipping or watching again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and get the answer, and it reads:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom above four republican US senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House landed at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show with data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it a bit differently.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of holding a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows their course, which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they took a risk and decided not to make a sitcom above four senators, but a drama series about a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">We have two very competitive, data-driven companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this about?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic says somehow that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you meet, then you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, it is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the multi-health system here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">Nobody. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in jail in the US and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google may make mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that data analysis can predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success was culminating in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the journal Nature.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data streams into decisions of life - at work, in legal enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we prefer to make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people are using unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, disassemble this problem into its components so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the items together again in order to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" is not in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, when they voted "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data starts to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and to not forget it, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there were data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball becomes wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks that you end up at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
