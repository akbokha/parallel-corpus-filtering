Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
a ren prison , where youngsters are supposed to meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel , where it is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers farm the former ground of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this , who had to get upset , because the car Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as of Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but therefore very informative .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how towns and villages have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one does not recognize as such .
in the big picture postcard , more detailed maps , so @-@ called original compositions , were incorporated into towns and villages .
according to the Bavarian Meas@@ u@@ rement Management , these were originated between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if French troops finally departed from Lun@@ é@@ ville &apos;s peace of 9 February 18@@ 01 , it was today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project further , founded the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus Bay@@ er@@ isches Ver@@ mess@@ aging Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the original composition for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is to be found on the website of the Bay@@ erische Landes@@ bibliothek .
the comparison in the morning / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
S@@ end@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , in Munich &apos;s district .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser only in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : in the zo@@ oming appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered flat@@ lands from the so @-@ called &quot; Ur@@ ption &quot; from which the basic tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land in sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the October festival in 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of the today &apos;s district , Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at the guest &apos;s dough &quot; or on the rise &quot; On the air &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße people were once locked up with del@@ u@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based district Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lu@@ ves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - a psychiat@@ rist in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended up buying the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he prohibited the personnel from using force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who worked for an exhibition with the prison .
for 280 patients there was first room , later it was expanded to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ asylum facility in Haar , 1905 .
the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now facing the site of the former Au@@ er Institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
West lies the football field of the TS@@ V Munich Ost , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural reference to the original structure of the asylum facility , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; main place &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
in December 1944 , the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the city centre .
a big remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Mari@@ enhof , where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn ( S @-@ Bahn ) track will take place .
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policies and racial ass@@ aults of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the State of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will come into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ ci@@ ally @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and will be noted here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , which are dispro@@ portion@@ ately aimed at minorities , led the group to issue the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ enses against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no gasoline during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report from the Mis@@ sour@@ i general prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are reported to be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to be ready to take deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 crimes of hate , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report programme which ranks the state in terms of the number of violations of the country &apos;s 16th rank .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to su@@ e a company because of housing and employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws encouraging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration detention , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing .
travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .
the electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ man Wei@@ de@@ vil@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties , representatives of the Fischer &apos;s CD@@ U trade association met at the square yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his operation , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplying 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s bach , he called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot make profitable on such steep surfaces .
the grass@@ land area provides a lot of work , much needed to be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zer , even if he does not conduct bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the re@@ for@@ estation of the areas could be dra@@ gged out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; farmers are often critic@@ ised for funding &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants .
the area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of them were promoted by leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fischer@@ bach .
thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of pasture fence .
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; says Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job without farmers and country@@ men . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Peter Weiss also noted : &quot; here , best food is produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Association Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg permits the state funding of wil@@ low f@@ ences .
the objective is the disclosure of the Black Forest .
pre@@ condition is the presence of a sponsor@@ ship recorded by the L@@ PR .
furthermore , the enclosed area must not be tow@@ ed ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation .
for the Fis@@ her@@ man &apos;s Wei@@ de@@ aun@@ ching Project in 2018 , there is currently the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els , who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .
the estimated cost of disclosure is 35 hectares , calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .
is nothing sacred any more ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the president &apos;s suggestions for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to be fair , Miller didn &apos;t grasp the statue itself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have liked him if he had done it .
but he took on their importance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Laz@@ arus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .
when Miller A@@ co@@ sta wrote : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that ligh@@ tens the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is really right , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to Laz@@ arus words , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , or your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , and the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; miserable waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was better seen on our screens . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump USA are not welcome .
this conflict , because of the significance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Laz@@ arus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she took a high political plot .
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Republi@@ can by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic depic@@ tion .
Laz@@ arus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American n@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Laz@@ arus changed the significance of the statue , people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty brought no one , but rather an early Neo@@ conserv@@ atism , which brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty progres@@ ses .
it is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh was quite unusual here .
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
Laz@@ arus &apos;s great imagin@@ ative deed was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible travel on the decks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to acknowledge .
their torch is not to enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black praise Scottish members of the UK Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the power director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK must learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner of the road .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it &apos;s absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m course , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; said Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in was great . &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that you should watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
the team captain says that she is &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; to the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved in med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
what concerns my speech as captain ?
yes , I think it went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and to profit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heating up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to its political principles .
he sm@@ iled at the criticism , certainly .
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led as sheep for slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work to be more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .
and that &apos;s why the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union lam@@ ented him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is aston@@ ish@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has demonstrated a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ press his ha@@ iry head to chemotherapy on his side .
therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum , which is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or h@@ ook@@ y people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , not troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and non @-@ professional .
the pastor rec@@ ited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also don &apos;t appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , and they are dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so @-@ called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the govern@@ ors described as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam @-@ attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical bodies , or to arrest and silence prot@@ esters .
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue was last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County changed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for its use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of papers multip@@ lied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter writers hit his head .
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with the UK , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he has not sil@@ enced her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
the former European No@@ .1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for local comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year next year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links to the final round , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new location and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the association founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how it achieves its fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid down this place .
he is a ze@@ al@@ ous advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels really special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the past year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to his home ground for action .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad about the way it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists from the Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf University Hospital ( U@@ KE ) are involved in a study to achieve this result .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are due to passive smoking in 16@@ 7 , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher .
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new study is published in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; International Journal of Public Health &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
house closures prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are reasonably in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says the head of the Bau@@ hof Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is much se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not indicated in the plans .
traffic , which is always ham@@ pered by the construction work , is a big problem for the Bau@@ tru@@ pp company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists from red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai family in the ind@@ ones@@ ian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually puts a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace .
after half an hour the sal@@ ted tu@@ ber is taken out with eager , un@@ washed hands and swal@@ lowed .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with dirty water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a dach@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into daily life in the High@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote for a public raising in front of the occupying troops .
an existing movement , which was stir@@ red up for independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers .
in 2003 , the province was officially divided into the province of Papua and West Papua with an independent part of Papua New Guinea that encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island .
the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 hour drive with the rented car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and from corrugated iron roofs , which were converted by rust into various yel@@ low@@ ish brown tones .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the poor@@ est province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also the Indones@@ ian gold@@ land .
the world &apos;s largest and most profitable gold mine , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars .
in addition , Papua related wood resources have an estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these riches are , however , a source of misery for the Papua people ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military has a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 U.S. dollars to one single officer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pap@@ u@@ ian demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as tribe high@@ land in the 1970 &quot; s became genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is said in a report by the arch @-@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since incidents happen every week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .
the bolts have reinforced , as Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic developments are changing , as Muslim migrant workers come from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra , and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ners cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people are struggling to keep up with this .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell h@@ ens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local parts of Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai local native to the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the indigenous people of Papua ( the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indones@@ ian President , Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua related to the 2014 election campaign .
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua ( including Pan@@ i@@ ai ) on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ i &apos;s inaugur@@ ation , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali when two Indones@@ ian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers offen@@ ded their tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ ts , said victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the children &apos;s group .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard hit that he fell into coma .
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Syri@@ ans , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bows and led the Wa@@ ita dance - continuously in the circle and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldier was sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses do more than three times resist , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called on the crowd to return home .
nobody was in the mood to listen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ m was hit three times , his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and tried his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who just bears a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Papua New Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ port@@ edly said that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because it was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people are threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings only arrived on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
three weeks later , in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical mis@@ eries in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the establishment of historical violations of human rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses almost immediately began .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said that he had no plans to set up in Papua related gri@@ ev@@ ance mechanism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , who accused the UN for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calling for more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been settled in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with a gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military looked for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings did not cease .
on Tuesday , the Indones@@ ian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a contractor who refused to bring a unconscious man to hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited members of the village prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing up warning signals .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , such as the TI@@ ME .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers involved to account and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indones@@ ian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free State of Papua ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the State of Papua by inf@@ ecting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indones@@ ian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM guides come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty increases dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is out of reach as well .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the indigenous communities of Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nab@@ ire Airport .
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Board of Directors .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
moreover , restrictions of reporting on international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua related institutions because of lack of coordination with related institutions .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jok@@ ov &apos;s campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists attempting to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest eastern provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ using and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government is largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called for the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua ( including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting ) .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man for the Indones@@ ian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; there is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that participated in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Syri@@ ans say they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a rob@@ ber military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ shot families had a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried in an area just opposite the police and the military station .
they know that perhaps they will never give them justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what else can we do ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest living towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that , in just two years , swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident , who called his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units broke out fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and cooled the building .
the government said it was working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers around the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , outer fair@@ ing to decoration or insulation , came .
in the UK , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup single only on two wins , thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classics are thus preserved to the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the applications .
it was not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , that the proposal had already come to complete the final at a neutral place .
new starting in 2018 is only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host &apos;s right in the next round in the next round .
in order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements in training stations etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to do less official media events before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers take forbidden objects to the aircraft , find a survey
a survey among airline passengers found that more than 20 percent know@@ ingly or un@@ consciously banned items past the control points of U.S. Transportation Security Administration were smu@@ g@@ gled , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while inad@@ vert@@ ently carrying banned knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 per cent said they had been bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had mistakenly had fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ tered Service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also stated that younger travellers would rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of those surv@@ eyed admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something prohibited by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of mill@@ enni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , members of Generation X were .
the most common items which were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 percent said to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ e also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the plane .
the company said it asked travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally killed smu@@ g@@ gling goods by airport security and how many intentionally had done it .
it is no surprise that people who are most likely to wear smu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - by security , those were the most frequently flying .
the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are prohibited liquids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
&quot; &quot; &quot; electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to deal with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ scored that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever tri@@ ump@@ y figures on sales increases and even more col@@ os@@ sal sales targets , Tes@@ la chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed another , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure when announ@@ cing the latest quarterly record : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k had often adverti@@ sed over 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car whose extra@@ dition is currently starting .
Mus@@ k now dre@@ amt : of the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations evapor@@ ate in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side .
Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles last year .
by 2018 - all models will be combined - 500@@ ,000 will be , one million in 2020 .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day .
if you order a Model 3 today , expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ in @-@ practice production lines with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
however , if there are too much delays , the non @-@ binding of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running in dro@@ ves .
EPA leader P@@ ru@@ sting withdraw@@ s due to dela@@ ying the rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 countries , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about a period that went off on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for floor @-@ related o@@ zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or obstruc@@ t economic growth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump , was At@@ tor@@ ney General of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , has long been a reliable opponent of stringent environmental regulations .
since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels resist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ten regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has over@@ stepped its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its turn@@ around in o@@ zone standards simply emphas@@ ised the willingness of EPA to co @-@ operate with states by the complex process of timely fulfilling of the new standards .
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EP@@ O has often failed to comply with the deadlines for execution and then been waiting to be tried by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the EP@@ O &apos;s statement said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the rules are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bill approved last month shall delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states that had su@@ ed EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s conversion - after our complaints - is an important asset to the health and safety of these 6,@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York included in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ies , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources respond to sunlight .
the resulting smo@@ g may cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contributes to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ it &apos;s surprising course of exchange .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d of Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological cr@@ us@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to tackle environmental pollution and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates its 7@@ 50@@ th anniversary of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth ben@@ e@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ bl@@ gen their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it &apos;s a unique village jewel . &quot;
in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Landes@@ bank . count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the Berg with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei in Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
according to the wor@@ ding of the document , on the Tum@@ linger Berg , in addition to the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged , and not vice versa .
so there were also people there .
as from the description of the Ober@@ amt Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Berg &quot; of the third , the domin@@ ating village centre of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 are under@@ lining these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest continued to remain owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath the church .
associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the elder of the two collap@@ sed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell rang for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed out later during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , window pan@@ es were inserted and the bells were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half collap@@ sed .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished .
only the present tower of Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g remained a witness of the 750 year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius system from the &quot; creative reti@@ re@@ es &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn .
as organisers , the friends and promot@@ ers Tum@@ lin@@ gens invite you to the 6th seren@@ ade to St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle on Sunday , July 16th .
it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann &apos;s position speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3 : 30 p.m .
at the end of the ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organizers exhibit the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tumours and hear@@ tw@@ ood .
the friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to homeland care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini affir@@ ms .
association wants to check the permit of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirements for the construction and has therefore turned to the Council of Agriculture . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called on Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to accept its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , because at the time in Vier@@ sen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal .
in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones are meant to prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spar@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but that did not appro@@ ve the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to be taken back , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again decided to re@@ affir@@ m the zone of wind in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this makes it impossible to obtain permission for the establishment of wind turbines according to plan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding writings have been in the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle makes it the occasion to re@@ consider the matter again .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
last year , the company , where the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are site .
with the construction of the four wind turbines , electricity needs to be covered by around 11,@@ 400 households - roughly one @-@ fifth of the power demand of all four @-@ se@@ ater households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor craw@@ l together : a woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10@@ am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ ab@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was killed in a fatal accident .
two more people were hurt .
the state road remained closed for hours .
after police instructions a 17 @-@ year @-@ old woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her passenger car took the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion .
city and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre .
the commercial club and the city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 in order to enti@@ ce residents to shopping in the city centre .
as the chairman of the trade association , Christian König , announced the &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend to sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the city holds apart from the usual supermarket goods .
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; midnight @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the campaign is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bag pointing to the festival weekend , says Christian König .
the municipal administration and the commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the commercial club and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive City &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers , such as the first &quot; active day &quot; to the well @-@ held Sunday , talks with all business owners and hosts in order to make them active participation .
attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ving of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potential should be re@@ opened or re @-@ opened .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many natives would have lost the city center while shopping out of sight .
in the end everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which was partly broad@@ ened , had said king in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that five Thür@@ inger cities will take part in the nation &apos;s third &quot; home shopping &quot; day .
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the I@@ HK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with its buying behaviour can influence its direct environment .

Tr@@ ump set up after si@@ fted tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on January 27th , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
the US president compla@@ ined because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; you can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and to let Mexico pay for the project .
the tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would look like a &quot; dump &quot; after having proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States .
Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after calling Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ akt as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ based Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ roe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stood out with guns to block his way .
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ hop @-@ suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors , the occup@@ ants ho@@ ver@@ ed in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is only a hind@@ ran@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of them met very real si@@ ghs in the audience . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have been coming back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were retri@@ eved by K@@ u K@@ lux Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever accused of murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really incredible that no single person was arrested in all these years - although we see them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps the organization of rep@@ lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
bro@@ o@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old member of the Georgia State con@@ gres@@ s@@ men and a citizen of civil rights .
for him , the position serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we get justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a for@@ en@@ sic physician puts a blanket on the cor@@ pse of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FBI agents received from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 Mon@@ roe and the surrounding county were suspected of being suspected of being kidn@@ apped by the N@@ BC News .
but no one has ever been charged .
although the susp@@ ects have been on a free footh@@ old for decades , citizens &apos; rights advocate that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for their vote for the first time in the summer .
approximately at the same time as the choice st@@ ah according to the FBI the black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com had a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Dor@@ othy &apos;s wife Dor@@ othy , and that the baby she bore was not of her husband .
on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
but when they went away from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b cir@@ cl@@ ed the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between national and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , eliminating the evidence and conce@@ aling the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a right to vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register and if you vote , then this will happen to you . &quot;
for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual retro@@ spec@@ ting of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , po@@ ign@@ ant and is founded in a kind of deep racism which many want to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch , and more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that &apos;s the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve gone through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pressed into a room and listened when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene Co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ cer for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
on the other side of the room the actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and push@@ es him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a sof@@ tens the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out laughing .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what ? ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; asked Ras@@ con@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people then --- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black performers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s exactly where the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene once again begins .
this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is violent and fast .
there are cries , shots , and then silence .
a woman clothed with grief stands above the bodies of the actors and seduc@@ es Bil@@ lie Holidays in mour@@ ning &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many just come down the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as impressive moisture every eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sti@@ pen@@ dium .
if the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the body name .
children ho@@ e at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they &apos;re not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw the rope away and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ con@@ a embra@@ ces two of his te@@ amm@@ ers and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that it is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done that for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience sat together with the actors for dinner .
at one table a white pair from Atlanta tells us about the position with a black couple that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words that left the performance behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ ching still continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today only police shooting is called . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding court at his table , eating and remember@@ ing civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the position is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like learning nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; reconc@@ iled Wagner to Bay@@ reuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf focuses on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) optionally shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
in front of it is an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ ishly posed as a rock @-@ ergi@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels are reminiscent of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that goes through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ gold daughters - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as well as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ESS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seduc@@ es them to Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier a cor@@ pse broke into the trunk and put the Kra@@ h@@ wall@@ o cli@@ que . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing is singing the wonderfully nasty Hagen , which envel@@ ops the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight boxing .
brutal the scene when he was struck by Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) must believe it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are enthusias@@ tically celebrated , who hum@@ bly bow down and blow their hands on Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awaited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to leave a bell of the pipe concert about himself , five years later there was a big jubil@@ ation in which the isolated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls were going down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed this event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has grown to be an understanding of its point of view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
max amount works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture fair , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I have already worked at school in the open all @-@ day .
what are your experiences ?
quantity : it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to deal with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ professional volunteer .
how does that happen ?
amount : I have passed S@@ LC .
and then a civil engineering study , we say , successfully abor@@ ted .
I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe , really .
and was it like that ?
quantity : I have collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker education and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends where you make your FS@@ J .
it can be done from anti@@ quity to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was exactly the right thing that mat@@ ured .
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different from the course of civil engineering ?
of course , here it is not about to calculate st@@ atics .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind each other .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been brought out of the family , must always go into it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : for that I am not the type .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is just like that .
Pear@@ son cuts a further 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revi@@ ve business
the British training group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will disman@@ tle more 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces .
the job cuts announced by the general director John Fall@@ on for the end of 2018 and early 2019 are in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 jobs .
Pear@@ son announced a third cost @-@ cutting program to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( USD 3@@ 94 million ) in May to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning .
the company , which sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged , having achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy &apos;s con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed by suicide bomb
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and wounded several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , issued an explanation by NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ Arab district .
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in a NATO statement , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m airport .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ian is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a mostly Shi@@ ite District of Kab@@ ul .
the Taliban claimed they had executed this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ b@@ ings in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest military attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban away from power in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in recent weeks the suicide bom@@ bers in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and in particular the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay Smo@@ g Ru@@ le To K@@ ills
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , under which states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions , a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O announced late on Wednesday that the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; o@@ zone provisions 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said it showed the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA leader Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .
a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tr@@ ump , wants to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the democr@@ ats and conserv@@ atives who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that breathing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants community space
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decided to establish a communal space in the future sen@@ iors residence .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing piece of land was signed , says mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
it will still take a while until the area belonging to the church community has been in municipal ownership , but there is now no planning obstacle to the project stem@@ ming from a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room .
one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - approximately 55 square metres - and an adjacent terrace with a total surface of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are ho@@ vering , such a common space , not just as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the community of sen@@ i@@ ority , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the lap . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn by funding opportunities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
the establishment of a community room would be , as reported T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 per cent eligible .
the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to throw a stick between the legs , the conclusion that saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the lift height and makes the construction more economical - is possible .
need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer does not think so .
if it helps : it will happen unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not that easy in the community room .
Daniela recall refers to the many own buildings , with which one does not get ahead so well , but now they lean into the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m very gri@@ eving with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is necessarily speaking for the community room - but absolutely against community participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to non @-@ resident or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , because with the purchase of the area there is no subsi@@ dy , but instead of a real counterpart , which is market@@ able in doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sta@@ ig@@ s &apos;s proposal to split the resolution according to the decision will find three advoc@@ ates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there are two counter@@ parts in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller sum@@ mar@@ ises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we take the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with car : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist died on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath by a car and seriously injured .
as the police announced , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder had been on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg in the direction of Hil@@ den on the road .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the bush Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car leader in the same direction gave priority to him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder went on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the on@@ coming traffic .
he met with a car driving a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ting car .
FC Bayern Munich must for@@ ego David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago at the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to sau@@ lt the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first time in the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 hrs / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the staff of the German football World Cup Champion Munich will be getting bigger and bigger .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the B@@ V@@ B .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
the mou@@ ch@@ ets Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six trials An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , adding : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season .
&quot; soccer is also a tac@@ tic , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
walking in the resin of star to star
&quot; &quot; &quot; the nationwide first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be created in the resin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andreas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meets the need for information of many resin visitors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he unites nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the scheduled route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the tables should be added via the internet .
for this reason , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of the site .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star Path will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared .
they also learned why stars have different colors or why a star is more lumin@@ aire than another , although he lies much further away .
also , in which con@@ stellation you find a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , which is the highest atory observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
in the Uni @-@ City , since 2003 , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen .
starting in front of Geb@@ hard &apos;s hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet path leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; off @-@ ground &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to @-@ degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a diameter of 6.5 milli@@ meters , while the exact 75 @-@ metre @-@ distant sun measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
while the light from sun to Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fix would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 l@@ bs , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the failed World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ fe@@ ather champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ slide world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down to light weight .
and he must move on weight @-@ weights &#91; 135 &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand this .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this struggle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound ster@@ ling this year to arrange a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) , who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia , and later expressed himself openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he would appreciate Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he might be participating in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thought of the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the three @-@ battle champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ finish . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show stroke strength , then boxing .
both said they could sense the momentum that developed for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that needs to be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great fight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four injured after pun@@ cture
in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday after@@ no@@ ons .
after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost its control over his vehicle at 16.@@ 30 , shortly before the connection point of the market .
the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment where he over@@ came and then stuck on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first provision of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be passed by the left @-@ hand drive at the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; triple chain works better &quot;
after 2 : 2 , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes for the opening of the season against Braunschweig , that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points points .
with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was pleased with the result , not the two opponents were at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to pay better in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the supply chain is to be further optimised .
and a gate after a free@@ wheel doesn &apos;t want to capture the For@@ tun@@ en any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , it will be that no one stands alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better even after the experience in the preparation of the three @-@ chain , than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t even know how to act in au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we are in the middle position at the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we do not have so many mistakes in building up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can take four points on Sunday and focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a good season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about this .
&quot; I only judge the start into the season after six to eight play days , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can almost start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , as they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against an ascen@@ sion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know exactly where they &apos;re standing at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Interior Defender of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland are a light favourite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we sweep them away just because we have the right to reach under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive with only one defeat against au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the second Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat in advance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Chief Executive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ old application tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Society of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ inal@@ verk@@ et ) has begun the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should make the assessment of the age more precise after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
up to now , migration shor@@ tages have sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; possibly is under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied about their age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the examined person is 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that she will be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , when x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they were earlier or later than usually passed through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we shouldn &apos;t do that as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of developing a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest risk is when the person is less than 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full on the Plan
the work on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg proceeds well .
on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road and Transport at the Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule will be met .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red coloured sand@@ stone and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
as the two other bridges also , it has meanwhile arrived in the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red coloured sand@@ stone .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively , 10,@@ 60 meters long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons wei@@ ghted so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side .
this is a peripheral attachment that is also used as an operating mode .
on the southern part of the bridge , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge deck is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way should be gone .
the special thing about this is that it concerns finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger Company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented brid@@ ge@@ caps .
the laying of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach requires a special sense of intuition .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
prior to the work , the residents were informed of the project by hand@@ outs .
in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting house in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg the traffic is controlled by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the entrance of the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed .
the cost of the three bridge renov@@ ations amounts to 700@@ ,000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to an alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties representing the volcanic Ei@@ fel region ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day , because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell , according to the poster , &quot; a great campaign environment . &quot;
and familiar names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ l makes the winning combination for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ developers , but to demonstrate .
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel is colorful . &quot;
originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at one table &quot; was planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place on the parking underneath the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D @-@ event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colorful picture that is there .
and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , Chair@@ woman of the Forum One World and one of the author@@ itative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great , how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and lots of food , among them a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D volcanic Ei@@ fel reported that he tried such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 year old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was in demand first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces available because of the already built @-@ in lau@@ r@@ enti@@ ary church .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at around 20 o &apos;clock a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle , provides various speakers , including the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
there are about 200 listeners in the hall , waiting to hear that the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch hold their speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move away - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ gang@@ ster Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli will be held in the Has@@ lach Kloster@@ konz@@ erte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is solo@@ ist of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli .
both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach will sound like a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; World Music &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the play &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz club N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games blend into a fascinating Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk .
this core piece of the program was premi@@ ered this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ lach monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparently most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; twi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who ultimately broke out bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in spite of all this , the brun@@ ette act@@ ress ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with each one I &apos;ve taken . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I had played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and seriously believed the du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it never bo@@ thered me or ham@@ pered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I just never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , she suffered from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt offen@@ ded , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to react in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some people call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from all the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a rally with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much thought ... today I will tell you as residents of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice .
&quot; as a trainer , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia Rallye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the Democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; the regime change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would hin@@ der us from working to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , Gover@@ nor Justice &apos;s announcement is just the last refusal of a party that is from top to bottom and unable to find a positive message , &quot; said R@@ NC @-@ chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ologies for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics leader D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight against dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who have been cut off gold and silver med@@ als in competitions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to re@@ porters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said he was also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ introduction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world championships , which begin on Friday in London according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told re@@ porters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
funeral ceremony for soldiers cut down in Mali
during a funeral service at the North Hes@@ sian Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two soldiers surrounded by helicop@@ ters in Mali have thought .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ explained crash of the crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they described the two opposite drivers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don@@ ors of their profession . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have achieved in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali in West Africa .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
at noon , only the members of the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and politics began .
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens premi@@ er Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Army Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
rose branches lay down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
Minister of Defence of Le@@ yen called the in@@ comm@@ enting soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and tram@@ pled in .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann set up the flight operations of the combat helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt about the UN mission in Mali did not show the Minister of Le@@ yen : the use was dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .
this is what the Royal House shared on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen had agreed with her husband &apos;s decision and continued in the communication .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , remains unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and also covers the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ inc@@ ely Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted , he did not consider himself equal to his wife - neither after the death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the final resting @-@ place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ ble@@ man , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy .
while his later wife had kept the people &apos;s sympathy , Prince Hen@@ rik had a hard time with the Dan@@ es in his nearly 50 @-@ year reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises that I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who in this country had the reputation to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellectu@@ als , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is reluct@@ ant to res@@ ign for a quick re @-@ election of the parliament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday , the Parliament spoke out for the dissolution of the Parliament . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green MP from the State Parliament faction in Lower Saxony has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the state election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green party El@@ ke T@@ westen combined their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election in their constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) in 2018 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to take it up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats .
so far , the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag will be elected on January 14th next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether it could continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
however , Stephan Wei@@ l is indispensable for the fact that the parliament decides to take his self @-@ dissolution as soon as possible .
the CD@@ U will likely opt for further action on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the parliament &apos;s parliament chooses to trust and elect a successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these possibilities must be properly insp@@ ected legally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will calm@@ ly discuss all questions if they are legally audi@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ alen &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not a tra@@ itor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens demanded the ab@@ u@@ sive parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their land daily . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we , of course , assume that they return their land daily , which she has received from the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jans@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I deliberately decided not to speak out any language in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal to the voters but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal President of the Socialists and Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the Australian T@@ v@@ est costs the majority of Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her past vanity and fru@@ stration brings her personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony carries on this dirty intri@@ gue game and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect us from pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs , Herr Schmidt ?
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
the Agriculture minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech and Ans@@ wer .
Mr Schmidt , How can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check stamp pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de the federal states provide the latest information on the affected lay @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , health haz@@ ards are practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been abandoned immediately and since the announcement of the sad@@ ness of Germany in close contact with the authorities of the countries .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has as much concern as producers to ensure that the products sold are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual sugar content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able .
un@@ polluted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time , not the factories are to blame .
are production plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants do not have any immediate fault .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rather , they must expect economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as always , there is too little control in the event of serious seri@@ ousness .
is it missing only on the personnel or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 percent .
this is precisely why a consistent explanation of such events and hand@@ ing over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where off@@ ences can be present is of crucial importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment of the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and transpor@@ table foods .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
through the pan@@ eled means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers have come into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear that the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food supply animals is not acceptable and must be stopped immediately .
this must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and seamlessly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the financial rules of Football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not dis@@ rupt N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the manag@@ erial organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G will eventually have to prove that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar was financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can safely make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruling family of Qatar .
clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ ated and ris@@ ked themselves to ruin when banks or owners reloc@@ ated their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and although Plat@@ ini has been dis@@ gra@@ ced by the Pres@@ i@@ dency of 2015 , his successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ aller will continue to frigh@@ ten himself from excessive expendi@@ tures .
&quot; surely , FF@@ P is not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , over The Associ@@ ated Press last week .
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package deal , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be accounted for at 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the har@@ dest sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the League members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
the UEF@@ A is looking for clu@@ bs that could try to over@@ estimate their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club .
while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor was to exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate in@@ comes .
this is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided to sponsor the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship from the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments made by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambass@@ adors will be sent and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the UEF@@ A had no preliminary talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke of the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , as they were not allowed to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales .
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s departure by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of La Liga , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS referring to the last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because there are different ways or different interests , if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new shock supplier
in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at has produced Fre@@ y board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is at a possible end : the airline circul@@ ates the order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Swiss spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott also confirmed a report from the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed flash boards of 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ dant in front of landing to the passengers .
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of about 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ emaker manufacturer .
the Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new tender .
but only Swiss producers come into question .
according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will endeav@@ our to renew the contract beyond the spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for a statement .
since 2006 , the Swiss chocolate panels have been distributed on board their flights .
before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut has supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss had the opportunity to put the logo in place two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are indul@@ ged with goo@@ dies from the confection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in the Business Class nas@@ ches passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i by Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i from Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and Economy Class , is also spread out on the short circuit .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is also a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ enabled era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels as if time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a talking tin of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - actors of middle ages play hor@@ ny children who are grown up - they nevertheless managed to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with adults playing adults now , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more to watering can , among them a reef on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 &apos;s years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lov@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot , included in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well done impression by Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons side@@ burns of &apos; Sing@@ les &apos; , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy now feels like an old boy .
it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he achieves what I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; the last scene that will show the band how to visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Amazon meanwhile reminds of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its East @-@ West Ring@@ combat icon@@ ography . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is a documentary film : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard car@@ rot Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an extensive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - among them J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ af Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much engaged in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - it often plays like a single .
in six long episodes , it pul@@ ls away , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was edited on a smaller length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continually visit the American embassy whose Lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything to feed for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious roman@@ ian cre@@ ators are not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
impact on Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in beating the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar district , Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart .
fifteen accused were arrested between the age of 25 and 77 years , and arrest warran@@ ts were issued against them .
in addition , the officials ensured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
during the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
German arrest warran@@ ts were issued against the two susp@@ ects .
the two are therefore probably extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators participated in the campaign .
a total of over 300 polic@@ emen were deployed .
the Ma@@ fia &apos;s members are accused of drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz has been investigating the organised drug trade in southern Germany since summer 2016 .
there was a lively exchange between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo and investig@@ ators of the Cri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale deployment was also accompanied by four Palermo officials .
the focus of the study was on Italian nationals with close ties to the Italian Ma@@ fia .
also an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the gang &apos;s account .
wise lam@@ ents large lo@@ op@@ holes in the alien @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm in case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the representative for the German Federal Government &apos;s refugee management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; serious ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he warned in an analysis of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the data , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including around 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data were not sufficiently maintained , data quality in parts has not been good until now .
in isolated cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; by people who are no longer alive or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the Register . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; faulty data inputs can significantly slow return processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on sufficient people , moreover , EU citizens are gathered , which would not have to leave at all . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such false orders lead to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it means in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they have arrived from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the paper , it is said that BA@@ MF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conduct such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 it was virtually no longer possible , according to the newspaper , pointing to the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Dublin Agreement is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can return it to the country of immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also return refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
the domestic spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatening due to the lack of an Italian asylum system with un@@ lawful reception conditions and a risk of child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach provided the blood donation service for other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
Jürgen Gre@@ ul , who in the meantime has now donated 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .
traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s amazing how our body is designed to do so and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , yet un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher because the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their components . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , corn makers reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 spin @-@ backs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ Kreis@@ readiness Officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apparently switching to the theatre was led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Re@@ beer were among the multiple don@@ ors and received awards for 50 donated blood donations .
half so many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ an@@ ie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter gave each 500 milli@@ litres of their life @-@ juice ten times each .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation on an increase .
the Bank of England has warned that economic growth is &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it maintained the interest rates on family income in the midst of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to maintain interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , while less members stro@@ ve in this month as the weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and rose to 1.6 % in 2017 and warned that the pressure on domestic income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .
but it sign@@ aled that interest increases would be necessary in the next few years to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and said that the bor@@ rowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth stimulus package issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is said that now it is expected that it will provide 15 billion pounds in the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the rate of interest , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; somewhat greater &quot; extent than the markets await .
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the bank stressed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incre@@ ments &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts below for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % higher than in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rates and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly at the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households who are affected by rising inflation and marginal cost increases , as the tigh@@ tening is even worse before it becomes better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that in the next few years , monetary policy cannot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that the wages to the end of her three @-@ year forecast will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to weak pounds , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes a year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU referendum causing the sin@@ king of the sound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased because inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .
inflation dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and it will again attract it in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bank said that the exceeding in proportion to its goal of 2 % was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quite &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak pound . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew Mont@@ br@@ ink , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent reg@@ ression of swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are looking for businesses looking to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals go out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages lock out , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should prescri@@ be 10,000 people with controversial HIV drug
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against the funding of the drug in the N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic ( pre@@ p ) , which may reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decisive moment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infectious diseases .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means taking that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come into question for the treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people living in England and registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in to participate in their local participating sex clinic .
the program is signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting and implementing clinical evidence on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive Officer at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when targeted towards vulnerable and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded experiment in England in order to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and is not subject to a negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now that the pre@@ p test medicine was procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect individuals who are HIV @-@ infected and that it will help us to step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living a big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , turned into Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack her bags and sold .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I looked for something comparable to my price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with an ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed from Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the task .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to make it look longer .
in the kitchen the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went into it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is counter@@ weight , so when you push the door , it gli@@ des very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
here they have succeeded in enlar@@ ging the floor area and at the same time using high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit .
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are important , but they don &apos;t play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of some standard in something amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an analysis of one of the largest real estate imperial Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De LU@@ TI@@ S lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De LU@@ TI@@ S portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; - describes in the De LU@@ TI@@ S family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that col@@ in property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the breakdown of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the spl@@ its proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , following several failed negotiations , the first hear@@ ings of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , has excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul of in@@ competent management of some possessions .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it filed by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and law firms held by both parties .
MS De LU@@ TI@@ S and her dec@@ eased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and del@@ i shops from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans of the family .
Col@@ in says that he began West@@ co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De LU@@ TI@@ S says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share her property with her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De LU@@ TI@@ S group of companies , but Col@@ in claims that Mark had been paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in was very reluct@@ ant , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the AF@@ L and after a biography from the year 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De LU@@ TI@@ S and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very sad that my brother Paul has decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the courts &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to cur@@ tail the president &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course .
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information that comes into the hands of the president .
Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
Kell@@ ys &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame dro@@ pl@@ ets by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ ump &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit , according to six former election campaign officers , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . thank you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps these campaign officials know something that we others do not know - that tr@@ umps would contain even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never find out about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him several times , then their efforts paid off .
but no one has been able to consistently prevent tr@@ ump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting the tr@@ ump material that may promote their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers to provide du@@ bi@@ ous information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example written by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that dr@@ unk@@ ers can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with cor@@ rupted ch@@ equ@@ es , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exactly this happened at the end of February when someone announced a printed copy of an article from Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking questions about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ers are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys &apos;s mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals receive mail from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the aid of the population will be asked and hoped for .
the police across Europe send postcards of dangerous criminals to escape this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
as the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known by nature , information from the population is hoped and requested .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many fu@@ gi@@ tives were hiding on holiday destinations , called it by Euro@@ pol .
I put together 21 postcards for lu@@ cr@@ ative criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ i@@ wanted , more than 2.5 million times has been viewed .
36 of the online spec@@ ulations could have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them due to indications after the publication on the website .
travelers will negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners in the West Mid@@ lands stand again with some determined travellers on the foot of war , who have tra@@ ded a dit@@ ch drawn by the congregation to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of v@@ ans after they were ki@@ cked out in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry citizens have urged the Council of Soli@@ hull to say that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw rocks on the pass@@ ers @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced through shame to implement , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , moved forward and are back now .
more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my com@@ mon@@ place if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a local , who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we &apos;ve just seen the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the other side of Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to proceed as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling for 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise will be from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to open again on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then ambient company company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the local tax .
in the fall of 2014 , in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but most of all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time .
he was to be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you will be named Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof located in front of the entrance for a longer period of time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are to be done .
the floors were pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to be done by March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later on how Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale city center level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set itself wide , explains Sch@@ erer further .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer .
the city &apos;s ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the level of investment , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly .
just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outside systems are also placed on the front man , which is already clearly visible .
a large terrace is created in a courtyard , which is open to the public by the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Agent Sets the Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the panel has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper showed the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had wi@@ dened and intensified its investigations .
the station CN@@ N reported that there are already initial invitations from the body in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ ump &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have pur@@ pos@@ efully interven@@ ed in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ ump campaign team and Moscow .
the focus of the investigation is to face several men who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans during the election campaign .
according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more tr@@ umps of private and business environment .
a few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that the Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator Tr@@ ump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accus@@ ation whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair .
the main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be charged .
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also known as indic@@ t@@ ments .
mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite people to take part in E@@ id .
according to the radio station CN@@ N , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. also Tr@@ ump Ad@@ visor and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his dam leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort also attended the meeting .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the exposure showed that Mu@@ eller did not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
nevertheless , the implementation of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for President Tr@@ ump &apos;s concern .
in the midst of the new revelations , the President , on Thursday evening , used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y Russia &apos;s affair as a campaign for its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a complete invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , stated in a statement that he didn &apos;t know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
but I usually work in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House appro@@ ves all measures that ha@@ sten@@ ed the work of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special agent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FBI chief James Com@@ ey said three times that not against the president .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed on that , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this disc@@ ard , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump had become lou@@ der , he wanted to h@@ amp@@ er the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee in June , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees .
that spark@@ ed speculation as to whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss .
unlike an independent investig@@ ator of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later retired president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on to the president of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a move .
two groups of repub@@ li@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented the draft laws on Thursday , after which the special promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : huge ic@@ e@@ berg driving Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the West@@ ant@@ ark@@ tis a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this was communicated by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that have registered researchers over the past three decades .
there is no danger for human beings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the ic@@ e@@ berg , is unclear after research data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fac@@ tual background .
according to many researchers , it can be related to global warming .
so far the collap@@ sed col@@ os@@ sus has been part of the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
as a result , it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
to the north of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed several years ago .
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete file of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
there are some indications that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , as the front edge has never moved as far as it is currently .
in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point .
melting of ice shelf and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after the melting itself .
however , the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antar@@ c@@ tica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the recording , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will resume or fall back in the long run and possibly come together , his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man added : &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even if these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , many ic@@ el@@ ves of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long skirt of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature was attributable to the drop in temperature .
over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees , making it one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants the ho@@ ur@@ ly rate at the staff
because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to come out of the employers association to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the county day announced 41 new jobs in the administration .
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces now have their first working day behind them .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously very sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications had to be reported for the seats in this year .
nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ant positions in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration is said to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the shortage of applicants in a future @-@ oriented manner .
the overall concept should orient@@ ate internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service sick or age @-@ related .
high time to act so that no more jobs are left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter races , group leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he caused a rotten surprise for a long time already in the circle of circles when he questioned the personnel costs in public and the rest of the parties were amazed .
people want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t arrive at a satisfactory solution in the short term , the administrative district with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the or@@ bit@@ ed cities - should seek a home tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than the public service tari@@ ff actually fores@@ ees .
the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available if one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution law .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few personnel .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti , in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; Jugend Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team had worked effectively with human traders in a way facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation since one year , refused to comment on the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October .
it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are supplied to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can ride off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such coincidence supposedly occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s record , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected to over@@ ride the authority of the Italian Co@@ ast@@ guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign up , Nobel Prize winner is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
Minn@@ iti says in the meantime that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors bear fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe .
An@@ sti@@ ege and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berliner Ou@@ ter out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate to enjoy tri@@ als and sights for four days .
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view points followed , partly on towers , from which one could see far more than the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream planes .
in between there were always long climbs for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
again , a look@@ out point at the look@@ out point , connected through &quot; flew &quot; tri@@ ples and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days many altitude metres were announced .

in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers gathered in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium healing Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group got to know the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally - .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in future instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium ramp@@ s during wind and weather ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this has also recognized the first federal agencies who are increasingly involved in this field . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport division in the middle of July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; we hope to am@@ a@@ ze entirely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There are still a lot of clubs on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organised the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
apart from Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile consul@@ ted an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , you could be more often present in these markets online more often than just send the League message to Asia once a year .
what is it all about ?
computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or the football simulation FIFA play a competitive level during E @-@ sport .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since become established in which the professionals compete against each other .
in 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it a real sport ?
for many , the idea is getting used to getting used to .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has also dealt with the question for a long time .
for the professor at the Deutsche Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show lots of biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classic sports such as increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
in addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid response .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and look for nutrition .
&quot; the F@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but they also have problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is getting more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform with online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are internationally on the move , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no inter@@ cultural barriers .
a study by the company consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in e @-@ sport .
in 2016 , 50 million Euros were implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
sales are expected to be 130 million in three years .
against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte Consul@@ tants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
international are many countries already .
big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport competition providers Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot happening in Europe too .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as instruc@@ tional subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing .
according to D@@ utt , the soccer league clubs in the Netherlands and France have meanwhile ple@@ dged to set up an e @-@ sport section .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison Germany is la@@ gging behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Board R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer sufficient .
the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digit@@ alized world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything stays the same in football as it always was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and downward @-@ looking eyes than she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown any regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance which they regret completely . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even her mental illness had a significant effect on her actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy saying that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no day in which I do not waste the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I am going with everything . I try to be there for eternity in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; persecuted &quot; by the knowledge that she would never participate in her brother &apos;s wedding or would be an a@@ unt for his children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer the only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will keep in keeping with myself for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was killed by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , jump from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the moments before his suicide , she wrote : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Any@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by Roy &apos;s death and ordered that she should benefit from any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter was Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ ich : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ ich was allowed to run the Audi Cup as a captain is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern will have a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm since .
there was something different in his place in the cabin , that Joshua Kim@@ es immediately saw me , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups no Philipp Geh@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made the rush to his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the character of the coach as well .
not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had grown from youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday .
sugar is best distributed to those with a lot of trust that you want to keep in your mood .
so , those who have been chosen to compete in Lah@@ m &apos;s heritage can only use a little extra motivation .
Kim@@ mir confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ ats over the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m .
right back , that &apos;s his position , the white binder on the arm did the rest .
and at all Kim@@ i worked in this initial formation like the one who can take the ru@@ dder in his hand .

he had a look for the whole while many others were occupied with themselves .
V@@ idal hopes to survive his lack of fitness ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches then , on the devil , get out of the services of the Asian trip ( folded also only conditional ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le would not have noticed neg@@ atively in their first appearance in the Bayern @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both operated sovereign .
the Nami@@ bian @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm proved to be difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le also tried to succeed in the building up a few times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wasn &apos;t as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance during his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also taken for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as un@@ accustomed this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one could see in connection to the game .
Ru@@ dy , for example , gave in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs not one or two , but determined six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ ber said goodbye to his new fellow players after a few sn@@ app@@ y remarks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win every game with Bayern . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : Wirtschaft lo@@ oses bis@@ sings pace
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak to T V @-@ requ@@ esting a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; knowledge sei@@ zes the desires of the economy that has all blocked Lem@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nat@@ us sees the biggest turn@@ around in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now the top priority in the country &apos;s priority list .
this year the ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is the right to build up the building .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ ming Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the federal marketing plan .
the goal is to put the track into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ erial spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees this as a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competitive companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) Trier is striving for a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ label to boost sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports bag@@ ging for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier has an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces in the new Master Bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is envis@@ aged for the passed championship test and 2500 euros , if graduates start their own hands after the master training within ten years .
however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction there are quick facts to be created , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier .
to date , only 29 new jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers working in the state enterprise Wis@@ sing .
the Chamber of Commerce demands to award more orders to external offices .
Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , CD@@ U Group vice @-@ president , refers to calculations by the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country has invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as to how to remedy the shortage of skilled labour in the region .
di@@ sil@@ lu@@ sion@@ ing is also the previous broad@@ band expansion in the country .
in 2016 , regional companies had only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a rating of 3.@@ 4 .
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and out@@ breaks .
ex @-@ Minister of Economy E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the Wind power company Pro Wind .
the Gre@@ ens Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private higher education institution in Karlsruhe - where after four months it had already cleared the field because of dis@@ agreements .
Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW stated that it would be able to upgrade the software to more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles .
the BMW Chairman said that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a call back .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutr@@ alizing the exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also becoming what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of obsc@@ uring the mighty car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions .
in the United States several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the win of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that also the Is@@ ar visitors participate , a raft through Munich , which has a special message on Saturday morning .
if you go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , you will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ b@@ ach@@ brücke .
and that is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Construction Department wants to clear up .
on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ otran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to be sharpen@@ ed as a sensitive game of game . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft fell over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter of the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most widely published carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film .
his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist , he worked among other things as a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo shapes rom@@ p in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing table today , works almost ten hours a day .
through cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his cute characters continue to find much spread worldwide .
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack @-@ of @-@ all @-@ fil@@ ler as a counterpart .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are going to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series which , like its original drawings , is produced without wor@@ dless .
Lav@@ ender from Provence threatened with climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
la@@ ven@@ der is decreasing due to the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought , and because of the diseases transmitted by diseases , which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , cause great headaches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the Agr@@ arian Research Institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .
this has an impact on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is also a small zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacteria that transfers the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1@@ 200@@ th anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and stomach @-@ feelings range .
there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the bodies pile up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to took office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries .
among the latter is her publisher and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , the co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is deeply felt even though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , carry T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings connected with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely tried by journalists .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ separ@@ able and even though the terrain is now more pu@@ zzling .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of Ri@@ odo@@ ce newspaper in the province capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing about Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the country &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields , as rival fac@@ tions struggle to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug king@@ doms that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez had become aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with the blame he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fra@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , gu@@ essing members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was not to comp@@ el Val@@ dez , after requ@@ esting another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .
in 2003 , he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without hitting the drug @-@ toxic@@ ity problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper gained a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
eight years after the founding of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever she was leading .
he gave up voluntarily that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you need to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ? why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ man , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Gui@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Was his love for routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death has forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean businesses , their secret start and landing ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
if it smells false , stay away from it .
the anger is , said the publisher of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened with Ja@@ vier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce met for safety training , no mobile phones were allowed . days earlier , it became known that Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size quarter of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen whom the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy .
it &apos;s months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ o@@ dol@@ ce has posted three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of the former famous Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures concentrated on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was ab@@ duc@@ ted or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealer and authorities .
a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who listened to the reign@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated almost the entire century all political levels .
recently several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of high @-@ cali@@ ber cases of corruption .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military assault .
only a few months earlier readers had viewed the Val@@ dez column as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we knew what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken down with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was devoted to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it &apos;s his .
journalists have become lou@@ der all over the country by putting them down in organized protests , &quot; S@@ OS Press , &quot; on foot@@ paths and buildings .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez Ram@@ i@@ rez acc@@ uses the authorities to spy on journalists and release them because they have said the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her obj@@ ectivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and an equally valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media guard group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note signed by Z@@ et@@ as @-@ Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lie next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua following the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava B@@ reach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists escaped from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking sc@@ ared him .
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became a re@@ porter , &quot; he said .
at midnight on the last Friday when the last issue was finished , the writers of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their tel@@ eph@@ ones began to bu@@ zz .
a series of shooting with rival ri@@ vals and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell &apos;s em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
from the cur@@ b edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens stood nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez had a look at the polic@@ emen who kept watch to see if they were willing .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his footsteps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you just think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if on the same day that Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send it to the street . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have now found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his fla@@ ky skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sustain@@ ing ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered species of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier living in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well received state has start@@ led researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on March 21 , 2011 .
he met on something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy earth @-@ cl@@ ump .
after all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum where the creature is to be seen .
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ rs models - Mon@@ a Lisa the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , even though it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique that is known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and can now be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ edly after the museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to carefully uncover it .
the astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ ors over his body .
they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by enough pressure by meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals who use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of roe deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , indicating that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; powerful predat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r shows how danger@@ ously the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors have been the chal@@ k time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , fell into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sun@@ k on his back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are likely much farther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ served fla@@ ky skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just sp@@ it a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it &apos;s asleep . &quot;
the chal@@ k time was a time when gigantic ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his fear@@ some ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada on 21 March 2011 .
according to the museum , it is the sustain@@ ing ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes that hung from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es have been swept through the western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater cre@@ mation of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as rare as winning a lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
preserved remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
his right front foot is at his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales at its sole . &quot;
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : just under 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , miles long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
around 20 people were injured on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
according to the police , at 17.@@ 00 o &apos;clock between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) there were just under 30 vehicles , including trucks .
at first there are no indications of the exact number of the injured .
it was light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilometer long back @-@ back was formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , there came also a lot of G@@ aff@@ er on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities .
the fire bri@@ gade noted the characteristics of the vehicle mil@@ ker , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 hrs a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
it was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group test@@ et &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing investig@@ ates in the train and sleeps .
or you are deeply immersed in his work and have just a genius idea .
and then : buff@@ ered .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes one uns@@ af@@ e or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn ( Deutsche Bahn ) is currently testing the cost @-@ free ticket inspections .
it is easy to confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and use it to get the ticket .
currently , a test run is running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be available in Germany in early next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a railway spokesperson . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use it , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have booked an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
it is also necessary to purchase the train , the DB Navig@@ ator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking .
and last but not least , you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works like this : you get into the train , calling his ticket under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will then appear with the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seats Y .
if the train driver arrives at the ticket inspection at number Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , work on , keep silent .
check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , simply check the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , the Marketing board of DB correspondence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second Plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often drive train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the greatest anno@@ y@@ ances .
because often one has , in any case , one of the fellow travellers not all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document that you have to assign .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ d@@ ants and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling one &apos;s ticket and the conductor takes time to take care of other matters .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just the connection ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to its core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , she sat in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post from someone from the high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused as no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being saved on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old man who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , M@@ on .
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body which was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new to them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return later in the evening to twe@@ ets on people on the Can@@ field Drive .
there were photos of the police band and people that cried out , and of a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police killed just my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live feed , where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman ass@@ ures his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the type of murder we get used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in cinem@@ as from 11 .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a flower @-@ dress and a fitting crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; about the black experience and the black state &quot; countless times before this morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be raised therein .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves .
even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter met with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s figure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , notic@@ ing that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything has come . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l into the mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community which benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , together with six other locals the Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets team followed . &quot; in the years following browser sho@@ ot@@ ings .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people will be portrayed , for so I will be represented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ isation of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ells &apos; history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; and we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not affir@@ mati@@ sed type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film on account of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coincidence , though it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it describes the social @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a chaos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a singing and she feels bound to this memory , since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves the people , although it has not been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area spl@@ its the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the subject hardly leaves the subject cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) .
while supporters rely on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , from which the other shops are benef@@ iting , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
with the beginning of the construction work , it will be finished .
the gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Bed@@ a place with the possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been buying in the farmers market almost weekly for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ladies are very happy again and again .
we discovered the but@@ ch@@ ery for us as well .
we would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , this is also possible .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping centre in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think this is superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are plenty of them in our city .
you can see how many shop shops here are empty - some have been around for months and years .
but since there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive .
as you can see shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
it &apos;s a pity that there are almost no special shops and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
first of all : where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming .
or does the ghost @-@ bit gallery already manage to drive all the stores out of Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it won &apos;t work .
and a shopping center that is empty doesn &apos;t need anybody .
in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall there is no place thanks to the crazy many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg no more .
once the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible , hanging from the ceiling on cables .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year sentence after having publicly posted diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg whose discipline unified her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg developed the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA extracted from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , a sharp , although somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations , but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft .
her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing sits comfortably on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA @-@ portrait .
the artist and her det@@ ained M@@ use have become un@@ equal partners who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a comic &quot; soup magazine , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the president should convert chel@@ ated judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , requiring Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome type of happy coincidence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to further infl@@ ame the rigid mind@@ sets that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing signed an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; which has been the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a jack @-@ of @-@ all of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de based on the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .
it shows Mann@@ ing , as she appears with a hands @-@ on phone in the hand from the disciplinary bra@@ ins of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they tell your words , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so don &apos;t stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia .
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les , which gather together like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ bor@@ k from the portraits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its release . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for murder sought
a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man has been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued an arrest warrant for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the files of the Local Court of Cook County show .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died , 26 , after several stab@@ s died .
a joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27th .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the place of action , and det@@ ectives examine the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ them has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cub@@ bage , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them should now be in absence and were excluded from entering the campus of the Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal liability examined by the competent authorities , and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urged the susp@@ ects to submit to the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities will help find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip saying that something happened in apartment 100@@ 8 .
the police described the scene as being very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister , Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re @-@ installing R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything will be implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigations approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are going through the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
M@@ amma &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian selling point of r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains disputed positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from WA@@ DA in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal of WA@@ DA in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the Moscow Organization in July , WA@@ DA @-@ General Director Olivier Nig@@ gli , explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moves in the right direction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be used again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs for the time being
the company groups shared this with them .
it was a mere precau@@ tion that no health impairment could be assumed , it was said in the communication .
from now on only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on a fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ loss medication .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency with its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys didn &apos;t work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not mo@@ urn the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce hair care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from the outside to help .
a new breed of human resources start @-@ ups is at growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , staff anonym@@ ity and complaint management hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive Officer of Red@@ wood City start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the S@@ nap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can re@@ boot , why .
companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber that has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished .
for start @-@ ups like G@@ LIN@@ T this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps businesses prevent and recognize bad behaviour , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which employees can report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the public opinion condem@@ ns the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and CEO of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often an in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees .
now that the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of employment experience , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the risk management group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance that takes the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with the total capital raised to $ 47 million .
he secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and donated his entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only deplo@@ y@@ ments .
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is thei@@ rs , and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel stronger to make this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well . businesses run well when employees are committed and engaged .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can produce disappointment and dem@@ oti@@ v@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you are wondering about 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management firm of Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too heavily on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow fellow workers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after the gathering of feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company is gaining new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better bon@@ dage of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover .
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano .
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose your customers , you will lose business .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers chat on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their jer@@ sey top parts and show the back of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour practice before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday was scheduled for Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 o &apos;clock in order to meet the already packed schedules of the players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day at which the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises .
they should do 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before the start of formal playing preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said he was supporting the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the multi @-@ stak@@ ed routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this tremendous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they plac@@ ard on , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear si@@ delines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been cleared with foot@@ balls , which will be a protective grid behind a door post , will not be an easy task .
bro@@ ther@@ board players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then stop there to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it is a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect potential mis@@ concep@@ tions and send them to fac@@ tual reviews that may display results of the fact check out of the original article .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the major distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential elections .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks are supposed to be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts check would be started .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aside from the knowledge which stories are challenged by fac@@ tual reviews of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a cosm@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says wa@@ ving . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story has been illustrated by another British artist , Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : in 2014 he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .
&quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
and letters always smell like smoke ; for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were himself .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome pit &quot; ) it all seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape painters , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he drank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and started writing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years , &quot; in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said , &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , maps depicting what possessed something : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; guys , let everything go their way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book with the title &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was depicted in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; gentlemen seemed to be quite a ga@@ unt@@ let , always pay debts and spend money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ males sol@@ der their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se land@@ ins . &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences
he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to finish with the dam@@ n life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf covered
with the un@@ v@@ eiling of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team around Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the cul@@ mination of the campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too beautiful for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Chapel of the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think this ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their website that was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in essence , we are firmly convinced that we , as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer , are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is necessary to form@@ ulate an all @-@ standing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
finally she stands in competition with other local authorities .
the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign for a medium five @-@ figure sum .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ re@@ es and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so too this week .
at first glance , it is a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as in the past , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
at the meetings , under the head of the He@@ ads of State , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Ministers were also present .
as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number of over@@ nights .
the government pul@@ ls the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged ties to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a re@@ pul@@ ler of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 people who have been involved directly in the coup attempt , this week is being negotiated in Ankara .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the put@@ sch , Erdo@@ gan had called the attempt to overthrow the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean@@ se &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army under control ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published an article entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Im@@ medi@@ ate in military headquarters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head ban on soldiers , wrote the paper .
in any case , the large @-@ scale coach of the army and the security forces continues .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was firing another 73@@ 95 state servants by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed as though Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were earlier than the actual masters of the country .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan was pushing the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is doing targeted an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution in foreign countries , warned that the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years .
if that happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
in any case , there is doubt about the deployment of the Turkish army in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
he prefers to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do this by changing the way citizens are spent in other countries &apos; green cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to refurb@@ ish track for airport shuttle
again and again over the past few months have been cont@@ ested about the future of racing sh@@ utt@@ les - now it is supposed to be quite fast .
before the end of the year , it is supposed to be built on the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated route on which the tourist train de@@ parts .
in order to secure the future of the racing sh@@ utt@@ les in the long term , construction work is to begin on the route according to the Ministry of Transport this year .
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country acknow@@ le@@ dges its commitment to tourism , &quot; declared the Minister for Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
he estimated the costs for the repair of the track to some 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country over@@ took 75 percent .
the contract , based on which the shuttle should also be ordered in the future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alized , stated S@@ üh@@ l .
the ministry and the Süd@@ th@@ ür@@ ingen railway as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the race stei@@ g Shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g shuttle is a popular rail link between the railway stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , a pilot plant has been tested to determine whether the route is used by a large number of people to re@@ order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t be cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of the sex robot is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascen@@ sion seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail .
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey in the publication of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes more disturbing as many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin .
the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xi Gold Sex @-@ Ro@@ bot , developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold has a personality that suits your personality as best as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so she likes what you like and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - last but not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent feminine features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when you move a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , troubled one most .
on his website , True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ yl@@ ated with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy@@ ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or simply a different sex toy .
its emergence and its increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something Dun@@ kl@@ eres and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notes their increasing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what is se@@ eping out of the edge @-@ zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots show up at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House who has spra@@ yed to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most dre@@ ad@@ ful aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the po@@ ke eyes , but how realistic this vision appears .
the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background story , nothing that interpre@@ ts independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the expression of 2017 : ma@@ ids
s@@ ling@@ backs Large performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all preten@@ ding to blow up our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of tr@@ umps to bring families together .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long occupied himself with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which they fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
for the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it is in another context that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push all of us to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and dr@@ unk@@ ers , we refer to the sp@@ ook@@ y possibility that his k@@ itt@@ ens of one day will no longer be ej@@ ected .
however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Republi@@ can of the Right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; that suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness compared to its standards .
I find myself today by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ic version of the decline - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked out ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild crime .
if Tr@@ ump is going , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in town , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are kn@@ ur@@ ry and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ ming music con@@ veys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience , as here are two 2 @-@ year @-@ olds , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ se@@ ven@@ ties and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not required .
the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ used , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a visit to the hospital .
last year , due to the treatment of cuts , he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts . according to the prison authorities , he suffered a fall in his cell .
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , when he shot them several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a on her .
Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he kept his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal against the six @-@ year sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that it is too len@@ i@@ ent .
the National Criminal Law Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the acqu@@ itt@@ al could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the fourth @-@ door students from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into their vac@@ ations and schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school manager An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol for the dis@@ miss@@ al , 29 students of the four classes elected Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der a young eagle rising up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lively Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the poultry farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it hat@@ ched by his chickens .
instead of a chicken breast a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making him a hen fell , and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les who wore the cylinders to make the bet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Eagle stands for integration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schul@@ leiter An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the kit@@ ten is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a hen .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every district cler@@ k to feel accepted in his new school .
this was followed by a letter of thank@@ sgiving to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who always jumps at teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &apos; representatives .
the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over now , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher .
she left her pup@@ il very reluct@@ ant after two years , because it was a really great time .
finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door wat@@ cht@@ ower .
in conclusion , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
in this process , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first @-@ class students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , announced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .
on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally camping people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while a study is underway .
the State Department reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have sharpen@@ ed control of the free camping and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es .
the controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do Diesel drivers need to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel @-@ summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group offer software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they should improve the emissions behaviour of cars from emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
no , the software updates tra@@ ded are optional .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have auth@@ oring software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) has ordered its retro@@ fitting .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler advised to notify every person concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done within the framework .
how long will the change@@ over take place altogether ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it depends on manufacturers &quot; commitment and political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
what do drivers who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE recommends to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a threat of a massive decline in the price of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE fears this .
but in the regions where driving b@@ ans threaten .
in rural areas , there are so far no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE recommends to wait for a sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the prestigious awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the honored .
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host and collaborate with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner , Le@@ ar , announced with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced the intention of taking part in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to neg@@ lect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ve them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to clarify her point of view .
the Kennedy Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city liv@@ able
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ lach &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the position is already written - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been the City Engineer since 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as he medi@@ ates in the press brief@@ ing .
he reports on diverse , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
so - taking into account the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision .
since Has@@ lach works for the administrative community as a sub@@ contractor , the applicant has to present relevant conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it would not be able to fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but citizens &apos; clos@@ eness is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate as well as good spirits between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot are initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and stadium renovation is still a topic .
the latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is a great scope for a city architect .
with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening you can react flexibly to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the ol@@ d@@ town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what is in tune with , &quot; if new buildings are approved , the out@@ going Stadt@@ bau@@ meister emphasizes .
the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister is already responsible for this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is the client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end everything runs on my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

this is because continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .

bicycle on lines thrown : South railway line locked
according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) to the lines .
these were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them since the night hours .
a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed near the scene of the crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a country of Lausanne , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch at AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who or the perpetr@@ ators themselves would have brought themselves into great danger and also end@@ anger the train traffic .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of railway traffic , even the pat@@ rons of the railway customers could be sent to the perpetr@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , to go out of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage had been repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south railway line could be guided without obstruc@@ tions .
nearly ten people had dropped out Friday afternoon , two of them were in correspondence .
freight trains did not fall out , but they delayed .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims the exact opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the inc@@ urable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intest@@ ine .
the senior researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna explained that immune cells pat@@ rol in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food are not penet@@ rated into the body .
cells that can trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in its initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. rep@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote a more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral student Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was but separated , did not have this .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of the mice had to be done - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. rep@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system , the researchers made L. rep@@ ter@@ i grow in a liquid and then led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed into the tolerant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as the In@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but if tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that humans have the same intoler@@ ance @-@ promoting cells , such as mice , and that most of us protect L. cross@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria .
the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , when people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the preparation Asia tour of the blues and managed just 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him sooner than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his start XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of his four primary new commitments .
&quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new depth stop for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns out : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the head of the SPD , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers still looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only no fire from the party centre , but no opposite wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus continue to watch the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals .
what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with head@@ wind .
there were set@@ backs .
and one after the other .
the federal CD@@ U looks after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; this shows once again : red @-@ green can simply not be controlled reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fraction of a Gre@@ ens MP has thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the state election , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green Party executive Michael Kell@@ ner sum@@ mon@@ ed El@@ ke T@@ westen combined with Lower Saxony , to return her mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear distortion of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German Federal Executive Officer and Ele@@ ction Manager of the Green Party to the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an SPD election fighter , when on Friday morning the new message message reached the party headquarters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands for CD@@ U without his own government majority following the merger of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen .
it is the temporary high point of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the misery began with the unexpected clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
a blue eye , not more , cal@@ med down the comrades at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
this became the case - and indeed , everything was much worse .
the defeat in Kiel shot the SPD in stag@@ gering , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sm@@ ashed the party smoothly .
the comrades struggle ti@@ res@@ ome in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just kno@@ cked out new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and with him came the next set@@ back .
mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD member of the SPD , lost his Nim@@ bus on that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he did everything wrong about what can be done wrong .
since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival .
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
due to the VW gas atmosphere and its role on the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critic@@ ised for some time now .
mi@@ ese sales figures were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .
they let him go , as they promised by Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
in doing so Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal co@@ er@@ cion of the Lower Saxony countryside .
and Schulz did not at all .
for the time being , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
her anger is directed against the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the back@@ war@@ dly ent@@ our@@ age parliam@@ ent@@ arians T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen combined their own career interests on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as a direct candidate because of her personality but on the national list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens in the parliament , according to the Lower Saxony parliament .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the number of voters four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a leading candidate to the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career giving away a future CD@@ U member is fal@@ si@@ fying the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fying the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding for local core III
those who want to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
the mayor , Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler , and three representative St@@ eg city development on Wednesday in sens@@ ations .
at the beginning of the information session , Sch@@ ind@@ ler again gave a review of what happened so far .
since 1991 , there have been san@@ itation areas .
back then , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to promote inner development , not only to open up new areas of construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on April 4 , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Government Pres@@ i@@ dency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; received the information that there will be a re@@ development area III . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sum of funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500@@ ,000 Euros will come from the country , the rest from the municipality .
how is a re@@ development area now being developed ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will , according to Sch@@ ind@@ ler , continue to investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether there is interest in the planned territory .
if necessary , the territorial boundaries may shift again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basement presented the contents of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; federal state program in which the restructuring would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the program is the re@@ vit@@ alization of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and developing the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out object @-@ related , i.e. per plot .
the re@@ development area would then be defined as a constitution .
since January 1 , 2017 , the grant period for the funding is still running until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the inventory takes place only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire .
in November or December as far as possible the stat@@ ute decision should be made , so that the renov@@ ations can begin in the coming year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commun@@ e must carry out the said preventive examinations .
it is a matter of assessing the urban development of the situation and deciding when it will be rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
for the respective plot there will be a mention in the land register as well .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come back to his senses and make a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
this is why there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and plot arch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which it is concerned about the structural condition and the rehabilitation prospects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing District &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential space can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Business Ar@@ ch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new construction measures were not eligible .
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also emphasized that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - whoever comes first comes first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t make subsidies for later &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reserve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; local core II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .

the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per castle .

the White House adver@@ ts cost tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military specification given to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited beside a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire@@ fighter and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order or Fra@@ go , barely thirty hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the helicopter Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , deputy commander of the naval aviation command .
the news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 , and so long it was until the tur@@ f was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 that night .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the confin@@ ement of the hours of service .
the original crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground on the aircraft during the time .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the commander wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as the official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he advoc@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from poli@@ tico @-@ beneficial purposes .
pres@@ idents are required to use them for the journey .
but demanding their use only for a photo operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft performed in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that are compla@@ ining about the use of the presi@@ ding plane by his predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is thrilled by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area in order to dep@@ ose the US president in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany in early July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 exercise courses at the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Non @-@ Pres@@ idential Support missions &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers accepted the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps introduced at the event .
a Si@@ kor@@ sky spokesperson said that the company had not been involved in expos@@ ing the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget labels for the presidential ou@@ ghs , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the US Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; setting the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion .
at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the helicopter for the event .
&quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
it is , of course , appropriate to emphasize that . &quot;
it was not clear if Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his own tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck .
in the White House Tr@@ ump told representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss Face to Kne@@ e Task
fron@@ trun@@ ner of the Second Tennis Federal League starts at the 3rd Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
despite five games still imp@@ ec@@ cable balance , the leader of the Second Tennis League has retained the sense of reality .
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that is always playing in quite a similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially on the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the far north are above all concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ova ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ se@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump did not really feel happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress sealed some &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ amed the US blast .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft plans to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors of local O@@ MV have been al@@ armed , which together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea North Stream 2 .
the threat of dr@@ ones is enormous .
however , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions even by Executive Order .
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at which the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in the hit series of Net@@ fli@@ x becomes the center of attention

roll back : the city provides 46 kitchen benefits
the city organis@@ es the Ch@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the municipal kinder@@ gar@@ tens the clock is turned back .
the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) in the town of Kre@@ feld on 1st September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cook will continue to cook in addition to the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers fresh boiled tea .
the town runs 46 day@@ care centres in Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time .
in the last year of Kit@@ a@@ year 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the demand grows continuously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children who take care of 45 hours of lessons have lunch in the day@@ time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour service when children stay until 2@@ pm . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have kitchen service from 1st September : they warm up the delivered food , complement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , proportion@@ ate the meal individually , give the meal off , clean up , wash and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as sevent@@ een units - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen workers are now a member of the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this is also the case : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita premises - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign exchange for the city as the most economical one , it is from the press office .
and this although 46 part @-@ time employees are re @-@ hired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so much in weight at about 750 people in education , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , head of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of the vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said in a statement on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban issued threats against a choice process that coinci@@ ded with the transition from international comb@@ at@@ ants to an advisory role .
this year , the elections for the first time will be handed over to the government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ some said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of registered 3.6 million voters .

men try to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 have tried to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl on Thursday .
according to police information , the men were talking about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who kept up with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 P.@@ M. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s phone .
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and went on with her friends .
then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to grab the mobile phone and necklace of the girl , which however failed .

G@@ MB concern about investing in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union wants to make sure that the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow &apos;s factory in Glasgow is assured by Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s managers .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which , in addition to other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s call for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; voice concerns that financing for modernis@@ ing production lines will not be pushed forward &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organ@@ izer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; the fact that we are unable to gain clarity about our business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross is deeply affected by our members .
generations of families have worked here , and the labour forces are strongly focused on the local community and Glasgow &apos;s large space , an important pillar of decent employment in a field of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a fl@@ ori@@ zing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the Fili@@ al leader at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we value continuous engagement with employees and union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed openly .
we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continuously monitor our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . if our operations are changing at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La Liga may be of interest to Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main won &apos;t leave N@@ ey@@ mar in pursuit of a £ 18@@ 9 million offer to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack ?
the sensational approach has spark@@ ed the transfer window in the summer , as the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is mad about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan board insi@@ sts that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
when Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign up , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening the 34 year old came from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW at 7.@@ 55 a.m. on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au towards Le@@ ese .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to escape to the right .
in doing so , the Tour@@ an rider tou@@ red the guard rails .
the car was damaged by material damage .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann writes .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; Wir sind Kirche , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he expected from former Regensburg bishop and present @-@ day car@@ dinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deepest regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ises that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are measured in reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
regarding the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , Histori@@ an and Member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like going to the church and that &apos;s a fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; furthermore , she pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows were a normal educational means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for past decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the abuse , pop@@ e @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger , writes completely wrong@@ ly , translated into 12 languages .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is written in the 440 @-@ page report , which the lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted to the En@@ ligh@@ tenment asked by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen became victims of over@@ print , 67 domain spar@@ rows sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases the masters of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister were used to form forms of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be more violent .
however , in contrast to many other accus@@ ations , many victims estimate that many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen station Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence Ex@@ erc@@ ises on Protection Quar@@ ter@@ ly at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ ol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a cathedral kit didn &apos;t bring a top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you analyse this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears in it at all .
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
also the exc@@ esses in the pre @-@ school ex@@ propri@@ ated itself outside of its sphere of influence .
at best it is possible to repro@@ ach him , to experience it too late or not to have taken first indications seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as &quot; Rede@@ mption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world &quot; by virtually all respon@@ dents .
the vast majority of his students George R@@ atz@@ inger also provides an excellent certificate , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hearted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; intel@@ li@@ gible , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and was &quot; always surrounded by children . &quot;
only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to break@@ downs .
the fact that he did not only b@@ ang with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor , but also dealt face sla@@ p and twisted too che@@ ek@@ y guys at the hair or ears , he himself admitted even years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
it must be said , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the period between the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers .
do you know such breeding methods as well ?
of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .
I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um .
compared to what it is all about in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are Bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders whether it is not related to his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media has just r@@ ushed on him .
many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pop@@ e are still working di@@ lig@@ ently .
but the truth is : the report releases Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , in connection with the report , there has been a lot of reports on abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also involved in any involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an sad@@ dest representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims of shame remain silent .
if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a chor@@ us who professionally had been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students assess R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role with regard to the abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; concerning sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... Bu@@ ben have more intru@@ sive or clear or even more open than their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust teachers etc .
talking to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the report concludes with a clear conclusion : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him could not be confirmed as part of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus acqu@@ itted of every acquain@@ tance .
in this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented or brought him to the display .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgu@@ sting crimes , as happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the media at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looking down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem , that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is precisely the abuse of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violent exc@@ esses as well as , we say , other repro@@ aches .
in addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which the boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly har@@ assed and portrayed , and suffered terri@@ bly , were all acquired at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there were really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with them Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys face only when they were already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ en@@ gym@@ nasi@@ um .
on the one hand , as most witnesses stressed , the theme of &quot; primary school &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you were only happy to escape and enjoy the much better treatment and for many even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was a lot of discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
at the most , the repro@@ ach still remains to have looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time in the year 1970 / 71 , when he had just started to establish himself and of the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible , ( as the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then only back in 1993 .
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger stick to the ears consistently in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ en@@ gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the pre @-@ school , the punishment will continue to be practiced &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the face of the danger of negative press release , he recommended urgent action .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , as testing pun@@ ishments were also banned in Bavaria for a long time .
before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows .
it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but you can &apos;t say that he has always looked away .
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the examination of schools in Bavaria was officially abol@@ ished .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Thur@@ n and Ta@@ xis asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time .
how do you see this ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; trap of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of judging the past of today &apos;s moral standards .
the princess is already right .
but this , of course , does not apply to sexual abuse that has been ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and not for what has been sm@@ ashed in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the then practice of that time .
this is all very aw@@ ful and I am glad that it will finally be re@@ worked .
but at the same time I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means for discipl@@ ining and punishment , i.e. to draw ear @-@ files and to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies .
when physical punishment was forbidden , he kept strictly adher@@ ing to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject matter of Prü@@ fer also come to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI said , from his perspective , as the domains played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not hide in any way that he led a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even this must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world @-@ class institution , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and candy alone you don &apos;t even make a big singer and stand in front of every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and experienced over and over again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , deep @-@ minded , deeply beli@@ ever and heart @-@ loving person , from which one can not imagine that he could only do something for a fly .
I regularly get in touch with him , like many former dom@@ ites , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ tation , regularly contact him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .
those who did not forgive him until now , that he was once strict with them , are clearly in the minority .
most domain spar@@ rows are grateful to him today for having enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , patri@@ arch@@ al teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect@@ ful person to which they still look up today and which they almost rever@@ e .
and please , once more clearly : all that is acc@@ ru@@ ed to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent that is behind it all too obvious .
the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves the burden on him .
now the stand @-@ up , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany &apos;s probably nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
