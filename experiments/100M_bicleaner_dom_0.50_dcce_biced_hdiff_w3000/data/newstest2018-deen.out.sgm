<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A ren prison, where youngsters are supposed to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel, where it is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners farm the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this, who had to get upset, because the car Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas of Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but therefore very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and villages have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the big picture postcard, more detailed maps, so-called original compositions, were incorporated into towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the Bavarian Measurement Management, these were originated between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first measurement of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if French troops finally departed from Lunéville's peace of 9 February 1801, it was today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project further, founded the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus Bayerisches Vermessaging Administration." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition for Munich dates back to 1856 and is to be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison in the morning / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, i.e. in 1877, in Munich's district.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: in the zooming appears a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered flatlands from the so-called "Urption" from which the basic tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant" "" "land in sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the location of the October festival in 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of the today's district, Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "at the guest's dough" or on the rise "On the air" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße people were once locked up with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based district Irish" "" "On the Auer Luves" "" "was created." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - a psychiatrist in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended up buying the so-called" "" "Irren" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he prohibited the personnel from using force against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who worked for an exhibition with the prison.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients there was first room, later it was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirasylum facility in Haar, 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Isar-Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in Munich's Salesianum are now facing the site of the former Auer Institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football field of the TSV Munich Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural reference to the original structure of the asylum facility, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was listed as" "" "main place" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">In December 1944, the Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn (S-Bahn) track will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial image of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racial assaults of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"" "" "" "the NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which will come into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racially-based incidents occur in the entire state and will be noted here," "" "said the Group's opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="53">A recent law by Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state, which are disproportionately aimed at minorities, led the group to issue the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear discomfort in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no gasoline during his journey through the state and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report from the Missouri general prosecutor's office in which it is shown that black drivers in the state are reported to be 75 percent more common than whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people need to be ready to take deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">In 2015, Missouri reported 100 crimes of hate, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report programme which ranks the state in terms of the number of violations of the country's 16th rank.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing and employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws encouraging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration detention, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">The electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fisherman Weideviln project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies, representatives of the Fischer's CDU trade association met at the square yard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his operation, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplying 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is for him the alternative marketing way for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "as he is also BLHV Chairman of Fisherman's bach, he called the" "" "elementary importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot make profitable on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides a lot of work, much needed to be processed with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not conduct bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear that" "" "the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is glad about the leader funding." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the reforestation of the areas could be dragged out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how to continue their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">"" "" "" "farmers are often criticised for funding" ""</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be forested by at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of them were promoted by leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischerbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of fences," says Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job without farmers and countrymen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiss also noted: "here, best food is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Association Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg permits the state funding of willow fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The objective is the disclosure of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Precondition is the presence of a sponsorship recorded by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">Furthermore, the enclosed area must not be towed (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">For the Fisherman's Weideaunching Project in 2018, there is currently the application of eight participants with 24 parcels, who want to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence.</seg>
<seg id="96">The estimated cost of disclosure is 35 hectares, calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred any more?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin attacking the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president's suggestions for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To be fair, Miller didn't grasp the statue itself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have liked him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he took on their importance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base.</seg>
<seg id="105">When Miller Acosta wrote: "I don't want to go into a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lightens the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is really right, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to Lazarus words, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, or your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable waste" "" "was better seen on our screens." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict, because of the significance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place her words after her death at the base - knew very well that she took a high political plot.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American Republican by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue, people from right wing wanted to change this for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty brought no one, but rather an early Neoconservatism, which brings the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty progresses.</seg>
<seg id="119">It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh was quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">Lazarus's great imaginative deed was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible travel on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And of course this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch is not to enlighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championship 2017: Neil Black praise Scottish members of the UK Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"" "the power director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championship" "" "will make a massive contribution to the team." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type at the corner of the road.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it's absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m course, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">Her captain's speech was incredible, "said Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in was great. "</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes in the world championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-distance runner Muir leads along this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that you should watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that she is "hugely proud" to the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved in medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to climb to podiums.</seg>
<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think it went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and to profit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"" "I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the heating up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything from domestic politics to its political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He smiled at the criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led as sheep for slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work to be more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And that's why the American Civil Liberties Union lamented him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's just Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is astonishingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has demonstrated a strong hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to depress his hairy head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side is a public forum, which is considered officially and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hooky people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, not trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and non-professional.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor recited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the" "" "The Post" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="188">"" "what the governors described as" "" "concentrated spam-attack" "" "would probably name" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical bodies, or to arrest and silence protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County changed the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of papers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers hit his head.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">People who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with the UK, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not silenced her.</seg>

<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumpy figures on sales increases and even more colossal sales targets, Tesla chief Elon Musk has revealed another, less glamorous figure when announcing the latest quarterly record: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk had often advertised over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car whose extradition is currently starting.</seg>
<seg id="425">Musk now dreamt: of the total of 518,000 pre-orders 63,000 had already been withdrawn.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds) "Reservation Payments."</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such non-binding reservations evaporate in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles last year.</seg>
<seg id="432">By 2018 - all models will be combined - 500,000 will be, one million in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">If you order a Model 3 today, expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla manages to drive his brand-new, never-in-practice production lines with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">However, if there are too much delays, the non-binding of reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after he had been sued by 15 countries, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce the emissions of Smog-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the changes when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"" "" "" "it is about a period that went off on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for floor-related ozone." ""</seg>

<seg id="445">Pruitt, who before his appointment by President Donald Trump, was Attorney General of Oklahoma, has long been a reliable opponent of stringent environmental regulations.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels resist.</seg>

<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has overstepped its authority than he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt proposed that its turnaround in ozone standards simply emphasised the willingness of EPA to co-operate with states by the complex process of timely fulfilling of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"under previous administrations, the EPO has often failed to comply with the deadlines for execution and then been waiting to be tried by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates its 750th anniversary of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth benefiz serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and promoters Tumblgen their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it's a unique village jewel."</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Landesbank. count Hermann von Sulz sold the Berg with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei in Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard, to which the church or the patronage belonged, and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village picture of Tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the dominating village centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 are underlining these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest continued to remain owner of this church and could also bequeath the church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The elder of the two collapsed at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell rang for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed out later during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), window panes were inserted and the bells were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops were encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the steeple and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the present tower of Turmzwerg remained a witness of the 750 year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius system from the "creative retirees" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and promoters Tumlingens invite you to the 6th serenade to St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, July 16th.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann's position speaks the final word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3: 30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">At the end of the serenade, a trunk is held in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"" "" "" "enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," "" "the organizers exhibit the fantastic view." ""</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of importance for tumours and heartwood.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and patrons of Tumlingens are particularly committed to homeland care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini affirms.</seg>

<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim defends itself" "" "has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to accept its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheimer Nette, because at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the city border to Schwalmtal.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is basically possible, but at the same time, the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">"" "such zones are meant to prevent" "" "sparing" "" "of the landscape." ""</seg>
<seg id="511">A few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided to change the land use plan to a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but that did not approve the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="512">"" "" "" "due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted approval decision is still illegal and therefore also to be taken back," "" "said Christoph Erkens, president of" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="513">The current state of affairs: before the summer break, the City Council again decided to reaffirm the zone of wind in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "Erkens:" "" "this makes it impossible to obtain permission for the establishment of wind turbines according to plan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the receipt of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "the corresponding writings have been in the circle of Viersen since last week," "" "said a speaker." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle makes it the occasion to reconsider the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">However, they do not expect the procedure to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="519">"" "with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argumentation of the association" "" "Boisheim" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Last year, the company, where the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had signed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectare site.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of the four wind turbines, electricity needs to be covered by around 11,400 households - roughly one-fifth of the power demand of all four-seater households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="684">Quantity: normally in Steinfurt in the furniture fair, once a week I will help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I have already worked at school in the open all-day.</seg>

<seg id="759">The proposal envisages to signal the investor that in this respect he does not want to throw a stick between the legs, the conclusion that saddle - which is leaning against the surrounding environment - as well as the roof-roof - which reduces the lift height and makes the construction more economical - is possible.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer does not think so.</seg>

<seg id="904">The work on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg proceeds well.</seg>
<seg id="905">On Wednesday, a seven-tonne concrete section was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="906">"" "" "" "we are very good at the time, it's great," "" "says Reinhold Leicht, foreman at the Department of Road and Transport at the Regierungspräsidium Freiburg." ""</seg>
<seg id="907">In April, the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation-needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be met.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads through the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a concrete arch bridge made of concrete, covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">As the two other bridges also, it has meanwhile arrived in the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="915">They are made of red coloured sandstone.</seg>
<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, respectively, 10,60 meters long.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach was now on the north side a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted so-called bridge cap on the north side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a peripheral attachment that is also used as an operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">On the southern part of the bridge, a 2.20 meter wide bridge deck is to be used on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway should be gone.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about this is that it concerns finished parts, a patent from the Schramberger Company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridgecaps.</seg>
<seg id="923">The laying of cables by the building in Lauterbach requires a special sense of intuition.</seg>
<seg id="924">There is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">Prior to the work, the residents were informed of the project by handouts.</seg>
<seg id="926">In addition, fish and crayfish had to be fished.</seg>
<seg id="927">For the bridges between the building yard building and the collecting house in the direction of Schramberg the traffic is controlled by a traffic light.</seg>
<seg id="928">For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance of the Lauterbach village entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Seven Linden" is completely closed.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the financial rules of Football on Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the managerial organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules that were launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy the Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can safely make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the energy rich ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to counteract legitimate revenue sources that allow them to break-even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheated and risked themselves to ruin when banks or owners relocated their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP moved from concentration on the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder business.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"" "" "" "during the current three-year FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million." ""</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has been disgraced by the Presidency of 2015, his successor Aleksander Caller will continue to frighten himself from excessive expenditures.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely, FFP is not dead and we will continue to strengthen the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, over The Associated Press last week.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package deal, it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of his contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sales revenue for the next five years can be accounted for at 44.4 million euros in the financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the hardest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the League members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season were limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overestimate their financial supervision by inflating their income by companies associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsor was to exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be considered legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This is exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided to sponsor the PSA sponsorship from the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments could come to Neymar on payments made by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will be sent and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to bypass the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">The UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke of the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival a blessing for sponsoring deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature has been signed.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymars departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS referring to the last ownership of PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, is a documentary film: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard carrot Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici whose dialogs are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an extensive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>

<seg id="1213">Fifteen accused were arrested between the age of 25 and 77 years, and arrest warrants were issued against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">In addition, the officials ensured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros.</seg>
<seg id="1215">During the same raids in Italy, two people were arrested.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living a big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, turned into Earls Court apartment in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I looked for something comparable to my price." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with her and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with an nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went into it," "" "explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is counterweight, so when you push the door, it glides very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and carry out a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have succeeded in enlarging the floor area and at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious benefit.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they don't play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square meter of some standard in something amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fighting for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an analysis of one of the largest real estate imperial Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De LUTIS lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco family founded jeans and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De LUTIS portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominating personality" - describes in the De LUTIS family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that colin property has a value of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown of real estate and cash proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the splits proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, following several failed negotiations, the first hearings of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some possessions.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both parties.</seg>
<seg id="1373">MS De LUTIS and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and deli shops from the late 1950 "s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he began Westco there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De LUTIS says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to share her property with her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De LUTIS group of companies, but Colin claims that Mark had been paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are," "" "Paul" "" "says" "" "on the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin was very reluctant, although he was a former AFL member of the AFL and after a biography from the year 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De LUTIS and their lawyers.</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to curtail the president's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to repair: poor information that comes into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information. "</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame droplets by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing," "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Mr Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit, according to six former election campaign officers, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we others do not know - that trumps would contain even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never find out about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him several times, then their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has been able to consistently prevent trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties repeatedly try to advance their own agenda by presenting the trump material that may promote their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example written by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former Trump officials say that drunkers can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with corrupted cheques, and that he tries to find out where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">Exactly this happened at the end of February when someone announced a printed copy of an article from Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet provocate Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicans or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking questions about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys's mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Most sought-after criminals receive mail from Europol</seg>

<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise will be from the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to open again on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then ambient company company ltd. on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also revenue from the local tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the fall of 2014, in view of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the District Office as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the housing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But most of all Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was to be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof in a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You will be named Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the former Hotel Birkenhof located in front of the entrance for a longer period of time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are to be done.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors were pulled out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to be done by March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>

<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities.</seg>
<seg id="1468">You don't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale city center level, Scherer emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set itself wide, explains Scherer further.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual vacationers, groups or businessmen should feel comfortable in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so Scherer.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">After the level of investment, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define exactly.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he reckons.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The outside systems are also placed on the front man, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">A large terrace is created in a courtyard, which is open to the public by the restaurant, which is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Agent Sets the Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller was said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the panel has taken up the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "on appeal to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper showed the step as a sign that Mueller had widened and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there are already initial invitations from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have purposefully intervened in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trump campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The focus of the investigation is to face several men who acted as advisors to the republicans during the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports, Mueller also examined more and more trumps of private and business environment.</seg>
<seg id="1488">A few weeks ago, the Washington Post wrote that the Special Investigator Trump had personally moved into the centre and accused the accusation whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair.</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jury is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also known as indictments.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people to take part in Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the radio station CNN, invitations were issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. also Trump Advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his dam leader Paul Manafort also attended the meeting.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the exposure showed that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Nevertheless, the implementation of the committee was the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for President Trump's concern.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President, on Thursday evening, used a speech in West Virginia to portray Russia's affair as a campaign for its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a complete invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the topic gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good" "" "because they have nothing else they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor, Ty Cobb, stated in a statement that he didn't know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But I usually work in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House approves all measures that hastened the work of the" "" "special agent" "" "in a" "" "fair" way. "" "</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that not against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed on that, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this discard, accusations against Trump had become louder, he wanted to hamper the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said before a Senate Committee in June, Trump asked him to set up the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">After the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and his employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">That sparked speculation as to whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent investigator of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later retired president Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on to the president of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented the draft laws on Thursday, after which the special promoter could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>

<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, it can be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">So far the collapsed colossus has been part of the Larsen C Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">As a result, it continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">To the north of this horseshoe the balance of waxes and abort was disturbed several years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete file of Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are some indications that the Larsen-C Schelfeis is in danger, as the front edge has never moved as far as it is currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can fall apart if a piece breaks down at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and ice so much water as it results after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen C Schelfeis is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica with nearly 50,000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University.</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the recording," "" "he confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists, whether the Larsen C Schelfeis will resume or fall back in the long run and possibly come together, his colleague Adrian Luckman added: "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not lead to the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg on climate change, many icelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature was attributable to the drop in temperature.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees, making it one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants the hourly rate at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU demands to come out of the employers association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the county day announced 41 new jobs in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 apprentices now have their first working day behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications had to be reported for the seats in this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle continues to lack staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present, there are still 50 vacant positions in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the administration is said to" "" "develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should orientate internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a" "" "competition of public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who are leaving the service sick or age-related.</seg>
<seg id="1569">High time to act so that no more jobs are left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter races, group leader of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He caused a rotten surprise for a long time already in the circle of circles when he questioned the personnel costs in public and the rest of the parties were amazed.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be reviewed which allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we don't arrive at a satisfactory solution in the short term, the administrative district with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the orbited cities - should seek a home tariff," "" "said people." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">Thus the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials than the public service tariff actually foresees.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available if one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution law.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few personnel.</seg>
<seg id="1579">Italy tightens the tone on NGO migrant rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">"" "" "" "Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they should not continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their team had worked effectively with human traders in a way facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation since one year, refused to comment on the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations currently raised after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are supplied to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can ride off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such coincidence supposedly occurred only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's record, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected to override the authority of the Italian Coastguard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian grounds and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not bring" "" "significant changes or disabilities" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign up, Nobel Prize winner is Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">Minniti says in the meantime that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Anstiege and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner Outer outpost" and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">Accommodation in the Wachenheim valley proved to be a good starting point for tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour resulted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">View points followed, partly on towers, from which one could see far more than the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream planes.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always long climbs for the long trials.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, a lookout point at the lookout point, connected through "flew" triples and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days many altitude metres were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcomed breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers gathered in the open-air inhalatorium healing Sole.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group got to know the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally -.</seg>

<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in future instead of sweating through the stadium ramps during wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">"" "" "" "this has also recognized the first federal agencies who are increasingly involved in this field." ""</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and recently the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport division in the middle of July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>

<seg id="1620">Apart from Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen has meanwhile consulted an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent E-athletes under contract, you could be more often present in these markets online more often than just send the League message to Asia once a year.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">Computer games such as "League of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA play a competitive level during E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since become established in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">In 2022, e-sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is getting used to getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobbing has also dealt with the question for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show lots of biological and physical reactions which can also be found in classic sports such as increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">In addition, it requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and look for nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the Fitte player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but they also have problems:" "" "doping is getting more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1641">A study by the company consultancy Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million Euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales are expected to be 130 million in three years.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW stated that it would be able to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW Chairman said that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," and moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles will be modified in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a call back.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of the car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralizing the exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles is also becoming what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of obscuring the mighty car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so-called depreciation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions.</seg>

<seg id="1777">Mordillo was at times one of the most widely published cartoons of cartoons, the noses of his characters are his trademark.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Even with 85, the Argentinean is still drawing and working on a film.</seg>
<seg id="1779">His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist, he worked among other things as a draughtsman for greetings cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo shapes romp in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits on the drawing table today, works almost ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his cute characters continue to find much spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">He has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.</seg>
<seg id="1790">The main person in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a jack-of-all-filler as a counterpart.</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019.</seg>

<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened with climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">Lavender is decreasing due to the conditions that are reminiscent of drought, and because of the diseases transmitted by diseases, which causes scientists and farmers who try to find solutions, cause great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the Agrarian Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"" "there is also a small zikade, a microbacteria that transfers the dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"" "Eric Chaisse said:" "" "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened." ""</seg>
<seg id="1804">"" "so we have fewer parts with essential oil." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they are supposed to take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach-feelings range.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the bodies pile up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is her publisher and her inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is deeply felt even though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodolce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, carry T-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a public prosecutor's office was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most of the thousands of killings connected with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, journalists are rarely tried by journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inseparable and even though the terrain is now more puzzling.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know the why, we distrust everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of Riodoce newspaper in the province capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "twelve river."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing about Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kingdoms that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "remember for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez had become aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the blame he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, guessing members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was not to compel Valdez, after requesting another newspaper which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">In 2003, he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to run journalism without hitting the drug-toxicity problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper gained a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee on the Protection of Journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever she was leading.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He gave up voluntarily that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you need to take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dummy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead? why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodolce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curse like a dockman, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guiabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask," "" "Was his love for routine his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death has forced them to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean businesses, their secret start and landing ways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells false, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, said the publisher of Riodolce Andres Villarreal that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodolce met for safety training, no mobile phones were allowed. days earlier, it became known that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-size quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen whom the governor himself was not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It's months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodolce has posted three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former famous Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures concentrated on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local drug dealer and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who listened to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost the entire century all political levels.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several PRI governors were accused of high-caliber cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier readers had viewed the Valdez column as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we knew what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body stature." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken down with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was devoted to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration because of another journalist at the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it's his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder all over the country by putting them down in organized protests, "SOS Press," on footpaths and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez Ramirez accuses the authorities to spy on journalists and release them because they have said the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and an equally valid society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "last year, the media guard group" "" "Articulo 19" "" "assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note signed by Zetas-Kartell: "here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lie next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists escaped from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">It is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers.</seg>
<seg id="1908">And sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz.</seg>

<seg id="1912">At midnight on the last Friday when the last issue was finished, the writers of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their telephones began to buzz.</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shooting with rival rivals and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continued to escalate as promised by a series of Kartell's embassies in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1926">"" "the report in the journal" Current Biology "" "" described him as "" "" the sustaining armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosaurier living in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"" "his unbelievably well received state has startled researchers who describe it as" "" "truly remarkable" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">It was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1931">He met on something that seemed out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy earth-clump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaurs models - Mona Lisa the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found that this herbivores, even though it is covered with a armor and resembles a shifting tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique that is known as counter-shading which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed to blend better into its surroundings and avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines for the first time in May and can now be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markedly after the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours to carefully uncover it.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armors over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It indicates that the dinosaur was hunted by enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals who use the counter-shading - think of roe deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, indicating that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "powerful predator behaviour on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerously the dinosaur predators have been the chalk time," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to study the animal on information about his life, including his preserved intestinal content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>

<seg id="1955">The chalk time was a time when gigantic theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11.5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in Current Biology believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada on 21 March 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the sustaining armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes that hung from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores have been swept through the western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>

<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>

<seg id="2040">What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?," in cinemas from 11.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a flower-dress and a fitting crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had "about the black experience and the black state" countless times before this morning.</seg>

<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter met with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's figure.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"" "" "" "my activism changed totally after 9 August," "" "she said, noticing that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities." ""</seg>

<seg id="2057">"" "everything has come." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the film's co-directors.</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"" "a question came to Ferrell into the mind:" "" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community which benefited from their pain and their resilience.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, together with six other locals the Whose Streets team followed. "in the years following browser shootings.</seg>

<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrells' experience - to show that the movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrara's life, as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>

<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferrells' history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayby Martin in 2012 marked the film "Blacklive Matter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," Ferrell said, "and we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>

<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves the people, although it has not been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian area splits the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The subject hardly leaves the subject cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one to the bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be real great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "no man" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While supporters rely on the fact that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, from which the other shops are benefiting, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of the construction work, it will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda place with the possibility to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2107">Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think this is superfluous.</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are plenty of them in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shop shops here are empty - some have been around for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see shops are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">It's a pity that there are almost no special shops and what is left of it will probably disappear. "</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">First of all: where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming.</seg>

<seg id="2122">But for a farmer's market hall there is no place thanks to the crazy many - as I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg no more.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible, hanging from the ceiling on cables.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after having publicly posted diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (a matching similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg whose discipline unified her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg developed the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, a sharp, although somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations, but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits comfortably on a driver's seat and carries a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a sort of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA-portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her detained Muse have become unequal partners who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a comic "soup magazine," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the president should convert chelated judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, requiring Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid mindsets that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning signed an end to the "automatic fragmentation," which has been the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a jack-of-all of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide based on the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), how surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning, as she appears with a hands-on phone in the hand from the disciplinary brains of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"" "" "" "if they tell your words, then they have won," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2151">"" "" "" "so don't stop your mouth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greeted me from Philadelphia.</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacles, which gather together like hordes of protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2155">This was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition, up to the size (5 "2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagbork from the portraits.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not mourn the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside to help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of human resources start-ups is at growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, staff anonymity and complaint management hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Redwood City start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said they had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low approval outcomes - so that you can reboot, why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you won't be the next Uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken are punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups like GLINT this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance sector could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps businesses prevent and recognize bad behaviour, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-Falles in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Cent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent companies send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline, with which employees can report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the public opinion condemns the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites, has used Convercent for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company uses Convercent, problems that have previously been hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed faster, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practice.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of employment experience," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>

<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"" "" "" "before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent provide your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance that takes the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both startups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Scent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with the total capital raised to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">He secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and donated his entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the networked nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only deployments.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "if people are happy to be in a company that is theirs, and that the work that you do is worthwhile, then they feel stronger to make this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience with LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and GLINT." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve yields when their portfolio companies are running well. businesses run well when employees are committed and engaged.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts in the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come fast enough, or not at all, this can produce disappointment and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you are wondering about 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management firm of Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too heavily on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you don't follow fellow workers," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now carries out monthly employee surveys, was able to take action on the same day if a problem is reported about GLINT, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after the gathering of feedback from frustrated employees, it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday, the company is gaining new insights into the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better bondage of workers in an industry that is known for high turnover.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose the people," said Vitrano.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.</seg>
<seg id="2258">And if you lose your customers, you will lose business.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a cosmhaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents.</seg>

<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story has been illustrated by another British artist, Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: in 2014 he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s who worked for the Jacobins, "he says.</seg>

<seg id="2299">And letters always smell like smoke; for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>

<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome pit") it all seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape painters, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and started writing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks just started to take care of the archive that he described as "hundreds of years," in which aristocrats said, "Oh, cast it on the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, maps depicting what possessed something: "you might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">"" "guys, let everything go their way!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a rebellion which occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book with the title 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was depicted in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney: "gentlemen seemed to be quite a gauntlet, always pay debts and spend money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-males solder their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent to advertise landins. "</seg>

<seg id="2358">Three times they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan was pushing the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2373">Ministry wants to refurbish track for airport shuttle</seg>
<seg id="2374">Again and again over the past few months have been contested about the future of racing shuttles - now it is supposed to be quite fast.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Before the end of the year, it is supposed to be built on the dilapidated route on which the tourist train departs.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In order to secure the future of the racing shuttles in the long term, construction work is to begin on the route according to the Ministry of Transport this year.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"with the decision to further order and rehabilitate the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig, the country acknowledges its commitment to tourism," declared the Minister for Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of the sex robot is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them, and we will see them much more often," said Mr Sharkey in the publication of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "adapt" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes more disturbing as many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "that would make a stepford woman progressively look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxi Gold Sex-Robot, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah, which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"" "" "" "Roxxxy gold has a personality that suits your personality as best as possible," "" "enthuses the website of True Companion." ""</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robots - last but not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the subservient feminine features, the allusions to rape, when you move a step towards Frigid (here: resisting) Farrah, troubled one most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website, True Companion Roxxxylated with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply a different sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Its emergence and its increasing sophistication point to something Dunkleres and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men will of course not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what is seeping out of the edge-zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots show up at a time when the rights of women worldwide are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House who has sprayed to have women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most dreadful aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the poke eyes, but how realistic this vision appears.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background story, nothing that interprets independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the expression of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Slingbacks Large performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truism of the Trump-era that political divisions, which have polarized the US voters, also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all pretending to blow up our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-facing poet who lives in Chicago and has long occupied himself with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone who knows them, including the Republican kinship, with which they fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">For the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it is in another context that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalization" and drunkers, we refer to the spooky possibility that his kittens of one day will no longer be ejected.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republican of the Right wing "normalizes" that suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness compared to its standards.</seg>
<seg id="2437">I find myself today by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's uric version of the decline - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked out) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild crime.</seg>
<seg id="2438">If Trump is going, the next candidate of the Republican only needs to be mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York parking department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knurry and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate-perming music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience, as here are two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in the 40-seventies and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week I was forced into a department store to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation that is not required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was excused, while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius with chest pain transferred from prison to hospital</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a visit to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, due to the treatment of cuts, he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts. according to the prison authorities, he suffered a fall in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013, when he shot them several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his house in Pretoria on her.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius asserted that he kept his girlfriend for a nocturnal intruder, hiding in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say that it is too lenient.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Law Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the acquittal could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslach's Stadtbaumeister, will retire next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The position is already written - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been the City Engineer since 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work is still great fun for him, as he mediates in the press briefing.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports on diverse, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that so far no application has fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">So - taking into account the regular periods of notice - there is still enough time for a revision.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administrative community as a subcontractor, the applicant has to present relevant conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it would not be able to fill them out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But citizens' closeness is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate as well as good spirits between the authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2550">The bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and stadium renovation is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "" "" "all in all, great tasks await my successor." ""</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">In terms of design, there is a great scope for a city architect.</seg>
<seg id="2555">With Haslach's own building yard and gardening you can react flexibly to many things.</seg>
<seg id="2556">"" "" "" "you can move a lot," "" "says Wacker, and the design of green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors." ""</seg>
<seg id="2557">As the oldtown is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to "have an eye on what is in tune with," if new buildings are approved, the outgoing Stadtbaumeister emphasizes.</seg>
<seg id="2558">The Stadtbaumeister is already responsible for this.</seg>
<seg id="2559">"" "he is the client," "" "in the end everything runs on my table." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2560">In the event of supervision and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schoer (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">Wacker wants his successor to stay for a long time: "we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place."</seg>
<seg id="2562">This is because continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Anyone who wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should have completed a completed degree in the city of Haslach as a graduate engineer or a Bachelor's degree in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of planning and building planning.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Municipal Building Authority is subject to civil and civil engineering, building management planning, mining matters, administration of municipal property, urban depot with building yard and landscaping, as well as underground construction rights authority including monument protection.</seg>

<seg id="2575">Nearly ten people had dropped out Friday afternoon, two of them were in correspondence.</seg>
<seg id="2576">Freight trains did not fall out, but they delayed.</seg>
<seg id="2577">According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims the exact opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable condition affecting approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan by proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The senior researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells patrol in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food are not penetrated into the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that can trigger inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cell occurs in mice carrying a certain bacterium in its initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had of these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. repteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote a more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral student Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was but separated, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiome of the mice had to be done - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of mice were sequenced and there were found six bacterial species that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. repteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers made L. repteri grow in a liquid and then led small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as the Indol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but if tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that humans have the same intolerance-promoting cells, such as mice, and that most of us protect L. crossteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said:" "" "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines." ""</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an extension of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2677">In the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>

<seg id="2687">The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and developing the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out object-related, i.e. per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The redevelopment area would then be defined as a constitution.</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December as far as possible the statute decision should be made, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each commune must carry out the said preventive examinations.</seg>

<seg id="2715">The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers according to the military specification given to the TIME Magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited beside a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin firefighter and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order or Frago, barely thirty hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the helicopter Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, deputy commander of the naval aviation command.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The news showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning on the South Lawn for the event at 15: 00, and so long it was until the turf was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 that night.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the confinement of the hours of service.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground on the aircraft during the time.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required.</seg>

<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budget labels for the presidential oughs, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.</seg>

<seg id="2745">Records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "setting the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion.</seg>

<seg id="2849">A union wants to make sure that the long-term commitment to production in Glasgow's factory in Glasgow is assured by McVitie's managers.</seg>
<seg id="2850">GMB Scotland said that the company has kept silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross location.</seg>
<seg id="2851">More than 500 employees work at the plant, which, in addition to other products, produces hobnobs and rich tea biscuits.</seg>
<seg id="2852">McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="2855">GMB-Senior-Organizer Drew Duffy, said: "the fact that we are unable to gain clarity about our business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is deeply affected by our members.</seg>
<seg id="2856">Generations of families have worked here, and the labour forces are strongly focused on the local community and Glasgow's large space, an important pillar of decent employment in a field of high unemployment and social disadvantage.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Hence, under the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of the Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline of production, the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently a florizing production presence at McVitie. "</seg>

<seg id="2863">Did the PSG Barcelona warn of Neymar three years ago?</seg>
<seg id="2864">The page of La Liga may be of interest to Marco Verratti</seg>
<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain won't leave Neymar in pursuit of a £189 million offer to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record attack?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has sparked the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>
<seg id="2868">Barcelona is mad about the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="2869">But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President before this prospect?</seg>
<seg id="2870">When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a severe warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.</seg>
<seg id="2871">"I'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players, we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," said Al-Khelaifi.</seg>

<seg id="2873">"" "but if they try to let one of our players sign up, this will have consequences." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2874">Barcelona seems to have crossed this line, where the Spanish club expressed interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer.</seg>
<seg id="2875">PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.</seg>
<seg id="2876">Scooters Reed and Damaged</seg>

<seg id="2879">The police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2880">Because he met a car in his lane, the driver had to evade a VW Touran and toured the crash guard.</seg>
<seg id="2881">On Thursday evening the 34 year old came from Rehburg-Loccum with his VW at 7.55 a.m. on the B 215 from Stolzenau towards Leese.</seg>
<seg id="2882">In the area of the outskirts of Stolzenau, a passenger car came to meet him in his lane so that he had to escape to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2883">In doing so, the Touran rider toured the guard rails.</seg>
<seg id="2884">The car was damaged by material damage.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The driver of the opposite passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.</seg>
<seg id="2886">According to the accident victims it may be good that the Mercedesier had not noticed the accident at all.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann writes.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche," declared after publication against the German press agency, he expected from former Regensburg bishop and present-day cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deepest regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "on the other hand, the Vatican newspaper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "criticises that" "" "double standards" "" "are measured in reporting on violence in the Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">Regarding the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts," which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scaraffia, Historian and Member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of the everyday experience and prepares the public opinion to keep it normal," "" "he writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bavarian Radio:" "" "we like going to the church and that's a fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "furthermore, she pointed out that" "" "blows were a normal educational means" "" "in her youth," "" "to be done with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards for past decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the abuse, pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Author and historian Michael Hesemann, who authored the "My brother of the Pope" with Ratzinger, writes completely wrongly, translated into 12 languages.</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection," "" "says Hesemann," "" "for all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is written in the 440-page report, which the lawyer Ulrich Weber submitted to the Enlightenment asked by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">Between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen became victims of overprint, 67 domain sparrows sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report, Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that in many cases the masters of Domkapellmeister were used to form forms of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">However, in contrast to many other accusations, many victims estimate that many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen station Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence Exercises on Protection Quarterly at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "is a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a cathedral kit didn't bring a top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyse this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the effort and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears in it at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the excesses in the pre-school expropriated itself outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">At best it is possible to reproach him, to experience it too late or not to have taken first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as "Redemption," "heaven" and "better world" by virtually all respondents.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students George Ratzinger also provides an excellent certificate, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "intelligible," as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the guys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and was "always surrounded by children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to breakdowns.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he did not only bang with chairs and cast the key ring on the floor, but also dealt face slap and twisted too cheeky guys at the hair or ears, he himself admitted even years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">It must be said, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the period between the 1960s and 1970s, with parents and teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what it is all about in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, these are Bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not related to his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media has just rushed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him at the Bavarian pope are still working diligently.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report releases Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, there has been a lot of reports on abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also involved in any involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk about it with my father or mother," "" "said an saddest representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing to me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in the clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims of shame remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a chorus who professionally had been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger's role with regard to the abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "concerning sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that... Buben have more intrusive or clear or even more open than their parents, dormitory leaders, trust teachers etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">Talking to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "so the report concludes with a clear conclusion:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him could not be confirmed as part of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is thus acquitted of every acquaintance.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented or brought him to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these disgusting crimes, as happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "there was a lot of" "" "violent excesses" "" "in the media at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of being" "" "looking down" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem, that in reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violent excesses as well as, we say, other reproaches.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which the boys of sadistic teachers were properly harassed and portrayed, and suffered terribly, were all acquired at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there were really scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with them Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys face only when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, as most witnesses stressed, the theme of "primary school" was taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">"" "you were only happy to escape and enjoy the much better treatment and for many even" "" "paradisiac" "" "states." ""</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was a lot of discipline, but no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even associate positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the reproach still remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in the year 1970 / 71, when he had just started to establish himself and of the events at a school in which he was not working and responsible, (as the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then only back in 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger stick to the ears consistently in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "in the pre-school, the punishment will continue to be practiced" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In the face of the danger of negative press release, he recommended urgent action.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, as testing punishments were also banned in Bavaria for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that they occurred in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he has always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the examination of schools in Bavaria was officially abolished.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the "trap of anachronism," so the danger of judging the past of today's moral standards.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this, of course, does not apply to sexual abuse that has been abhorred at all times and not for what has been smashed in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the then practice of that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very awful and I am glad that it will finally be reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means for disciplining and punishment, i.e. to draw ear-files and to the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970ies.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was forbidden, he kept strictly adhering to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "which picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter of Prüfer also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI said, from his perspective, as the domains played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not hide in any way that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said once: without this perfectionism, without demanding unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone you don't even make a big singer and stand in front of every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced over and over again as a wonderful, humorous, deep-minded, deeply believer and heart-loving person, from which one can not imagine that he could only do something for a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with him, like many former domites, 23 years after his emeritation, regularly contact him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who did not forgive him until now, that he was once strict with them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most domain sparrows are grateful to him today for having enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, patriarchal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respectful person to which they still look up today and which they almost revere.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once more clearly: all that is accrued to him are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent that is behind it all too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The report, which has just been published, relieves the burden on him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the stand-up, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany's probably nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
