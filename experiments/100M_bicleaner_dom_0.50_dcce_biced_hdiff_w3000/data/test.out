28 @-@ year @-@ old Koch found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who was recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stair@@ way of a local shopping mall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ pse found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the Judi@@ cial Department in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigation was running .
the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , shared his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him sore , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are at this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived in host@@ els first , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things finally went uphill for him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
to connect with his family was to always cook us a bit to prepare dinner , &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia .
he never wanted to participate in any kind of discussion .
he was the brother who swa@@ m with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining bri@@ ghtly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case will be asked to call the H@@ PD of the SF@@ D under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston hasn &apos;t always had to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has made this an un@@ equi@@ vocal statement in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always plu@@ gged into drawers or stuck on labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are more sn@@ app@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of a television with a delicious de@@ bris and Mexican food , in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white glu@@ t , they bring the question of children &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play , &quot; Ani@@ ston is a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger Rec@@ ei@@ ves the World Py@@ ramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a bit of change with a ride on the beach with some colleagues .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed @-@ consoles .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and that ended the equ@@ est@@ rian career again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer from all times - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses .
he let himself be led with his family through the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even swear for photographic purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sporting aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen , within the framework of a small gala , the Golden sports pyramid .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ lau@@ rel , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ...
even the British Queen had already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long .
in Aachen , on Saturday he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting the offspring .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the performers include the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the former Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Bob @-@ driver Mein@@ hard N@@ eh@@ mer , der Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the show jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza price was running .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Bran@@ ch Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
to invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are not one in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are fundamentally under@@ pinn@@ ed by a more philosophical difference .
that , over the role of the state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will drive heavily back on regulations , and he is power@@ ing up a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances to open up and needs money for it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes would increase for the rich , she says .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton are almost wor@@ rying .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there might be partial discussions about dr@@ um@@ ming .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and restore coal mining in the United States .
oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas , it wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment program and asks : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even when it comes to international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the Tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ lian trade agreement , do not want to sign .
at the same time , however , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - it simply wants to better protect American jobs .
they should then be paid better , for example , calls for Clinton .
the present minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the minimum wage has to be r@@ ushed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says , he must not be changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics follow him , so that the budget deficit could only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton is at least asking the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the tabl@@ et@@ op .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the business director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social welfare services in Bavaria and deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are P@@ oultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid Association .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee for wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope for hope , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women , other reasons out@@ weigh the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the run , that goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , for example , demand sexual action for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end , as soon as they are in Germany , is mistaken , tells B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and at worst mis@@ used .
this means that around 90 per cent of women who live in the north of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ sed , she appreci@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they dare not speak openly about what we experienced , because the shame is too great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often do not know how to help , more accommodations need only for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
some with no reply to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction .
in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the accommodation of governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fle@@ eting women are not accommod@@ ated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , the government spokes@@ man .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are floors in some common shel@@ ters or houses for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are har@@ n@@ essed separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lack of privacy , or if men and women are accommod@@ ated , there can be - continual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the study shows that the wash@@ rooms should be separately and easily accessible for women .
how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the crowds who are waiting for the house in Munich .
&quot; since we &apos;ve talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; says B@@ ahr .
you could easily set up a second house .
assistant doctors strike : demands for new labour campaig@@ ning measures
representatives of the Assistant Doc@@ tors have called on their union to appro@@ ve new labour campaig@@ ning measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour campaig@@ ning measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC stated that there would have been ministers to address the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
it was rejected by 58 % of its members voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had remained &quot; stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly quiet , &quot; which led to the refusal of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In light of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Committee today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running programme of escal@@ ating labour combat measures beginning in September .
the disputes led to the fact that Assistant Doc@@ tors struck six times this year , the first complete failures in the history of the N@@ HS .
the director of the BM@@ A resident doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that were still held before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted .
after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced compulsory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; out@@ sider &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey came on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny that Ankara would like this reconciliation the most .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile appeared sli@@ pper@@ y and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand , Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything bad .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was arous@@ ed .
Putin condemned and accused Ankara of having fallen behind Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
building up the c@@ ous@@ ins will be difficult , if not impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , state @-@ controlled media led a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
most serious were the alle@@ gations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
after all , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan that he wanted to hear .
Russia could make a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan first needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of almost his ministry last month in a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terrorist attacks against Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
this week , the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ Dem@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry at the West as it looks at the reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to this end , the continued gru@@ dge about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit at this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described to me : two countries that feel threatened and treated badly by the West and now unite .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role of peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents said at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even touched the subject .
the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress them .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired up the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are talking at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland is no longer available for customers outside of Scotland
according to the Board of Directors , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available for customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan announced the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was associated with the global ambi@@ tions of the bank .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now she has decided to focus more on national stamps .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , decentr@@ alized head@@ quarter and stock exchange are transferred to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for the private client business which will get more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees , Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand of RS@@ B will become our investor brand and the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am saying now that we do not pursue global objectives but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work with the customers among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer afford its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus internally ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the CEO .
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and that these brands have been launched .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these marks again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches his 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit on Friday at New@@ market .
he sat on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local circuit with his second win of the night a milestone .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the triple winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who was in front of G@@ ha@@ yy@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes up the rejo@@ icing when he wins victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career prospects
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey nations of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it &apos;s his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma have been enthusiastic fans for this sport for years .
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6,000 gains if he was not just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden in GB for almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fi@@ gu@@ re@@ head of Britain &apos;s flat racing for over two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he initially encountered difficulties when he returned from his six month lock@@ out , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ter and return to his best form .
and he &apos;s not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori earlier said that he wants to continue in competitions up to the age of at least 50 years .
Russia &apos;s Putin firing Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V has been part of the closest council of confidence for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transportation matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without giving reasons , Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his deputy since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy .
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it reads ( in Russian ) that he later was Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the staff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov was asked to leave his post and recommend V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has mysteri@@ ously inter@@ tw@@ ined Moscow .
Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ dant , working as he did for the Soviet Intelligence Service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , which was broadcast on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will res@@ ign at their own request .
but despite the ridi@@ cul@@ ing for the cameras , few are convinced here - especially now , shortly before the parliamentary elections .
is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
but the official claim - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president who once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - reached great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - plac@@ able posts for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as Putin , a former member of the K@@ GB State Security Service .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin came to power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted most .
once it was assumed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of office had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another nearby ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son participated last month in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced in a joint statement its termination .
Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination .
on the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the character Gib@@ son out of the series that follows a team of FBI agents is expected to be published according to the opinion of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios at a later date .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was part of the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but this will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series .
the planned broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale might act , that were sp@@ elled by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the vi@@ a@@ duct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four clos@@ ings to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 incl@@ ine cords .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
economic Minister Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to cross the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when you build Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit .
overall , almost 79 % of the deck &apos;s decks lie in their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first closure presents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of the future @-@ oriented high @-@ rise and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the North tower , we had to close the gap on the north or the north .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 mil@@ lim@@ eter south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , since the Vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs approx . 6000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % .
uncle , because the toler@@ ances on which the team worked were tiny - on each side they were only a few milli@@ meters .
fortunately , everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after being thrown off fishing boats in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at rang at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw the boat cir@@ cling around her and presented us the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the rescue station at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds ble@@ w the boat out of its range until we let go of water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coast @-@ rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but the boat was released by the person who controlled the boat .
someone watches over these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police announced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
instead , the mi@@ st@@ on@@ ized offen@@ ders cut off his ex girlfriend &apos;s clothes .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice to her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was hurt by the hand and on the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend &apos;s clothes , he called his mother .
she then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street , they met the husband &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex girlfriend .
who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens are saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors should be taken much more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; action concept for housing &quot; at the next council session .
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first of all , the question is : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation has been lacking so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : if you want to build on urban areas , in future we will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable housing can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new urban housing development program that will cost millions of dollars and is still to be financed is to provide incentives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions right now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make as few rules as possible for investors .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
despite this , viol@@ ently viol@@ ently , a tigh@@ tening of the situation in the housing market is emerging .
if the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you balance the loss of more than 1,@@ 300 inexpensive apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the next few years ?
by 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm , prospective bonds should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought of buying apartments back into the price bond .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke , the problem could be solved .
at the end of the year , Fri@@ sten will be running in the West@@ stadt .
around 1800 apartments could be found there back to the price relationship for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations .
because the number of social housing in the west is dramatically increased , the aim of the so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ ness is removed .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged neighbour@@ hoods in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that no compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
teenagers and children will no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their free time star@@ ing on screens , has been depl@@ eted by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
at first , the time on the screen was limited to the TV , then on video games and recently on smartphones .
so it &apos;s great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest in the release of the game decreased in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ bur@@ dened the servers .
within a few days , Pok@@ emon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ mon , which are followed by a GPS , and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tur@@ key and jumped up for the search of the sofa .
in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in incre@@ ments that the average person re@@ covers every day .
Cardi@@ ff , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people , who train every day for 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people that look miserable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits , which is too long to guide them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friends on the hunt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as always , there are also gr@@ ump@@ y play@@ backs , which always have to complain about something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and yes , someone could run against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit earlier could track our activity , they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will dimin@@ ish over time .
however , based on poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world , helping many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
stun@@ n@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant on the whole line .
and now also the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast clin@@ ched the title of the competition on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and Final Five team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alist Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
the American woman Sim@@ one Bil@@ es performs on the Swedish bar during the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the art gymnas@@ tics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and overall the fifth while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment .
this success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world champi@@ ons - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she expected her last trial in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday ,
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of retired man @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clam@@ ation mark .
although Bil@@ o insi@@ sted on having never planned the future during its long journey , this is not really true .
part of their soil exercises - including their typical tum@@ bling - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man exercised , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as Bil@@ es wishes .
even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina made easy walking through two turns , the picture was clou@@ ded .
balance beams and floor gymnas@@ tics - in which Bil@@ o holds the world title - was listening .
she resum@@ ed her work with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the balance beam and sat on the floor with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently when she expected her grand@@ son - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured into gle@@ e gle@@ aming red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision that she once described in her journal .
the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal was in a ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , named &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after their soil exercise , she threw down kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as far as Bil@@ es is concerned , the rapidly spreading twe@@ ets of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old have a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks of Phoenix for a decade , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stef@@ an@@ ie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis subsidiary Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities .
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fired fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled to another vehicle to read in the report .
the police said that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , who were in possession of one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks , and two others were wounded within four months .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , announced at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the suspect used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincoln .
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which dra@@ gged on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ times murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge cases and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it gets better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his anti@@ qui@@ ties , Ed@@ mund introduces Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself go .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course , you &apos;ve got involved in it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up to the age of his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle lanes .
he also loves playing and singing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund asked for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please remember something &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented several signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infection with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ ka@@ virus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and pre@@ dictions may vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of infected with the Zi@@ ka@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I was constantly asking what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ ka@@ virus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives cause for ba@@ il@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the Gover@@ nor to call on the emergency room on Friday .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi over@@ flooded their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards alle@@ ges that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , told us that the requests for flood @-@ vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested tens of thousands of sand bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ites near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will probably reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a flow @-@ downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as via the tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 , which was ever recorded .
rescue teams still plu@@ cked people out of flood water in the bor@@ ough Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , increased overnight .
he said he had warned him of another son who lives nearby .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and f@@ lowed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife Hans@@ ford said she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim .
Hans@@ ford said that No@@ thel@@ fer escaped all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were station@@ ed until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer contacted Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a subsidiary in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which were now flooded .
the ruler of the community of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the ev@@ ac@@ uation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , nearly two dozen roads were closed because of the flood and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part , which hope to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration .
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as floo@@ ding , but on Friday they have not been reported .
Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager of Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia
the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries including in the end , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital with his transport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he did a lot , his little body was punc@@ tured by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z shared with the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I just can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the TV station that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police found out whether one of the injured men could find the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge shells for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which have been traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , s@@ nat@@ ched the crime scene .
it seems that this is clearly a prolonged struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were sleeves .
it seems that there have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony G@@ inal@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter .
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ port@@ edly veri@@ fying the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a cross beam when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane .
it catches up and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
this is what I imagine taking part in the Women &apos;s Olympi@@ ad in gymnas@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been part of every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three gym@@ na@@ sts , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin colors .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied black and his@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one female female gym@@ n@@ ast was an Af@@ ro @-@ American woman .
last year were Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ a@@ winner and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected , yet master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ ex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the peak of this kind of sport , but it does not look like gymnas@@ tics across the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four female gym@@ na@@ sts in the team .
but the reality is that gymnas@@ tics is a costly sport and Tur@@ ner primarily comes into private sports clubs which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . the list can be continued arbitr@@ arily .
the majority of these gymnas@@ tics lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support business .
in these clubs the Tur@@ ner will get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started with gymnas@@ tics .
we have to draw the communities out of inn@@ um@@ erable , young girls , inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a more affordable and easily accessible gymnas@@ tics training .
I founded my turn@@ around 20 years ago .
at my events , we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ ns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and his@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport and to profit .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health and scho@@ oling and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team , bringing thousands of young girls interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team square and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 37@@ ,000 assistant doctors voted in favour of a vote rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the Treaty by way of compul@@ sion and said that the N@@ HS found itself in a &quot; No Man Land &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful .
the first assistance physicians will receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the maintenance of un@@ scheduled watch@@ making .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , Chairman of the BM@@ A Committee on Assistance , announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance physicians have still raised serious concerns about the proposed deal , in particular that it will fuel the current financial crisis and will meet all physicians . &quot;
in only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time will exp@@ ire .
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve the dispute by dialogue caused the government to participate in opposition and sometimes on a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this was done by a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had just made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance physicians . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do this , the Assistant Doc@@ tors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the Strei@@ k@@ post chain cover .
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the Re@@ formed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ day pay for the 5@@ 4.000 Assistance Physi@@ cians subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS employees , called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; working conditions achieve nothing that only little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for the patients , nursing staff and their families only worries , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we have spoken to the Committee of Assistance Physi@@ cians and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries with regard to guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lowing .
the employers hope that continuing positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and gender @-@ specific wage differential in medicine - were a sign of how serious it were the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BM@@ A agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 per day medicine that can lower heart attack risk
thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority , N@@ ICE , recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
N@@ ICE &apos;s regulatory authority , N@@ ICE , recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke .
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that stops the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dissolve , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely .
N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack suffer from a heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this .
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture makes electoral fraud flour@@ ish in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities ignor@@ antly ignor@@ ing a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of election abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , now an anti @-@ corruption regime , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut @-@ off bands outside electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he recommends that voters should consult with them to prove their identity in elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a vot@@ er must merely name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply a non @-@ removable ink on the finger of a person if they release their vote to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by un@@ official committees or working groups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a consequence of the Tower Ham@@ lets Choice Channel in the east of London .
last year , a special court ruled that the inc@@ umbent mayor , Lut@@ on Rah@@ man , should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let his campaign be on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses to be someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence for fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm about the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - when the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , shown , made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system , including conducting expressions to prove identity
in his report it states : &quot; as evidence , it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exer@@ ted , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the older , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensi@@ tivities concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition that political activists work let@@ ter@@ dial documents to stop &quot; election harv@@ ests . &quot;
the report commissioned by Ther@@ esa May also requires harder registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social security purposes .
options consider to ask voters before choosing your identification .
un@@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger use as soon as she has released her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
to conduct systematic reviews on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic brief@@ ing .
prohibition that political activists process complete letters of letters and envel@@ opes of letters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have the authority to set up lock@@ ings for election stations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a change in legislation facilit@@ ating an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act ( 1983 ) .
prohibition of photograph@@ ing in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go alone to the electoral cab .
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that the Tower Ham@@ lets didn &apos;t show a complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Elec@@ toral Court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on a number of reasons , in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ out checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the electoral registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court martial in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country is a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threat@@ ens this good reputation .
crazy to Kate &apos;s Rad@@ ler Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot , who has proved to be an impressive double successor of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only athlete to have gold fighting Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous doppel@@ gan@@ ger - at least not when one can believe the social media belief .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from Kate &apos;s double assistant on the racing track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain arch of the twin from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he sees the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily similar .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good @-@ looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the highlight of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast , Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina , with her large , expressive eyes , is supposed to be able to go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer David Van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one course higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Schauspiel@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot;
another lasting comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal s@@ wimm@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mo@@ a shows more than just the sun@@ tan skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a t@@ witter @-@ user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
a t@@ witter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US So@@ ccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and face .
other popular compar@@ isons include Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner at Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his testimony that Chinese swi@@ mmer died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer died as &quot; down &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone switched off when he passed his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m conserv@@ atory squ@@ ad@@ ron .
Mac@@ Donald , who was taken on board in the commentary booth of the C@@ BS , to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
too excited , went down like low , died like a pig .
thank you for that .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , swa@@ m the second stage of the swimming staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
spectators across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Em@@ manuel Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not realize that they were still on air . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai Yan@@ han from China has been described as follows at the final 4 x 200m outdoor swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
the criticism against By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter was fast and hard , with which many spoke to him
Twitter users did not think back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another t@@ witter user wrote Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists . # attached .
a short time later Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the commentary being broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for 90 times to the people responding to the Noti@@ ce on Twitter
comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements have been made and that it has been made possible for them to be broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on the show and our fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person .
yet they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wor@@ ding . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympic plot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
purch@@ aser in Pri@@ mark is ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tries under@@ wear in the shop
the buyers did not know where to look when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a mar@@ row to try bot@@ toms .
in order to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she dra@@ gged her out and put them back on the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark store at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman pro@@ bed the under@@ pants before putting them back on the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she reg@@ ained herself and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the selling area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled her own pants and pants and tried them .
&quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a more dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like Osk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , attracted attention again and went out .
&quot; she didn &apos;t seem to dis@@ rupt anybody watching - or thinking about the person who would possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting it is that someone would take pants with him who had another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to draw the clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and didn &apos;t wash them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Pri@@ mark said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

how to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com might make it a bit safer for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar around for your rob@@ ber .
when you get closer to you from behind , then you should turn around as first so you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the line , &quot; Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi says .
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
strike him with his knee in the l@@ ath and twist , while the aggres@@ sor gets clas@@ ped from pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while throwing the weapon on him .
for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can not shoot .
at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
but remember that it is the saf@@ est way to hand over your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master .
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller underwent a serious examination by a British trav@@ eller , by le@@ aning on some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k ab@@ ated his train on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before le@@ aking every object he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved .
but the experiment , which was filmed in the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results .
the thought to lick up the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a pull toilet used by thousands of others may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately , nothing left him , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public rail@@ roads to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task turned out to be a sample of his immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , soil , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test swa@@ b showed a lumin@@ ous number of more than 4000 units .
compared to that , the lumin@@ ous number of fresh washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ous number was over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places , such as the bathroom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve sm@@ elled in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I won &apos;t want to lick here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vali@@ os senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we w@@ aged crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming , who ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of just talking about the products , we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I ordered him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we &apos;ve recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that at least they occasionally use products containing included lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ soci@@ etal Coh@@ en Dest@@ ro@@ yed Del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing Social Home in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left its housing after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation of £ 50,000 , because it had terr@@ orized its neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ vis@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition .
the walls showed g@@ aping holes , wood boards were torn , garbage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that they are now living in a private accomodation .
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in that way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , because this property is thought to be not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive shou@@ ting , strings and floods .
Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , received an arrangement for anti@@ social behaviour in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up
neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and had to be called regularly to the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ gi@@ erte her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family would have had to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years .
tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down on the over@@ grown side of the church building .
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant would refuse to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as a del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing is always the last step into consideration Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information .
I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ zing on the floor .
workers of the house administration will have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don was fin@@ ed a fine after having found himself guilty of own@@ ing a class B drug in trade visibility .
she claimed that the money was a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they will deleg@@ ate rent@@ ers who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with the fact that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not comply with the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can act without repro@@ aches , as well as those who were har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless military jet over@@ flies beach
sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane of the Air Force gar@@ ner@@ ed an incredible flight
the Air Force stated that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk
this was the moment in which frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after an eff@@ or@@ tless jet crashes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew near the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal almost in a pal@@ p@@ able proximity .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos on the dramatic fly @-@ by in the social media , said : &quot; it really flew very low twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the airplane crashed on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro have been panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify f@@ isher boats off the coast and flying so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that due to the bad visibility of the area around the area , the jet flew somewhat deeper than usual , but the air forces insi@@ sted that the security at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland during this summer , where four people died in the island Madeira .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and smoke , which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise .

coach Luis En@@ rique &apos;s refra@@ ined from making a clear decision so far , leaving Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen leads the way in most of the rest of the applicants .
before the first mandatory game of the new season , the Spanish master doubts about the fitness level of the team who was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ men@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday , Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. really didn &apos;t really convince .

with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in its own league of table tennis @-@ gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
on Thursday the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and title defender Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .

bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ zu@@ ani .
the two Chinese did it as expected and made the title with each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would pick up the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
the last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the plate , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn into the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the matches to this place have been played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had said rightly .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight only in the first set with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent .
then he set the pace at the top and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the unexpected gri@@ pping match .

Donald Tr@@ ump sums up &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now has weaknesses in his election campaign in the former repub@@ li@@ can strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the normally large @-@ gauge and self @-@ assured mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed such concern as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own Republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians who asked him for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the blame is false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
shaking Republi@@ can strongh@@ olds
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
according to a survey conducted by Surv@@ ey@@ enne in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were al@@ ig@@ ning .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common for repub@@ li@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are also endangered .
in an interview by the radio station CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as to how he wanted to stop Clin@@ tons &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and whether afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he doesn &apos;t do anything else than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is not enough for him at the end for political correctness , that is fine , Tr@@ ump said .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party should have threatened to cut funds to support his campaign , he should not be able to present any better results .
instead of taking the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans for Congress , one wants to take a stronger grip on the arms .
Olympia : three sc@@ am on the dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach at home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately set up a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told us that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had a urine test in the Olympic village under the name of the 800 meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red .
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing control agencies .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the follow @-@ up measures taken by the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and retired as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red , who submitted and signed the test , &quot; said Ken@@ y@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete , who was on the list for training controls of the world @-@ anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports he is said to have been arrested on his return at the airport of Nairobi .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing activities , Kenya has been under special surveillance for some time now .
during the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls imposed by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympic Games begin .
in consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya took on the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA .
Kenya is regarded as a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired them in Russian athle@@ tics .
it was demonstrated that this type of sport was systematically ged@@ and systematically .
Russia &apos;s athletes were expelled from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival is presenting the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , like Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s masterpiece .
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled the role of Maria a youth space .
in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var orchestra is under the bat@@ on of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin @-@ American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we have Bernstein &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members Tony with melanch@@ oly , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character whom I have as Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an immen@@ sely generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in every one of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them .
they are the same topics and they are as meaningful today as it was then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girl who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria a few weeks ago .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the bul@@ war@@ k of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she preten@@ ded to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing lies in it - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making that decision , &quot; Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school girls from the east of London boar@@ ded a plane in the direction of Turkey and then embark@@ ed on a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family has been informed that she has married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and has become a widow within a few months .

the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck magazine differs from classic school play@@ boys because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the view that it does the Calendar also .
&quot; we have to return to the representation of timeless and classical nude , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release on the publication of the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community counts on mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you don &apos;t fit and praise Erdo@@ gan , sit on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dialog und Welt &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of protective search@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it might even be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh advance of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan following the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands of refugees in Germany in the medium term , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; World &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the government has already with@@ drew Kurdish strongh@@ olds with sanctions five months ago , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the vain coup , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state who takes up refugees himself produces refugees in their own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the association compla@@ ined about the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Ala@@ wit@@ e cities .
that is why Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or driven out in the past hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Prime Minister demanded that the Federal Government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , mainly Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len Pend@@ ant destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; those who don &apos;t fit and praise Erdo@@ gan are seated on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and H@@ alls , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as reported by the German Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks warned against the coup the largest group of asylum seekers recognised by political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus just under 29 percent of all recognized as a candidate ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there is no escape from war , poverty or lack of perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are strictly political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
in 2021 , the country &apos;s election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ iner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year .
for stupid as far it is not possible : summer holidays , heat and land election campaign - that bites itself .
the locals , who want to be convinced by the campaign fighters , are on vacation .
most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Ru@@ egen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so may not choose the land tag .
there are practical problems : in the holidays hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count on the end votes are difficult to drive up .
until 4 September 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern again has to pass through election campaign to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , Leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ alism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive campaig@@ ning , one sees from his big posters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ases a little with the people , just as he did his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel bears the blame on the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its leading candidate , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time .
she has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary election circle is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary @-@ General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost @-@ CD@@ U largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , according to Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; minor role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union also noted that in the country you are crum@@ bling the basis that it has to be very tough to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are moving like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly there is in the expan@@ ses of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U milit@@ ant Kok@@ ert to his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the S &amp; D Group was at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just in front of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election in 2011 , the SPD had still clearly gained 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they make a modern virtue of holiday hard@@ ship and largely lay their election campaign largely on the Internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the country president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green campaig@@ ners embar@@ k on a search for traces of local voters among holi@@ day@@ makers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even nice .
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished .
for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end up at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are praise everywhere .
&quot; they made everything quite jag@@ ged , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the Jet petrol station .
this is a super team .
there is no delay either .
the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , and everything will be ready by the end of October .
the commen@@ cement of the work of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of residential buildings .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is back , the traffic situation within the place has relaxed .
the citizens can now sail from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the village seems to go back .
&quot; there were sometimes considerable complaints , &quot; says Florian King , responsible for the management of the rehabilitation department of the rehabilitation department .
the residents of Bach@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ strasse , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Sch@@ leich@@ distances searched and more familiar to their navigation device than the sig@@ nage .
what led to some truck drivers fran@@ king in residential areas .
as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality was demanding an increase in the M@@ ös@@ singen test vehicle .
&quot; there were significant transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who informed himself about the situation himself .
there have been two to three per minute .
the fastest was on the way with 77 km / h in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales incub@@ ation with them , everyone you ask is per@@ plex@@ ed .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the deal@@ ership of Ma@@ ier , but also acknow@@ le@@ dges that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mil@@ eage is missing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most powerful are the restaurants along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; &quot; &quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the revenue losses are reduced to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the street renovation has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thrown back &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; its operation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , President Jörg Schmidt insi@@ sted on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties , where so much more generous is handled .
for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure his restaurant will continue to exist .
after all , the family business has been here since 17@@ 15 and refers to the long history .
he can understand that other regular guests are less often looking past due to complicated traffic management .
if you can &apos;t go down , it is also nice somewhere else .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt that his stem cli@@ de returns to the end of the re@@ development work .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner keeps the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
in the name of the fight against terrorism , it is constantly scre@@ wed into laws .
following recent attacks , Home Affairs Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère will now present a thick security package .
but what has to do with terror status with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Rec@@ on@@ eh@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically acceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
other , further points would first be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as Minister of the Interior he was in charge of results and at a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has had a little time to pass before he presents his conclusions for safety in the Republic .
but they are all the more extensive .
some things have already been announced , announced , pointed out , that a new security authority in order to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising as well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , the Ma@@ izi@@ ère launches a second suit for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to pose sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be tough points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CD@@ U husband . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still thinks this for reasonable and does not demand anything that doesn &apos;t have any chance in the coalition partner anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have it : he is planning quick procedures for deport@@ ations and more ways of det@@ ain@@ ing people from deportation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
at d@@ olls for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or throw their papers away deliberately to obsc@@ ure their identity .
some of these are politically and legally sanc@@ tioned .
some work also seems to be un@@ checked and leaves questions to be answered .
and with some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises : what does this really have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , many people were worried about safety in the face of the high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and things that the people were deeply involved let themselves not be excluded even in election campaign times .
the inner security is enormously concentrated in the focus .
first the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elec@@ tive campaigns .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
in the past few days , the two parties were moving high .
only a gar@@ nish dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the resort chiefs also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a return from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to make you new is not sensible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it still has to show itself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could cause quar@@ rels .
but the SPD is currently attempting to benefit from internal security .
&quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting off lightly .
despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
however , it does not run around in all markets .
in the recall action , vor@@ tices are about a term .
Volkswagen launches in the second half of the year as a result of deliveries .
despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to present a plus in spite of its many brands and a number of well @-@ run markets .
but in July , VW , the VW brand , weak@@ ening princip@@ ally in Western Europe and thus once again exposed aggregate sales , such as the company listed in the Da@@ x .
worldwide , the VW brand in July sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars to 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales fell 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in Germany &apos;s home market , deliveries dropped by almost a sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , head of marketing , led the weaker figures from July , above all on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also bur@@ dened a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the gas atmosphere first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
all in all , the princip@@ ally affected brand of the Lower Saxony is already getting off lightly by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is expected .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to present a sales increase from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 90@@ 4 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ating exhaust gas testing with a software .
in Germany alone , VW calls around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting to the workshops .
in the course of re@@ armament , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after the vehicles are converted , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions and engine performance do not deterior@@ ate .
after the change@@ over , the automobile manufacturer offers the customer a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was said on Friday in corporate circles .
the reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now offers its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has completely fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and KBA . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; devi@@ ations from this will not be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has taken on the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion , no degradation is taking place and all type @-@ relevant vehicle values have remained unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in business circles . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the wide @-@ term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen clearly sees the possibility that customers come to a workshop for example half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
in the interest of customers , it is also important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the Ab@@ g@@ ass@@ ment sc@@ andal caused uncertainty about possible warran@@ ties , as it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich austerity measures in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ordinary savers have to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not fear to pay for their harsh pen@@ alties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks spend money over night with the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty .
this fee requires Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund to withdraw from September from private and corporate clients for deposits exceeding 100,000 euros on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100.000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100.000 cost in the future 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has been protecting 40 million euros for some time , which could be lifted from one day to another and that he could not utilize .
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and create 0.4 per cent of the costs , &quot; said the bank manager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lay down for each million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost is now passed on to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle .
to let the cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! , &quot; said the bank officer .
most customers would have understood and changed to other types of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry you alone is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not economically feasible &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or money transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 made head@@ lines with penalty interest for deposits amoun@@ ting to three million euros .
Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive of the banking union , said : &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay nationwide fees for deposits , so the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a clientele that is furnished with wealth a little more opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can be a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if they keep money for free . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , sports@@ men and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is currently no further banks known to calculate a compensation for private clients &quot; deposits , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ atives compared to private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not be satisfied in the width .

it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact : older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and stu@@ ffed up before I stop , hold my hands and say something better than : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill up the buildings in which once independent sal@@ es@@ men were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part , in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and sen@@ timent through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates .
these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room .
the reason why he has such a si@@ ze@@ able number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was probably a bit too young to buy them , &quot; he says .
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much .
this is my truck .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets may apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media crowd , people who heard about the com@@ eback and decided to buy their old records .
from the conversations I have conducted , people usually got rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom to fans of the record holder of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to rever@@ t to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects that call happy memories of rejo@@ icing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be a empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to get involved spiritually .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an employee flo@@ ats from a sheet pile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey by the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record do not have record players .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I am smoo@@ ther through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead acoustic record to put them on the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more product @-@ saving , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have record players . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older people who come in slowly .
F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age girls and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sexually @-@ packed pop in place of experimental jazz bo@@ oms from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks odd , but the psychological trauma is hard to det@@ ach when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around in the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping than a big shopping .
she doesn &apos;t deserve much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I give the impression that jeans pants are stu@@ ffed , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing themselves around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v are right , they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they spend their th@@ ur@@ s@@ day morning with security not with bum@@ ble@@ bees from Ber@@ wick Street and sheets through plates , while they steer clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged men over the shoulders .

French court re@@ jects proposal on demo@@ lition of refugee camps in the refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary deals in which persons within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which hold a risk of fire and san@@ ity .
humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also explained that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people conducting the 72 Pro@@ visional business , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than simply feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated whol@@ ef@@ ly and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum seekers for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &quot; Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of refugees in the jungle has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of newcom@@ ers over the summer .
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
in spite of his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic time cycling pro Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get enter@@ tained .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , remain confident and continue fighting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he does not have an explanation for his mis@@ er@@ ably twel@@ fth place at the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in peace which reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything we have changed recently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is also my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who died on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes at Olympic Champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Be@@ am went to the start with his offer only in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players up missions and equi@@ p enemies as well as provide equipment .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ er has to focus on the next @-@ generation speed sensor : in various federal states , including Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units will be tested , which should be particularly effective against speed @-@ expos@@ ures .
the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for example in case of accidents , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police .
for example , at highway construction sites or bridges with temporary speed @-@ polishing , there are often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary bl@@ ater for maintaining speed limits .
a permanent mobile construction can , however , be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation , the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time across multiple tracks .
variable speed limits as well as passage prohi@@ bitions after time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , it is possible to move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with tow hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not simply cl@@ apped , it is lowered in the measurement operation , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sweat @-@ resistant outer shell disappear .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the car@@ ver from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
even foreign authorities flash with the new technology : recently France ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain gets silver in the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold picks up
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ 7 Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
Fi@@ ji has given a master class in handling , side @-@ stit@@ ching , retro@@ fitting , line running and ro@@ her strength to win gold - her first Olympic Med@@ al of any color .
the defeat was lost due to the not too bad con@@ sol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the considerable defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but independently of this , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least one Br@@ ite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , under R@@ yan they lost any game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they only lose one .
this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji started wonderful and caused the attacks of G@@ Bs to boun@@ ce off .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . an , as if you were running into running buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 as O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au stood in the corner .
with four minutes of playing , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a sle@@ ek@@ er T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the Mount of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third gate , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua left a Touch@@ down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the re@@ p and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ umes through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still learning .
this is how it is .
GB brought basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua crossed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play by Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for the UK , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went long in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ ans , whose fans s@@ wore , flags wave and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ amo made the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounds , the Fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced himself and GB ki@@ cked out cr@@ un@@ ched into the lawn .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain forced South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half forward , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , brother Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ less gold than with these games and that will mean something .
from the first ru@@ dder @-@ stroke to the last , 220 hard H@@ ieve , which go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning invented an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even if only the two were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in a row without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport who used such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all their 3@@ 9th uner@@ ring deployment , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant female athletes , gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph to go@@ ose .
behind every gold in the o@@ ars there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make up the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and it was no better than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and that did it .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty terrible situation .
it changes a bit the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if it was the right term in such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to go better soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice .
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts came to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ ering morning with something more than usual and tried to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s maybe something extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I have worked for , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
it was three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you goes to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person to train or to have a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the past five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close up , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were caught very at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we weren &apos;t looking for something great .
we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
Glo@@ ver has to appear next week at a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ grounds .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to realise that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; water utility association , Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water utility as a model for the large water producers .
some time ago in the original sound , it was said to be part of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk &apos;s contribution .
little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia honored the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ised as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the team of employees , 28 of them as Managing Director .
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , annually supports about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts exist for further towns and municipalities .
the current Chairman , Wid@@ brun@@ ner Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert joined G@@ öller in 1985 as a water atten@@ dant and was appointed Managing Director of the In@@ ner Association in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency missions on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event , it called the commissioning and inaugur@@ ation of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the acquisition of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the renewal of water pipes .
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added innovations , because water means life and drinking water is the most important food .
in their lau@@ dation Gö@@ ll@@ ers praised the faithful , reliable and correct service over the past 31 years .
he has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe on nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district .
for this he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful pop @-@ man .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as a highlight from his point of view he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association .
the biggest challenge and the most difficult task however were the rup@@ ture of the tu@@ b@@ ular at the church lou@@ der on a third of January .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the elevated tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who will succeed Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on a partner of life
on Friday , a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and injured her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man has called upon us and said to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and he will be publicly prosec@@ uted .
by now , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
the man is 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile the police released a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still bear the weapon , such as the police .
if you see Sven S. , you should call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police talks about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship at relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 .
at first the police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information about the crime or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , it confirmed that a person had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a deli@@ ri@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Task Force ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - German steel industry
the crisis @-@ shaken and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table .
it remains with the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Reform in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations tough after two years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
accordingly , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption .
according to German industry association , the steel industry costs an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ary Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills is an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent .
but also this will not be raised in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation .
in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely as@@ cer@@ tained .
Gabriel &apos;s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Steel of the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emission rights trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall head Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation increased further , when the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers submit price dump@@ ing to Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has eased a little bit .
on the one hand , tra@@ cked import duties on imported steel have an impact , on the other hand economic prospects in China have emerged .
it is unclear how sustainable the price pick @-@ up is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have been more stagn@@ ant .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 .
in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the year @-@ earlier month , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short increase in May , the quantity produced went back the second month consec@@ u@@ tively .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in emissions .
community , mind , health : singing makes sen@@ iors good
Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she reserved the subject music in the teacher &apos;s course , and today the 78 year old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing moves me emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she says .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind .
for S@@ ingen is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from a number of perspectives , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says from the German sen@@ iors division .
most sen@@ iors sing in the chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular meetings , senior citizens can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be ti@@ ring in a positive sense , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
in doing so , senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
those who demand their lungs regularly , do not get out of the pu@@ ste in everyday life as well .
even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice at age , singing is an optimal hobby .
for older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors Organ@@ iz@@ ations .
in the older generations , the common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs ar@@ ouses many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth .
lyrics and especially melodies reflect people who have fallen ill in long @-@ standing events .
in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz .
at the same time to focus on one &apos;s own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - that &apos;s a great cognitive challenge .
even older people who live alone do not only focus on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try out a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when a tone comes next to it ?
in search of the suitable offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces sings in a senior choir , one can easily connect .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet research .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing is good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as han@@ go@@ vers at scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover what effect the h@@ ops of k@@ itt@@ ens have on adult animals .
to her surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of patho@@ gen of k@@ itt@@ ens on the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von Kitt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Medical School Hannover ( M@@ H@@ H ) found out .
han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals are either indi@@ visible or not of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
in a previous examination , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens were different with the ur@@ gency of their need@@ iness .
a total of nine adult males and eight female cats were observed from the hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a call of little ones , who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more strongly arous@@ ed k@@ itt@@ ens , who were raised in addition .
despite the small sample , the researchers keep their results meaningful .
&quot; all the females , even those who had no offspring yet , responded to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding .
they turned out faster to the speaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ment of the very sof@@ ter k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may possibly be con@@ genital or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males were re@@ acting at all , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist .
in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans .
some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey , an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between the ves@@ tiges of Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even in the event of the exceptional state of emergency after the coup attempt in July , the government was be@@ holding the daily routine of normal citizens should not be com@@ promised .
this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it won &apos;t stop even before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former Stark@@ ick Hak@@ an Sü@@ ley@@ r .
according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ley@@ r is to be the advocate of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Ta@@ yy@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , this has virtually no impact on the lives of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy orph@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan &apos;s end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - divided into supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; especially fans of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bes@@ ik@@ tas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ sch .
even the fans even agree - no matter if their hearts beat for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at cup winner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will arrive particularly once again on Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne has proved its sporting value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top sc@@ orer of his association .
in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup to his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the rounds of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Champions League &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ ons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also pass early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g , it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed this and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the playing year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who , with 26 seasons of the season , laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 seasons of the season .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
in doing so , the Gom@@ ez referred to the Treaty of Florence , under contract and on the island of Bes@@ ik@@ tas , had been announced after the coup attempt to not return due to the political situation in the country following its European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Má@@ ri@@ ó wants to come to us , he just needs to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Club Director Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the storm would have to be ready to renoun@@ ce about one third of its annual salary of 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite D@@ oping : these athletes have still med@@ als &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chances at Olympia in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh - they fight for med@@ als in Rio .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who was compla@@ ining about a dop@@ ing barrier just before the games , was ki@@ cked out mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a super@@ imposed sm@@ iles , she was still stum@@ bled into the hall and had prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was clear that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience fell into a storm of tears .
but there are numerous other sports@@ men who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to wait a six @-@ month lock@@ out in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had a strong tooth@@ ache after an operation , and the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defending herself .
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , World Champion of 2013 and European Champion from 2010 to 2016 was positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant drug Meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin .
Per@@ kovic denied the inqu@@ isi@@ tive taking and was closed for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , had been positively tested in 2010 and closed 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement was responsible , mut@@ ed Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 year old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 metres .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer Th@@ row , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athlete has been awarded so many med@@ als afterwards .
thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after having detected testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympic silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games was also reg@@ ained due to a certificate of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world ranking list .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold favourite was only tested positive in May , but must nevertheless start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence of taking a forbidden food supplement was found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and was running on July 13 .
bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ror in Thailand - Austrian hurt - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
they have suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it .
her hom@@ ebo@@ und voyage was planned for the beginning of September .
whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ umph@@ on are also Austrian citizens , it is still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at some 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
on Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up , and another person was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach in Pat@@ ong which was popular among tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded which killed a city cler@@ k .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the Re@@ vier of the Co@@ ast@@ al Police .
finally , there were still det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ umph@@ on on the south @-@ east coast several injured .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it .
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings carry the same signature , &quot; said army general Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express itself on possible motives - but probably it is a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern in the attacks which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revol@@ t movement or with international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid .
in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed of the exact date and the locations .
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
the police ordered their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are again and again small bomb attacks , but they usually do not address tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the well @-@ known bombs explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary trips to these provinces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , improving economic situation and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , benefits from having restored the kingdom to stability and order .
however , the military did not manage to get a grip on the revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
nearly a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok in a stop at a popular Hind@@ u Shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office of Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several state offices , the conserv@@ ation@@ ists in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; we see evidence for aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional chief Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ined of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist ways .
therefore we observe the movement now as well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ Khan &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional Protection in nine German states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ined said that his authority was closely aligned with the state offices during the decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the constitution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with more you@@ thful speech , often with pop music .
the identi@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a fu@@ tile advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly suscep@@ tible to this .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , there have been reports from several federal states about contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ined said he had no knowledge about that .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - changes its target direction and becomes extrem@@ ist by certain people who are extrem@@ ist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such individuals have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not apparent .
in view of the substantial increase in right @-@ wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ined said he would not yet speak of new right terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ wing structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing groups or small groups are planning to plan attacks on asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of right @-@ wing terrorism cannot be seen .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
some people worried about the fact that there were many violations of the people &apos;s account that had not appeared in the right scene before .
that is the wor@@ rying .
many of the suspect &apos;s attacks on asylum camps were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right @-@ wing scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing in common with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who perhaps were politically in@@ different , or elected for example , CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who then radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mood . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympics or world records set the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly over@@ wei@@ ghted swi@@ mmer of Ethiopia came so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cli@@ pping was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te was then become a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first race with a 48 second back and finished the 5@@ 9th position of 59 starts .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure attracting the attention of the international media .
why should the 24 @-@ year @-@ old participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start @-@ up right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more familiar .
as most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something different .

post enters into trading with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle seems to be great .
the Post is planning to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter too .
the Group will soon start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the post intends to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether it will sell its self @-@ developed road sco@@ oter with which letters and pack@@ ets will be delivered to other businesses .
post office Jürgen Ger@@ des had said there are always re @-@ en@@ quiries , such as tra@@ des@@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bonn Group wants to enter into mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in post @-@ production , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ des had announced that the company wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars , and in the long run put a complete change@@ over to the eco @-@ friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;

GF@@ RP leadership ap@@ points dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K sw@@ aps his head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the res@@ ign@@ ations suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research group Gf@@ K made it clear that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the corporate management , the number five in the industry is facing a new beginning .
G@@ RP CEO plans to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert already reti@@ res from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 .
as early as September 1 , the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ erk@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger handed over the company to the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the long @-@ term business policy as a reason for the res@@ ign@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ man on Friday did not want to mention details .
it is still unclear who will be conducting market research activities in future .
in investor circles it was called on Friday , in the shareholders the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago was great .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , cannot be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recently bad Gf@@ K business figures , every investor becomes rest@@ less at some point . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; it said .
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the company had not been able to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at € 36@@ 1.2 million , sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the same quarter of the previous year .
based on the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros declined by 3.4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter was particularly imp@@ acted by the company &apos;s decline in its economic situation in the face of its difficult economic situation .
in the Consumer Experience business area , the company &apos;s impairment of EUR 139 million became a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K had yet generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus slides in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ bu@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
in the case of an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ bu@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the det@@ ain@@ ees suffered serious injuries , the police informed them .
according to her information , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to ev@@ ade a truck which was partly on the counter .
the bus desc@@ ended to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independently , &quot; she said .
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a ambul@@ ance car came to the scene of the accident on the provincial road 2 .
the ir@@ res@@ isti@@ ble travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ bu@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators called on the trucks and possible witnesses to report to the police .
as of October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre wastewater will take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sh@@ ahl 3,@@ 44 instead of previously 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 euros ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the installation in Az@@ endorf the wastewater charge will be increased at the latest if necessary improvement measures are necessary .
after an over@@ slu@@ gg@@ ish calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the budget was approved by the district council Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was established that under@@ cover was used for these sewage installations .
due to legal bases , the Kas@@ bah market is obliged to operate the systems in a cost @-@ effective manner .
from 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as head of management Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated .
Schmidt explained the serious fee increases by providing relatively small installations with a very low sewage plant , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
thus , due to the small deployment , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining .
as a result of their age , refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses were to a considerable extent not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for the Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p are almost 20 years old .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system in the wastewater treatment plant in Az@@ endorf had to be replaced by a damage .
in the pumping station of Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage system had to be removed , the sewage slu@@ dge was disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued care and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which are still below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stone houses made it clear that in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully integrated &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the process , Schmidt added that the market community of large entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed in the past 20 years .
the situation for the above @-@ mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the long run , especially as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater treatment association can not be extended by these systems , because they are defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were booked .
the average annual average of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price rise of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to breeds .
with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat enables around 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ interpretations are transmitted to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting Black@@ face promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week proposed a filter to some users , who gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and j@@ erk@@ ed che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat announced that it turned off the feature .
the company offered an excuse : the filter was intended as an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism reminded the filter of breaking c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Cas@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose twe@@ ets were widespread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ ting and the thread was said to be unpleasant . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgu@@ sting Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and filter effects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow face was drawn into the descending extrem@@ ity .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stum@@ bling set .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counter@@ parts - might expect more likely to expect sensitivity .
when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things go un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the large part of white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors who work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely left un@@ answered .
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday Sn@@ ap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently set up a HR manager focusing on inter @-@ represented population groups and internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu also said she &apos;s going to close her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fy IS@@ IS intelligence service , establish Committee of Con@@ gresses
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw a more optimistic view of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site , reported an investigation committee of the Congress in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the Army Com@@ mittees , Secret Service Com@@ mittees and the Army Com@@ mit@@ ment Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how supervis@@ ors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence information , typically em@@ ph@@ ased by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , recorded a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently more positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report .
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , a repub@@ li@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organisation .
the 10 @-@ page report shows permanent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing government leaders under Obama &apos;s instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced pressure from their hierarch@@ ies to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command testim@@ oni@@ als , statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ com party publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it &apos;s so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of Con@@ gres@@ s@@ men from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to mid @-@ 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to put down the danger posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed knowledge , while the investigations will continue .
in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are under way by the Secretary @-@ General of the Ministry of Defense .
on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com has created an over@@ ly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments of IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ level demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Schiff said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the moral among analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was too little room for diver@@ gent opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of finding the White House interfer@@ ing with the Cent@@ com analysts with regard to a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor , who were taken up by Cent@@ com analysts .
according to C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense did not comment on reports of the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful campaign of air under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an alle@@ gation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ orable assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupation force in Iraq and did little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting about the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team confirmed that contrary to the government &apos;s statements against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State , there was no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries were commissioned to sell oil on the black market .
however , this knowledge was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger Commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature for his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the United States wins fourth match in women &apos;s field hockey , a show@@ down with Britain is imminent
one day after having shot three doors during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember this ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
however , they know that the American women are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons at first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams .
the first placed will take the strong Dutch some longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
as always the game starts on Saturday , American women have triggered a surprising whi@@ r@@ l through their success story , four years after they ended up in the last London games on the last of 12 seats .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years in hands ( her two older sisters played sports at Dre@@ xel University ) , at 16 years she became a national player in the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn &apos;t qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team , began to turn things into a better one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder altogether .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a back@@ stroke from the local area .
India had entered the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the goal to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the go@@ al@@ keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , as late it is , it is the Olympics .
the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly feeling and in@@ escap@@ ably , a rapid relay race between competition and striving .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to the swi@@ mmer to the athlete to the tri@@ athlete .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympics , and a s@@ warm of women with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV ads , if he were a swi@@ mmer , a gym@@ n@@ ast or even a fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , is fighting for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not highlight every event .
further from the centre , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
but if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it became so spar@@ se that many of the things I had questioned did not know that it is at all an Olympic champion .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to the competition , it has never won a medal in jumping on tramp@@ ol@@ ines and has had an athlete up to 2012 who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women .

the trampoline jumping has some out@@ sider &apos;s charm , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ schule than that sounds for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an enthusi@@ ast enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports which essentially unites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
asp@@ iring champi@@ ons jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are rated according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts have to go further , faster , up and down in their quest for gold , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and down , up and down at the playground .
they don &apos;t just ch@@ ase the finish line or the starting wall , but also a further highlight in television transmission : the world or the Olympics .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel fati@@ gu@@ ing myself when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the V@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly up .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the target , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant suspension of time and gravity .
it is as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
the qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; that of the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will broadcast the final hours as part of a afternoon block from 2 p.m. onwards .
in the midst of the Olympic Man@@ ia , they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tum@@ ult .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and obj@@ ecting of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base .
&quot; one generation protests in Ethiopia , Long An ally of the United States
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who call for political change in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that , during the clas@@ hes with the police , tens of thousands of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiop@@ ian right to collapse ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West , with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded in more and more areas .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political change .
the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less according to human rights organisations .
witnesses stated that police fired and killed tens of thousands of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
videos being circul@@ ated about the protests , probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group .
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terrorist attacks beyond the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ ew@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiopia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the whole youth protests .
a generation is prot@@ esting .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil usage to stran@@ gle@@ hold in terms of power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely @-@ critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament .
at the same time , the tensions continue along the Er@@ it@@ rea border ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ ga@@ den , which have been forced more or less during the last years , could benefit from the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are now explo@@ ding under the surface under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially among protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were so prot@@ esting .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ persi@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s mainly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ lands .
but that too is changing .
&quot; we are to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos .
the greatest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
many Am@@ persi@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , until his death on a not @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively opa@@ que reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uph@@ eav@@ al in 2005 , after thousands of poll@@ s prot@@ ested , apparently deceived by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed even if it was less than in recent months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal abuse of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and she assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ic city , led businesses from Tig@@ ray and hate against the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests spread the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighbouring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his statement Obama had founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump , on Friday , tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ing that his multiple @-@ repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton , would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication created new questions on the communication skills of Republi@@ can Republi@@ can candidate , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings about his fellow campaig@@ ners who endeav@@ our to take him in protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position to explain the statements he could not have meant .
after he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump rec@@ alled the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out , the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Tr@@ ump told in a number of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it .
the last storm of criticism un@@ le@@ ashes Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling surveys .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; Of course , I said , &quot; Of course , sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates .
but I also believe he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even et@@ ched note , as his demand values have gone further .
a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour .
but while rein@@ forcing the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ ump &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , made a big effort to defend the candidate today in a Thursday CN@@ N interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani compla@@ ined about Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s statement about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ gler , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out by forcing it to take control of the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the PA election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump took off his attacks on the media and accused them of carrying around each of his words and being taken against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , miserable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; TV experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ fit for the presi@@ dency .
once pressed about the price from the market , cafe in Green@@ point comes back
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ red@@ ded café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which didn &apos;t have Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were sup@@ planted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So@@ ap Cher@@ ie &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; business , replacing Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
local people claimed it as the last loss in a city @-@ ri@@ dden city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exemp@@ ted and Ver@@ b now is a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is changing , it is also new invention .
a re @-@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing associate of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered to provide money for a new outdoor table , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot of things .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same bulbs from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and sau@@ erk@@ raut .
there are nature dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said .
recently at a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and visited the verb regularly .
even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb had closed , she gave up coffee drinking for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came quarters after seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients in the menu .
nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had no res@@ ent@@ ment that the soap business took the old business space .
in fact , the owners of the soap cherry offered Cher@@ ie to make a special soap with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on offering her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preten@@ ded to exhibit her soon so that his new neighbors would feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice shop would like to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a nearby building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and the ordering felt a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a delic@@ acy , President Roosev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land &apos;s ter@@ rap@@ in soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
Co@@ es &apos;s last book , &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey , &quot; was about Chinese cuisine in the USA , while bri@@ ck@@ yard was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective .
their latest collaboration , &quot; An decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop , a small , non @-@ local snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of 1929 .
bri@@ ck@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable dishes .
when the re@@ porter hack@@ ed min@@ ced , this took place the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said .
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating so many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have been like lead in the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cook for male fel@@ lows and it was served freshly baked past@@ as for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; traces the ways in which the country was surrounded not to be the land of lar@@ gen@@ land .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food was a central , ten@@ se issue for Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious food like bread and sau@@ cep@@ ans became stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food lef@@ to@@ vers , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , as chefs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit .
meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rarely servi@@ ced luxury .
unique bl@@ ends have been tried out since a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has prim@@ acy over taste or even healthy cooking .
during their research for the book , which includes recipes , Bri@@ ck@@ man prepared a dish from this period , fried onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the domestic business recipes .
as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - exagger@@ ated the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; and the challenge to transform pamp@@ h@@ lets like cre@@ amy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historic delicacies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the reports on the response of the government to hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cake @-@ eating attitude , are particularly tasty .
while he openly praised the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million@@ th man of the world he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
President Roosev@@ elt would probably have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roosev@@ elt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
many of the types of the Great Depression Er@@ a to deal with food became disc@@ arded as soon as the country came back to the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as how science was applied to foods .
the couple tried to better understand the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was afraid of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she actually made people ill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the case of the wind .
after the plate at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s was cleared , they and Co@@ e prepared a dessert that they had prepared at home : the Pf@@ lau@@ men@@ eutical , which served President Roosev@@ elt at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a common plo@@ y to miss a nice name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone turned a bit reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E won three times a supplement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed at bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set up his own life to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved some 60@@ ,000 lives .
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own lives on the ground to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the face of the group : a video of the civil defence , which shows him at an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol of symbol@@ ism in the hor@@ r@@ ors of war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said al@@ oud : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me it is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I die to save lives , I think God has a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , which was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , lest children play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the image c@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old

Greenland shar@@ k usually only comes to the surface only in winter .
this Ha@@ i was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland shar@@ k only receives offspring with 150 years of age .
lei@@ surely the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is average just 1,@@ 220 metres far .
only when it matters is the five @-@ meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle influenced by slow@@ ness seems to be a patent for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case of a Greenland shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock comments this life span , which represents a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist probably gu@@ essed that Greenland &apos;s hair became stone age .
only the evidence was missing .
Greenland shar@@ k is difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hair .
their slow speed was when they out@@ fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
loo@@ t nevertheless make this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and seek cad@@ aver , which tor@@ ches from higher water @-@ layers downward .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ sh@@ arks , who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest Ha@@ i was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the l@@ enti@@ l nucle@@ us .
their birth was therefore likely to lie in the early 1960s , when a search for a nuclear proliferation of nuclear weapons threw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimet@@ res , the l@@ enti@@ cular nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , which is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
all major Greenland shar@@ k , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in their l@@ enti@@ ls , resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 @-@ cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res is even 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers have been able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland shar@@ k with the multip@@ lication obviously makes at least one and a half centuries time .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
that such meth@@ ot@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence .
the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland whale , in whose bacon on the neck was plu@@ gged into a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a fl@@ aming fire .
so they mature later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gives heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the evolution@@ ist bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest his resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
the municipal council has mainly focused on issues relating to building in the recent meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the committee adopted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of recently designated residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sale of land plots in the residential areas of &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( Bin@@ der@@ strasse area - section 1 ) is no longer in the way of interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the cultivation areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau appeal to young families and senior citizens alike .
as it was said , building will@@ s can now report to the Town Hall , and the municipal council is expected to give advice on the allocation of par@@ c@@ els in its September meeting .
in order to make inquiries about the settlement of further business enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year in sub @-@ areas .
thus in the area of Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n , the already designated commercial area is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances to attract jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the Centre of Excellence for financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money homes will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is enough for them to be approved in the UK . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are currently taking advantage of large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , such as the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which unites the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk cor@@ p ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
Luxembourg certainly conce@@ als a large fund sector , but it also makes it worse for the infrastructure of Dublin .
Frankfurt is much easier to achieve thanks to the large airport .
the city also points to readily available commercial properties .
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not easy to find high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder .
at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are 50 percent higher than in the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition due to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the company consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city ranked 7th in number 7 , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a financial hub for the European domestic market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , econom@@ ists .
according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt , it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead gets legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
an American Ju@@ dge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbur@@ se the legal costs incurred by her from H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with Pharmac@@ eutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a U.S. judge covered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jur@@ ism and other un@@ ethical actions .
when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , US President Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction in costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck is trying to equi@@ p with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck agreed to su@@ e each other and claim ownership of laboratory work to which Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir is underlying , the active ingredient in the medicines of Gilead .
troops supported by the USA say they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday .
according to the statement of the still remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are currently comb@@ ating the city .
they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stage by the fighters , Shar@@ jah told Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters who was al@@ lied with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we are going to run clean@@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the democr@@ ats and their husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5,@@ 3 million in Rede@@ kop ; the former Foreign Minister gave an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clin@@ tons candidate for vice @-@ pres@@ idents , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , in collaboration with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax returns for the past decade .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Kaiser continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and withdrawal regarding his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax statements , although they are not oblig@@ ated by law .
Tr@@ ump , a New Yorker business man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax check by the tax authorities as reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the move , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , special advis@@ er , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax checks were not completed .
critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business groups and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and posted a video on the internet on Friday , asking high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lic@@ ans Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the subject also during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that during the 1990s , Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist from the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka last week , Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters , called Tr@@ ump to meet their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons &apos;s campaign has reviewed the tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective tax rate of around 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of around 40@@ ,5 % .
the 2015 Clin@@ tons tax statement showed that they were only $ 100 of their income as a reward , unlike most Americans .
its main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings from USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ des , fire@@ works support dance ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ rea .
the method has proven effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , intensified its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals .
before that , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the day of the world , dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , being much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants out of their fields without hur@@ ting the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the manager of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message .
the first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the f@@ use cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ t fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ des into the air .
a touch is usually already out to hunt the elephant .
a last possibility is a laun@@ cher shooting a fire@@ work fire@@ work in the air , causing a loud , bright explosion .
city council decides unanim@@ ously : no new building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

the City Council , however , now unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the construction of a sale sky on the bank of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s , which is currently under construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamentally , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the bank of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jewish director crum@@ bles Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election has been removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uph@@ eav@@ al after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israeli pre @-@ elections , as it had requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the property selection list .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ ink@@ si B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center .
after an explanation , the director approached the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sent him &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind this was even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election be deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann cited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet where people called it sc@@ andal@@ ous .
some were subordin@@ ating to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have indul@@ ged in the alleged re@@ for@@ estation of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said it in a different article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is in the vicinity of a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order not to include Israel in the quick election list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a speaker at the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police deplo@@ ys tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms in the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart , causing the police to introduce rubber com@@ rade and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on their plans .
according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students will be converted to save money .
some of the participants saw Gra@@ ffi@@ ti@@ ts spra@@ ying on walls against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er .
the recent protests took place several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who was dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest on the part of Russian businesses grew strongly in businesses in the country , the ambassador announced .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new firms are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran was 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trade lift was accomplished by supplies of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
last year , the Russian foreign representation made around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes it will change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses wanted : beverage market fall over in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y rob@@ ber@@ y has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening at Re@@ we XXL &apos;s drink market at Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the support of a fire@@ arm , three dark dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the publication of cash from the staff of the drink market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money was captured , the police did not share with them .
the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 metres , thus relatively small .
the drink market is accessible and poorly accessible from the park deck of the Re@@ we market .
the perpetr@@ ators must be sc@@ anned in the direction Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from the gravel parking garage located opposite the parking garage with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 hrs ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : play and fun during fre@@ t time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection federation Nag@@ old with their assistants on their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
during the first week of school holidays , the life @-@ joyful group was lod@@ ged in the quiet holiday home of hard @-@ water .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ save with the visit to the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days the group lived in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing .
for culinary purposes , children and care@@ gi@@ vers with their self @-@ prepared foods such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ itt@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were culinary .
in workshops was cur@@ led , beautiful jewelry made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home , the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : a pilgri@@ m to the portal of mercy
the mini@@ stran@@ ts from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four phases were ma@@ stered .
in order to bridge the time to the next Rom@@ ance journey of all mini@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Ober@@ minist@@ ran@@ ten@@ berg St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various places of pilgrimage have been tried and one finally decided for the B@@ ish@@ ops City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination was offered for the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy .
16 And Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt went on the way .
in the evening before , the priest sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage , and blessed the pilgrims .
from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where a Mu@@ en@@ ster Un@@ ser@@ er loved woman was standing and so the pilgri@@ m departed from Münster .
the individual tours were framed in the morning and evening , depending on a brief impulse , with different prayers , songs and written texts .
but also on the way the Min@@ is repeatedly made a break at field crosses , chap@@ els or churches to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrims &apos; booklet .
for the nights , each parish church of the local par@@ ishes was available .
at the stage destinations Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller created a tasty and star@@ chy dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day we took the stage to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting route , but at first the heat had to be covered by some 500 metres altitude and then climbed again .
the earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathroom feast in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in St. Peter &apos;s imposing monastery church , we went to Freiburg on the final stage .
the Min@@ is was visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy at the later afternoon at the Freiburg Cathedral and passed through the gate of mercy .
with a small impulse , God was thank@@ ed here .
in the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t .
after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the metropolis of Brei@@ s@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked .

England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic gold med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place at the World Championships in London in March , despite the entrance of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a warning .
Ho@@ y &apos;s retirement produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton were trying to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner scored a olymp@@ ic record in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
Hin@@ der was slightly back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner stopped .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation from which Hin@@ der drove in a higher gear , to slow down it and allow Kenn@@ y and foremost Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der as they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic Port in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the 2012 triumph on the Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys page , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he deliberately dropped onto the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no appeal of England &apos;s rival .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like all the UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we joined our team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome .
with the form Kenn@@ y , it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a contest .
that would mean Kenn@@ y - who was just 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be equivalent to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
yesterday he had fought with the officers before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition that will be continued tomorrow and finished , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the UK Team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a medal of med@@ als .
after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
there was drama in the background , with Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton &apos;s res@@ ignation in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying charges as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the suspension of the energy contract question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations - are at stake , as the plant operator canc@@ els the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , as the supplying energy company announced .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , not to award any further subsidies for the operation of the plant .
a subsi@@ dy laid down for 20 years runs out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the system of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land stand on the game .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk during closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting plant consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victori@@ as .
in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry Mel@@ ting mill , which led to closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year .
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
this step follows the long @-@ term spec@@ ulations regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting shop with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power station in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means another physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should come into effect from November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from this point AG@@ L expects that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all potential rami@@ fications for AG@@ L &apos;s income from G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong term markets for wholesale electricity prices . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AG@@ L shared that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ability to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al@@ coa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which should have entered into force from November this year , even if there is still an explanation why it res@@ igned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions of the industry , analysts warn of the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
in reference to analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year and around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and for us as a generator , that wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the sought after September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thursday .
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote .
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a critical reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show bi@@ z uncle and producers of keeping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ re : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é of almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon chann@@ elling at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to somehow participate in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has begun .
K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes to have sm@@ itten the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband k@@ any@@ e West were to be seen on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most sold issue of the year .
with a circum@@ ference that rather resembles an image tape as a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( aut fashi@@ on@@ ista were advertisement from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover @-@ star is expected so long@@ ingly that in the last two years , pictures of the magazine se@@ ep through the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oscar prize @-@ winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover for 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true for Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career .
of course J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone .
with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been a bit ten@@ se .
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ s of the moment . &quot;
these feelings cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to walk around on the mis@@ fortune seems to pass by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the true sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell images of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures from C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal Law Centr@@ es exhibit 160@@ ,000 people each year
more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s aid in the country is rejected annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry is preparing for the effects of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy people , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ culture and the like - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality are ready for further cuts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the director of the Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l Municip@@ ality Centre said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worsen@@ ed without the federal government &apos;s decision .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means that thousands of people of important services that you need are rejected , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dischar@@ ged by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
by June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of state @-@ needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to promptly lift these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the provincial government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time to look at the needs of the community centres and their clients and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Elec@@ toral Campa@@ ign acc@@ ted after Emplo@@ ye@@ es allegedly We@@ ak We@@ ap@@ ons
new York : Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign has been indic@@ ted for alleged in@@ action after it was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina set up a fire@@ arm in February while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted to Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i on Wednesday , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he asked for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realized &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign manager , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a pist@@ ol , put his right hand index on the trigger , and cur@@ sed the race at Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i announced in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
having compla@@ ined to local and regional campaign management , B@@ ordin@@ i realized that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to cause harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he admitted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate released a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People - gun@@ men and arms friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was to be elected and judge .
the campaign clearly showed that the media had torn his words from the context and that it would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ i &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and Philip because of bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
the s@@ ling@@ backs of the press spokes@@ woman Hope Hi@@ cks were not to be reached for a comment .
attempts to contact Philip struck equally .
W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer an employee of the campaign .
he did not respond to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services .
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate , Donald Tr@@ ump , has so far led a controversial campaign .
the procedure is B@@ ordin@@ i by Donald J. Tr@@ ump For President Inc . , 16 @-@ CS @-@ 14@@ 300 , Supreme Court , County of Mecklenburg ( Charlotte ) .
Berlin / Schwer@@ in : pol@@ l before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U losing
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) considerable losses are notable for the SPD and CD@@ U government parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this resulted in representative surveys by the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the red @-@ black government coalition could barely continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey figures in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD , however , would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD crashed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party was only margin@@ ally ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would be 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , and the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the parliament .
despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at 3 percent in the parliament .
according to the survey , the SPD , according to the survey , only came to 23 per cent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it still remains behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented in the department store for the first time at 14 percent .
with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , whereas the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - the maker experienced a disaster .
the tool weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was pretty cl@@ unk@@ y .
the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ aby@@ tes , which would range today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes .
the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator came to business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone .
for a few euros fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Inter@@ Net Tournam@@ ent .
20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ Format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even accessing websites was possible via HTML browsers , albeit slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
very proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. approximately 1400 euro .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody could suspect in August 1996 that the Communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story , even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s cell phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually being sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market domin@@ ates vendors that all came much later than Nokia .
always and everywhere online , that is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life .
there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide in 2015 .
about 1.4 billion devices were sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales of the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been developed around the smartphone .
at the beginning of 2007 , Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use .
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession began , and today the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who dominated the market had a look .
she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now has Apple and Asian suppliers like Samsung .
20 years after his invention , the smartphone is a matter of course .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the Smartphone away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
for our local communities , we will alone have 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs , and youth unemployment in the airport environment end .
just as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ bed on the world stage .
the two @-@ f@@ ishers had injustice in 2012 and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for single an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in social growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and to the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - which was chosen for five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal to T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks of the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .
Lord Paul D@@ mit@@ ton is the Chairman of the He@@ ath@@ row Board and For@@ mer Commercial Secretary to the Treas@@ ury
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and Maus@@ san@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot; &quot; &quot;
for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to b@@ ypass ad blocking are the same as a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blo@@ gging on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block again ads in the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook shared that its desktop page would change the coding on its advertisements to make it more difficult to identify which part of the page advertisement is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in and Her battle between the an@@ tim@@ el@@ ting open source community and the b@@ yp@@ hi@@ ers has been in progress since the invention of display blo@@ wers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media enterprise has embark@@ ed on the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator block@@ ers have become for the industry .
according to a study conducted by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide , according to a study , nearly four times as much as 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertis@@ ers &quot; ads .
the company has no effect on desktop PCs since mobile ad blo@@ wers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a speaker shared .
advertisement on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient amount of revenue , so that Facebook seems to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ad preference tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block &apos;s new filters were wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a dum@@ b means , so instead we focus on developer tools like Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .

a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d .
it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was over@@ run by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police told them to report these as well as any witness of the incident .
an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter informed the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve .
it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the At@@ tor@@ ney must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian flows in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after having crossed and killed a man who lay in the A1 near Pay@@ erne for a night in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , the Court accepted .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- responding to an emergency call -- went to an justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have her@@ al@@ ded similar conditions with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , earth @-@ like atmosphere and slowly turned on .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protect from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat .
the result are average temperatures , some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , resem@@ bling evolution previously suspected of planetary research .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light over the course of several billion years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was burned away by ultra@@ violet light .
when their hydro @-@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy returns as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to a low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement .
over the course of the summer , I have thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , that it needs and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the Vision of the Train@@ ers and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
it also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , Patrick informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer in the league .
he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was hit in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the low season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , set off strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the labour disputes relating to the remuneration for North @-@ Sea workers are suspended , while all the parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will stop several full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks , which will start next year to address the problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has reduced rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent decline in on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismissed thousands of people for its part and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union .
at the beginning of this week , Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea since one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers collect the most complete catalog of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in what connection the rotation time periods are with planet creation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning fastest .
at peak @-@ rotation @-@ rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magn@@ et@@ osphere of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star ages , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star patch -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars rotating more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; at the P@@ lei@@ ades Ballet , we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull .
there is much more to us about what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates , and so to speak , hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the web press rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of base to base .
after his emotional res@@ ignation , the 41 year old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say goodbye to Goo@@ db@@ ye , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a 10 @-@ year contract guaranteed him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary .
as a player Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he made some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two bas@@ eball players show similar values in the most important statistics .
however , the 41 year old should not be included in the rest @-@ hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; admitted to have forbidden ster@@ oids from 2001 to 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed for 2@@ 11 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the prime suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favour for the year 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , at that time , cute . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his farewell days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends occupy the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , were told , sympathy @-@ feelings of fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ ale Boston Red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympia 2016 : from X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can &apos;t start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wi@@ ped athlete had won almost a medal .
before the seventh competition Day , the first official dop@@ ing events have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the critically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions this news came about .
in Ch@@ en the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de has been demonstrated last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had the fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only about 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the events of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court and will accept the judgement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history the IO@@ C is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news le@@ aked out about the positive sample of Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she was innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be nutritional supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the athle@@ tic lady . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to be the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O in the forbidden substance .
G@@ dan@@ ek@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov reported immediately with criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , about all weight lif@@ ters from the chronic dop@@ ing @-@ loaded nation are not allowed to participate in Rio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg , was tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days before . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both of them deny the intake , but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the athletes start , the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ äu@@ fer@@ Nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in addition , in swimming sports , the former depar@@ tures in China also ensured violent confron@@ tations between the athletes .
Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to give up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun also stood at the centre of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 Sun was positively tested for the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ de in Chinese championships , but only had to wait for a three @-@ month lock .
data lau : so per@@ fi@@ de , hack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware currently attack targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
according to a recent survey by the malware protection specialist , Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , accounted for 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months at least once , several times the victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , the perpetr@@ ators are special@@ ising in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potential to be raised will be significantly higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
it was not until the end of the month that private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ bly fast in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently modified files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the Ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail@@ ers .
in order to get the encryption key to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin - .
but where private users have the personal photo database at stake , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stops .
the damage is correspon@@ d@@ ingly higher if a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes .
22 per cent of German companies reported exchange losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to inter@@ rupt the business operation , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of catar@@ acts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay receive their data again .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetr@@ ators in view of stand@@ still in operation .
the hack@@ ers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , F @-@ Secure safety researchers investigated the user &apos;s surface area and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and came to the result : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money .
they explain their cas@@ u@@ alties via chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t free sample files for free .
and , after payment of a few hundred euros , individuals will be rede@@ emed , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts in order to get their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail the hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the Cloud Drive provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware roughly within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the existing malware kits have been created by using the Malware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ off , fixed price between $ 1000 and $ 10,000 .
&quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ ers then look for further hack@@ ers in order to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service economy .
so you log in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payments are made per certified calcul@@ ator .
&quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t sp@@ amm@@ ers with the dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better safeguard their data .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey are confident that Ran@@ som@@ ware can be able to rep@@ el Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful testing alone , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the type of data , the potential for damage is much higher than before .
in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could also target completely new targets on the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter , the activation of such a blocked central heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
the materials of the interior are well @-@ crafted and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l for raised and 10@@ 26 l back@@ rests , but there is the Magic Se@@ ats .
this is less magical than it sounds : the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the ground to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide re@@ v ranges .
however , he should do his work somewhat more quietly .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
another engine is available : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed control re@@ acts to the traffic sign detection and throt@@ tles the speed when needed .
the full connectivity is available only for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat aw@@ k@@ ward to achieve .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with Euro 6 emission standards .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : down@@ fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable with dangers which are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , the court .
the airline didn &apos;t have to pay any compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the Organ@@ izer pay
after their trip , sick vac@@ ation@@ ers only get money back when the cause of the disease is doub@@ t@@ lessly found in the hotel .
however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests are shown to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was seriously ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ ni@@ cation .
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly polluted sea water .
the family thought that the trip was therefore fla@@ wed - and compla@@ ined to the organisers .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ffs did not have any success in court .
the sewage plant was indeed defective .
but the promot@@ er only learned about it shortly before the departure of the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to assume that the sea water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his obligation to provide information , thus the verdict .
no im@@ puri@@ ties have been found in the water samples .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly through infection with each other - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
according to the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be sensible and determined at the same time to react to terror haz@@ ards .
certainly , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and sch@@ ism .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if perpetr@@ ators need to leave the country more quickly , this will increase security and strengthen the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wants to achieve a realization of the proposals right up to the 2017 Bundestag election . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mid @-@ four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; CC@@ TV surveillance should be improved , which will be am@@ ended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the internet is increasingly difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the recently discussed duty of confidentiality for physicians should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions that can reduce the threat of citizens , he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act the radi@@ cal@@ isation of refugees , the Minister holds a better social support .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further improve security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior was clearly opposed to action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an ear file for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union following a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double citizenship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a general ban on full @-@ wear is not constitu@@ tionally problemati@@ cal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you refuse , and I refuse the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
you can talk about rules for example in road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green editor Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister that he wanted to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorism packages of energy and action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people in this country no more safety . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the free@@ way feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this is to change : the legal remedy should be extended .
this is good news for all cars , who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jams , when they drive over the motorway ( A 43 ) .
on the coming Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 @-@ 17 August ) , the road construction company extends the right @-@ hand bend in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Street to the right .
the advantage of this is that traffic is divided in the early stages , which improves the overall flow of traffic on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the districts of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the back@@ stage extends up to the bridge over the Alber@@ ian Way and sometimes beyond .
the reason is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , traffic is only guided via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ four@@ ths of years ago .
the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to record heavy duty traffic in two lanes .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related daily traffic jam will continue , the responsible state company cannot say .
however , with years to expect : because the bridge has an official remaining duration until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal de@@ fle@@ ction , the state @-@ owned company deliberately selected the traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays because with disabilities is to be expected .
the traffic will be conducted on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The In@@ visible House &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students aged eleven and 15 years visited the production in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster in the context of this project .
most of the young people in the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster .
the organisation N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from language , and the Junge Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
from October to December , adolescents with and without escape and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dancing , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language placement are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased number of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvements
the weather has made the star @-@ sni@@ ff @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany a stroke through the bill on the night for Friday - but there is still hope .
the night was bad for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning .
our hope lies on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are per@@ s@@ ands belonging to the fastest shooting stars at 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour .
they have their names because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes up in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally , at night , one lies awake for hours , in the morning is already well ahead of the wak@@ eup bell no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one @-@ quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing .
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders occur ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes for them , says Hans @-@ Günter We@@ Geb@@ r , member of the board of the German Society for Sle@@ eping and S@@ leep Medicine .
what one understands for the time being , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. a sing@@ le- and dor@@ man@@ t @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when sleeping , many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the Executive Board of the German Medical Association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind it can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently is the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early w@@ aking up is often common in a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ y . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
those who , for example , have a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie bad , wake up every two to three hours and possibly begins to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , gives them an example .
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor , advises
the impairment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache .
to ease sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
among other things , treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleep @-@ medical centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is hardly available in Germany .
for this reason , when sleeping problems , one should first turn to the family doctor , &quot; Me@@ eß . &quot;
this can be done with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep , and what happens ?
for example , in the case of snor@@ ing , doctors advise doctors , for example , in snor@@ ing with respiratory stimul@@ ators , in case of abnormal day@@ time fatigue , sleep trans@@ duc@@ ers , or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , &quot; Fi@@ etze explains .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not make a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after cl@@ inging , you go to bed at its normal time .
in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a sensor at the finger .
there is also a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of screws on which you can apply for a better sleep .
it includes : regular sleep and up@@ lift times , do not sleep too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for sleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German float Markus Dei@@ f has expressed himself on Facebook as a dis@@ ap@@ pointing inter@@ ruption of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ us .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the World Cup in Doh@@ a , while at the same time he set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ athlete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates who are standing in front of his critic@@ isms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € bonus and a jungle of € 150@@ ,000 no one should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page during the night on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the transport system in swimming is bad , but dop@@ ing control is very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look closely at the issue of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be stopped here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ f would have to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how it should be kept in countries .
&quot; those who are not able to control a certain amount of time before World Cup / OS by independent directors of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election Hamburg , who now operates an ice cream shop .
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Dus@@ sel@@ dorf Airport
the police of the police of Düsseldorf managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage ste@@ els as a gang .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the police from past theft events .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences this year since the middle of July , and had proc@@ eeded in a community , division and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the crime com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can demonstrate four actions to thi@@ eves who had entered Germany especially for the off@@ ence of criminal off@@ ences .
they had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros .
old buildings , a few lime trees , in between there is still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
if one walks along the road from east to west , one passes at play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it will be built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , will be favor@@ ed by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rental contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin Interior sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard drive of the police against the project , the area referred to as &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
on June 22 , the rooms on the ground floor , the Ca@@ det s@@ mi@@ ths , were cleared with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ rolled official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , construction workers on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners renovated the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the evi@@ ction had been illegal , and a day later police and construction workers went down under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents .
on this afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others enter@@ tain in front of late i .
a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects .
left violence is not the main concern of many local residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is raising three children here , is mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who wanted more police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating lef@@ ti@@ sts .
the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police do between the occup@@ iers and their neighbours does not exist .
Friedrichsha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city .
also house occup@@ ations and the resulting housing projects have been part of the neighborhood for a long time : in 1990 , many houses in the former GDR were occupied , among them almost the entire Main Street very close to the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer was cleared under great police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from around the world in recent years : residents from the GDR times and former house @-@ occup@@ ants now share their neighborhood .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be recognized by disc@@ arded pan@@ es or freshly painted fac@@ ades thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year as often as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crimin@@ ality : criminals such as body assault are according to statistics almost exclusively against polic@@ emen .
the most part of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tend to hit the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for violence , it is important : the 94 people are their neighbors , they are certainly not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer give it right in the old Riga .
for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is consciously pulled into the Riga street - and remained .
this is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media who all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July .
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new@@ buildings in former buildings , which disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here rather people are living here who are not so well bed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what to do if someone never li@@ stens to someone ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those drawn with color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
who draws near should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub district , can complain badly about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organisation .
she is also a social worker on site .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Agency for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the Administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , Working Group , Refu@@ ge@@ es , Administration , Auth@@ orities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here , the egg @-@ cutting Woll@@ me@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem .
this meant that some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job .
we were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an experienced Woll@@ me@@ ch@@ sau .
but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
she has limited a 50 percent job for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon new containers stand in the Was@@ en@@ straße
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ rats@@ amt to Commune and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it does not work so that one relies on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , common apartments must be in@@ timi@@ dated , as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be installed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and hel@@ pl@@ essness for refugees and migrants who need to be gro@@ unded or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive external impact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people would have to develop a feeling of belonging .
so it takes offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so also administration and volunteers jump here .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
they must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensi@@ bly , for example with language courses .
whoever develops the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there are also problem cases , says customer honestly , &quot; people where nothing goes wrong . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : did the two after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces fear ra@@ dic@@ alization , also in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some people call na@@ ï@@ ve &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ sed .
these incidents are also the subject of the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would completely re@@ vo@@ ke them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they want to show that they don &apos;t have anything to do with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers will have to look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they always have in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
to answer this question clearly is the policy .
actually it is unfair to put them on site hel@@ pers .
&quot; we haven &apos;t arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would un@@ wind the situation .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the certificates are already used to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way .
these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , both women are in agreement .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ary with helicop@@ ters looked for
