<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer was looking for a bit of change with a ride on the beach with some colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home in the fast gallop home to the feed-consoles.</seg>

<seg id="9">And that ended the equestrian career again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer from all times - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family through the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swear for photographic purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at the CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sporting aid handed over to the man from Anhausen, within the framework of a small gala, the Golden sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorlaurel, Champions-Tour-Player of the Year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen had already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="19">In Aachen, on Saturday he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been supporting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was admitted to the" "" "Hall of Fame of German Sports" "" "on Saturday." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">The performers include the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the former Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Bob-driver Meinhard Nehmer, der Judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum der Handballer Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">After the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza price was running.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clintons and Branch Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">To invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "" "" "however, the two US presidential candidates are not one in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are fundamentally underpinned by a more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">That, over the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will drive heavily back on regulations, and he is powering up a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and businesses." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has disadvantaged chances to open up and needs money for it." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would increase for the rich, she says.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton are almost worrying.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there might be partial discussions about drumming.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more obvious.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restore coal mining in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, it wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energies with its investment program and asks:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energy and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even when it comes to international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the Transpazilian trade agreement, do not want to sign.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - it simply wants to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better, for example, calls for Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says:" "" "the minimum wage has to be rushed," "" "he says, he must not be changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics follow him, so that the budget deficit could only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton is at least asking the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>

<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are Poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January, Condrobs created the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid Association.</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>

<seg id="24">"" "in women, other reasons outweigh the escape:" "" "many secretly steal from it because they see no other way out." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="30">Those who believe that the end, as soon as they are in Germany, is mistaken, tells Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="31">Here too, single women in refugee camps would often be regarded as inferior and at worst misused.</seg>

<seg id="37">In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">Some with no reply to the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction.</seg>
<seg id="39">In Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the accommodation of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">In Swabia alone, fleeting women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, the government spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="41">In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are floors in some common shelters or houses for single women and their children.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the Assistant Doctors have called on their union to approve new labour campaigning measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more labour campaigning measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC stated that there would have been ministers to address the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistant doctors and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">It was rejected by 58% of its members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "stubbornly quiet," which led to the refusal of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "In light of this, the JDC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official new negotiations on all your concerns." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In response to the silence of the government, the JDC Committee today issued a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running programme of escalating labour combat measures beginning in September.</seg>
<seg id="10">The disputes led to the fact that Assistant Doctors struck six times this year, the first complete failures in the history of the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="11">The director of the BMA resident doctors Dr. Johann Malawana came back after the election to reject the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">He shared BMA members during the meetings that were still held before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students that the contract should be beneficial and should be accepted.</seg>
<seg id="13">After the vote, the Minister of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors in England would be introduced compulsory.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "outsider" "" "alliance?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey came on Tuesday to give their hands and to announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny that Ankara would like this reconciliation the most.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile appeared slippery and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if there had never been anything bad.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed rather to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiant, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductions: the shot of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was aroused.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin condemned and accused Ankara of having fallen behind Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the cousins will be difficult, if not impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, state-controlled media led a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could make a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan first needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of almost his ministry last month in a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks against Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in VeDemsti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry at the West as it looks at the reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "to this end, the continued grudge about the EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won in Ankara a bonus that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit at this glittering palace on the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described to me: two countries that feel threatened and treated badly by the West and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role of peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they hadn't even touched the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences while Putin decided to stress them.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey fired up the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state are talking at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia's Putin firing Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Sergey Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV has been part of the closest council of confidence for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transportation matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is said that without giving reasons, Putin has ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been his deputy since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website it reads (in Russian) that he later was Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the staff.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "thank you for your trust." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activities as head of state regarding bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov was asked to leave his post and recommend Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has mysteriously intertwined Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergey Ivanov was a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidant, working as he did for the Soviet Intelligence Service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will resign at their own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the ridiculing for the cameras, few are convinced here - especially now, shortly before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as a potential president who once would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - reached great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - placable posts for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of office had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another nearby ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when you build Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">Overall, almost 79% of the deck's decks lie in their place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>

<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of the future-oriented high-rise and civil engineering.</seg>

<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeter south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, since the Viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs approx. 6000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens are saying," "" "Investors should be taken much more strongly in the future." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">How to react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,300 affordable apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "action concept for housing" at the next council session.</seg>
<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First of all, the question is: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation has been lacking so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D vice-president Christoph Bratmann writes:" "" "we agree with the Greens: if you want to build on urban areas, in future we will have to pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable housing can, however, also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big dispute in the town hall is," "" "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development program that will cost millions of dollars and is still to be financed is to provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, said Bratmann:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions right now." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make as few rules as possible for investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, violently violently, a tightening of the situation in the housing market is emerging.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you balance the loss of more than 1,300 inexpensive apartments, whose promotion will expire in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokesperson Nicole Palm, prospective bonds should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought of buying apartments back into the price bond.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke, the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the end of the year, Fristen will be running in the Weststadt.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be found there back to the price relationship for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the west is dramatically increased, the aim of the so-called thoroughness is removed.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged neighbourhoods in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness, worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Teenagers and children will no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring on screens, has been depleted by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">At first, the time on the screen was limited to the TV, then on video games and recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest in the release of the game decreased in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been postponed by massive demand that overburdened the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokemon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon, which are followed by a GPS, and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the turkey and jumped up for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the US, the game led to a considerable increase in increments that the average person recovers every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiff, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people, who train every day for 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes of time" "" "to" "" "come from the sofa" "" "and" "" "be active every day" "", "because many public messages on health are boring and coming from people that look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly exercise sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, which is too long to guide them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friends on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "" "" "as always, there are also grumpy playbacks, which always have to complain about something." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could run against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone apps like Fitbit earlier could track our activity, they gave us no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will diminish over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">However, based on poker's success, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="6">Effortless on the beam.</seg>
<seg id="7">Stunningly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant on the whole line.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now also the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast clinched the title of the competition on Thursday and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall result of 62.198 was clearly in front of the silver medal winner and Final Five team member Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The American woman Simone Biles performs on the Swedish bar during the single multi-campaign of women in the art gymnastics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-campaign title and overall the fifth while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey ended at that moment.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success represents them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Reson told her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She expected her last trial in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be regarded as disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace after they have won gold and silver in the single multi-campaign of women at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday,</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell party of retired man-ordinator Martha Karolyi served as exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Bilo insisted on having never planned the future during its long journey, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their soil exercises - including their typical tumbling - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium where Boorman exercised, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has lost no more competition, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even if Mustafina made easy walking through two turns, the picture was clouded.</seg>
<seg id="27">Balance beams and floor gymnastics - in which Bilo holds the world title - was listening.</seg>
<seg id="28">She resumed her work with 15,433 on the balance beam and sat on the floor with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman hugged her gently when she expected her grandson - a pure formality - and tears poured into glee gleaming red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision that she once described in her journal.</seg>

<seg id="31">"" "this time the 22-year-old team captain, named" "" "Oma" "", "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After their soil exercise, she threw down kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, who died in one of the deadliest attacks of Phoenix for a decade, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis subsidiary Maleah were shot on 12 June, while the car was parked in a driveway, said the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a hand-fired firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled to another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police said that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, since the attacker didn't take the handbags or the $2,900, who were in possession of one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in nine attacks in nine attacks, and two others were wounded within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," Howard of KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, announced at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspect used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to their injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which dragged on an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-times murder and that it was assumed that it was the work of the serial killer.</seg>

<seg id="1">Heavy rainfall, flooding gives cause for bailouts in Louisiana, Mississippi</seg>
<seg id="2">Heavy rainfalls and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the Governor to call on the emergency room on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="3">Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi overflooded their banks and threatened with large-scale flooding after extreme rainfalls, reported the National Weather Service.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards alleges that civil servants are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the move to the affected communities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness of the Governor, told us that the requests for flood-vehicles, boats and sand bags increased.</seg>
<seg id="6">Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa had requested tens of thousands of sand bags.</seg>
<seg id="7">A flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Louisiana to Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="8">The weather service announced that there could be additional 3 to 5 inches of rain in this area.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the south of Alabama a flood warning system was used on Friday while it was still raining in the mobile area.</seg>
<seg id="10">The River Comites near Baton Rouges and the River Amite near Denham Springs, both of which are located in Louisiana, will probably reach record levels over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="11">The metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flood many houses near Baton Rouge.</seg>
<seg id="12">He also said that a flow-downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these rivers will only slowly flow into Lake Maurepas via the trodden rivers.</seg>
<seg id="13">The river Tickfaw, south of the Mississippi River border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 09.00, which was ever recorded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rescue teams still plucked people out of flood water in the borough Amite and Wilkinson in the south-west of Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="15">Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those who were saved on Friday near Gloster.</seg>
<seg id="16">Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house, increased overnight.</seg>
<seg id="17">He said he had warned him of another son who lives nearby.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "we woke up and the water streamed and flowed in," "" "said Hansford." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">It reached my waist.</seg>
<seg id="20">His wife Hansford said she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there.</seg>
<seg id="21">Hansford said he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.</seg>
<seg id="22">Hansford said that Nothelfer escaped all three in a large military truck and would have brought them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were stationed until Friday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Krautmann said that the flooding had" "" "spread quickly" "", "as there were still heavy rainfalls and that the authorities considered evacuation instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Krautmann, an observer contacted Livingstone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.75 inches of rain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Krautmann said that the soil has been considerably sucked by the rainfalls since Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="26">The authorities stated that heavy rainfall and street flooding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and in five boroughs.</seg>
<seg id="27">The CBS subsidiary WWL reported that a subsidiary in Tangipahoa attacked 200 flooded houses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches which were now flooded.</seg>
<seg id="29">The ruler of the community of Robby Miller said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets who were washed up by the floods.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the cities of Amite and Hammond, emergency shelters were set up to house the evacuation.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "as soon as the water starts to go back, they will be able to return to their homes," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen roads were closed because of the flood and sand bags were provided for the residents to take part, which hope to be able to keep the water out of their houses and shops.</seg>
<seg id="33">"the last big flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum from the city administration.</seg>
<seg id="34">This seems to be a similar incident.</seg>
<seg id="35">In Mississippi, the emergency manager Rupert Lacy of Harrison Countys said it was still raining on the Gulf Coast.</seg>
<seg id="36">According to his information, a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooding, but on Friday they have not been reported.</seg>
<seg id="37">Keith Townson, manager of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.</seg>
<seg id="38">"I have seen water in places I've never seen before," said Townson, "and it's still coming."</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">This is what I imagine taking part in the Women's Olympiad in gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been part of every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin colors.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess and Madison Kocian, who is catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one female female gymnast was an Afro-American woman.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympiawinner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three times world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected, yet masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the peak of this kind of sport, but it does not look like gymnastics across the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">They are the "Last Five," because the next Olympic team will only have four female gymnasts in the team.</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics is a costly sport and Turner primarily comes into private sports clubs which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families). the list can be continued arbitrarily.</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in affluent suburbs that can support business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs the Turner will get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started with gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to draw the communities out of innumerable, young girls, inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, providing a more affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my turnaround 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events, we have offered free and affordable Turns in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my home town) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport and to profit.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health and schooling and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team, bringing thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" through the Holen of the Olympic team square and thank you for getting so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 assistant doctors voted in favour of a vote rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt plans to introduce the Treaty by way of compulsion and said that the NHS found itself in a "No Man Land" and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistance physicians will receive a new contract containing changes to night and weekend supplements to improve the maintenance of unscheduled watchmaking.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee on Assistance, announced last night in a message: "assistance physicians have still raised serious concerns about the proposed deal, in particular that it will fuel the current financial crisis and will meet all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">In only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract, progress has to be made and the time will expire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve the dispute by dialogue caused the government to participate in opposition and sometimes on a deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This was done by a promise that Jeremy Hunt had just made last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the vibration and address the concerns of the assistance physicians." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do this, the Assistant Doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the Streikpost chain cover.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the Reformed Treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA wants a better weekday pay for the 54.000 Assistance Physicians subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS employees, called on the assistance doctors to stop the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Mortimer said:" "" "working conditions achieve nothing that only little, but have already overloaded teams and service providers and prepare for the patients, nursing staff and their families only worries, need and interruption." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Assistance Physicians and responded positively with the Ministry of Health and other ministries with regard to guardianship and whistleblowing.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hope that continuing positive engagement on other important topics - such as posting, flexibility in training, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and gender-specific wage differential in medicine - were a sign of how serious it were the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the BMA agreements in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="2">Thousands of heart attacks will benefit from a £2-per day drug, recommended by the authorities to administer this more people for a longer period of time.</seg>
<seg id="3">The anticoagulant medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">The medication is administered after a heart attack for 12 months, reducing the risk of a stroke or another heart attack.</seg>

<seg id="6">NICE's regulatory authority, NICE, recommended a four-year-long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of them suffer a further heart attack or a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that stops the blood flow to the heart and causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolve, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more likely.</seg>
<seg id="13">NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack suffer from a heart attack or a stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from this.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities ignorantly ignoring a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidence of election abuse due to" "" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister for Integration and Local Government, now an anti-corruption regime, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut-off bands outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "he recommends that voters should consult with them to prove their identity in elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter must merely name his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply a non-removable ink on the finger of a person if they release their vote to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by unofficial committees or working groups." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this serves not only against electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that is associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a consequence of the Tower Hamlets Choice Channel in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Luton Rahman, should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "Rahman said," "" "Let his campaign be on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses to be someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence for fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">In particular, he voiced alarm about the fraudulent choice of letters - when the older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">Sir Eric, shown, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including conducting expressions to prove identity</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report it states: "as evidence, it was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exerted, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the older, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there were concerns that state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior because of" "" "politically correct" "" "hypersensitivities concerning ethnicity and religion." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition that political activists work letterdial documents to stop "election harvests."</seg>

<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go alone to the electoral cab.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing," that the Tower Hamlets didn't show a complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "the Electoral Court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unsuitable," "" "he said." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">How to protect yourself from weapons attacks with Krav Maga</seg>
<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com might make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you approach you from the front or back, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you get closer to you from behind, then you should turn around as first so you can see your attacker and "go out of the line," Mizrachi says.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Strike him with his knee in the lath and twist, while the aggressor gets clasped from pain, the weapon out of his hands. strike him with the barrel into the face and move backwards while throwing the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">At the same time shift the weight to the weapon and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>
<seg id="11">Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi is doing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright shabt for a travel guide his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller underwent a serious examination by a British traveller, by leaning on some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk abated his train on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a pull toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before leaking every object he used a Luminometer to show himself and to show us what he is going to get involved.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed in the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results.</seg>
<seg id="6">The thought to lick up the rinsing button of a pull toilet used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately, nothing left him, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public railroads to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task turned out to be a sample of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said:" "" "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, soil, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test swab showed a luminous number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that, the luminous number of fresh washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their luminous number was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "that comes close to the worst thing I've smelled in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't want to lick here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Valios senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We waged crazy brainstorming, who ended up saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say that - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I ordered him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we've recorded some of these dirty treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that at least they occasionally use products containing included lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left its housing after a delogization of £50,000, because it had terrorized its neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Treviscock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found property in an irreparable condition.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls showed gaping holes, wood boards were torn, garbage was dispersed on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that they are now living in a private accomodation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think that people don't have to live in that way." ""</seg>

<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive shouting, strings and floods.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an arrangement for antisocial behaviour in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they had to fight them on the street and had to be called regularly to the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delogierte her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogization was cheered by lightened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that the family would have had to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">Trash and old toys were thrown down on the overgrown side of the church building.</seg>
<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant would refuse to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as a delogizing is always the last step into consideration Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will provide comfort to some neighbors and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">In 2021, the country's election will not take place again at the end of the summer holidays, the Schweriner Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="5">For stupid as far it is not possible: summer holidays, heat and land election campaign - that bites itself.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who want to be convinced by the campaign fighters, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Ruegen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so may not choose the land tag.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: in the holidays helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count on the end votes are difficult to drive up.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern again has to pass through election campaign to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, Leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalitionalism.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive campaigning, one sees from his big posters." ""</seg>

<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create that" "" "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make election campaigns at the right time at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited German Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's parliamentary election circle is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary-General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel once.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost-CDU largely eliminates the usual campaign conditions on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, according to Kokert, plays only a" "" "minor role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union also noted that in the country you are crumbling the basis that it has to be very tough to find a wire to the people again." ""</seg>

<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU militant Kokert to his fellow combatants is also self-exposing: "you have to go where it hurts, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is at stake, Sellering has called his SPD into a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the S & D Group was at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just in front of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election in 2011, the SPD had still clearly gained 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "the Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the country's day." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue of holiday hardship and largely lay their election campaign largely on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "", "it calls the country president Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green campaigners embark on a search for traces of local voters among holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curvt just with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even nice.</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 Renovation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is refurbished.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which begin at 5.30 a.m. and end up at 8 o'clock in the morning, there are praise everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station.</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay either.</seg>
<seg id="7">The construction site was scheduled to be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, and everything will be ready by the end of October.</seg>
<seg id="8">The commencement of the work of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of residential buildings.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg is back, the traffic situation within the place has relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now sail from Ofterdingen from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The evasive traffic through the village seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were sometimes considerable complaints," says Florian King, responsible for the management of the rehabilitation department of the rehabilitation department.</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bachstraße, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schleichdistances searched and more familiar to their navigation device than the signage.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some truck drivers franking in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality was demanding an increase in the Mössingen test vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant transgressions," says King, who informed himself about the situation himself.</seg>
<seg id="17">There have been two to three per minute.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 km / h in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">Since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales incubation with them, everyone you ask is perplexed.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "those who have less to do with the" "" "end customer" "" "are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences." ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "maximum slight decline" "" "in the dealership of Maier, but also acknowledges that" "" "the mileage is missing" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most powerful are the restaurants along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words.</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "not only him, but all the restaurants" "" "hit hard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the revenue losses are reduced to" "" "far above 50 percent" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "the street renovation has" "" "thrown back" "" "its operation" "" "two years ago." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to dismiss half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, President Jörg Schmidt insisted on a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the location on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties, where so much more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all complaints, Göhner is sure his restaurant will continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been here since 1715 and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">He can understand that other regular guests are less often looking past due to complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't go down, it is also nice somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubt that his stem clide returns to the end of the redevelopment work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner keeps the effects of the B 27 works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, this is already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="22">At dolls for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than previously - such as those who commit crimes or throw their papers away deliberately to obscure their identity.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of these are politically and legally sanctioned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some work also seems to be unchecked and leaves questions to be answered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And with some points - in the unequal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises: what does this really have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects refugees and terror.</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "in addition, many people were worried about safety in the face of the high numbers of refugees." ""</seg>

<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to present a sales increase from January to July.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men of middle-aged love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">This statement is derived from current data before proceeding to the commentary section, in order to conceal it under the pseudonym Non-Alleename man's middle-aged man.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the reformation of gramophone records is not booming to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to the midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional impact: older record buyers keep their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and stuffed up before I stop, hold my hands and say something better than: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill up the buildings in which once independent salesmen were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialty shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and sentiment through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he has such a sizeable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford than they appeared and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was probably a bit too young to buy them," he says.</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink too much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets may apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media crowd, people who heard about the comeback and decided to buy their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I have conducted, people usually got rid of their collection so around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to fans of the record holder of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to revert to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects that call happy memories of rejoicing.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be a emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get involved spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "an employee floats from a sheet pile." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not have record players.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while I am smoother through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here recently and said," "" "I don't have a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead acoustic record to put them on the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More product-saving, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying," "" "I don't have record players." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older people who come in slowly.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage girls and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest Synthesizer- and sexually-packed pop in place of experimental jazz booms from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks odd, but the psychological trauma is hard to detach when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around in the business for a few minutes and looks at the variety of plates available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't deserve much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to hear music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is... "it drives off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I give the impression that jeans pants are stuffed, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping themselves around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter think about buying a Crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and could send some customers to the depths Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research showed that the results of YouGov are right, they do not take into account the large number of female collectors in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their thursday morning with security not with bumblebees from Berwick Street and sheets through plates, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who raises nothing of middle-aged men over the shoulders.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary deals in which persons within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which hold a risk of fire and sanity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also explained that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people conducting the 72 Provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-7 Rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji has given a master class in handling, side-stitching, retrofitting, line running and roher strength to win gold - her first Olympic Medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was lost due to the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The considerable defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But independently of this, Fiji could have beaten a 15-man team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - that at least one Brite will have a gold medal for his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, under Ryan they lost any game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they only lose one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This cap will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji started wonderful and caused the attacks of GBs to bounce off.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. an, as if you were running into running buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 as Osea Kolinisau stood in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With four minutes of playing, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A sleeker Tackle from Mitchell stopped the Mount of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to get a third gate, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua left a Touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for the UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the rep and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presumes through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB is still learning.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB brought basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua crossed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay by Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton launched an attempt for the UK, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went long in favor of the South Sea Sulans, whose fans swore, flags wave and danced on the tribune.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliamo made the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounds, the Fijis embraced himself and GB kicked out crunched into the lawn.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain forced South Africa in a tight semi-finalmatch from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown brought the Boks in the first half forward, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, brother Anthony of the English 15-Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired by the fight with the trainer's cancer</seg>
<seg id="2">There will be no emotless gold than with these games and that will mean something.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first rudder-stroke to the last, 220 hard Hieve, which go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning invented an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even if only the two were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams was all present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in a row without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport who used such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolute, after all their 39th unerring deployment, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant female athletes, gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph to goose.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in the oars there is a battalion of willing helpers who make up the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no better than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer, which is operable and that did it.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty terrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if it was the right term in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to go better soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts came to Williams, who spent a nerve-ering morning with something more than usual and tried to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, who was a captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's maybe something extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I have worked for, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>
<seg id="23">It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">Without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you goes to him. he is the best trainer in the world.</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or to have a better coach.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the past five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close up, panning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>

<seg id="5">Some time ago in the original sound, it was said to be part of the Bayerischer Rundfunk's contribution.</seg>
<seg id="6">Little later, the water forum of the Government of Lower Franconia honored the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group was" "" "bayernised as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the team of employees, 28 of them as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually supports about 150,000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and hamlet with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are Kirchberg, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts exist for further towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current Chairman, Widbrunner Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert joined Göller in 1985 as a water attendant and was appointed Managing Director of the Inner Association in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisation activities, budgetary planning, calculation of fees and contributions up to emergency missions on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event, it called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation of farmers, the renovation of the elevated tank (1999), the acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the renewal of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no standstill and I have always added innovations, because water means life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In their laudation Göllers praised the faithful, reliable and correct service over the past 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has used a lot of heart blood for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitensteingruppe on nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia district.</seg>
<seg id="20">For this he received a great deal of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, for his part, praised Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterman and he was a faithful pop-man.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As a highlight from his point of view he described the construction of the well and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">The biggest challenge and the most difficult task however were the rupture of the tubular at the church louder on a third of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of Neubrunn can only be maintained because one filled the elevated tank of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water utility association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter who will succeed Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-shaken and energy-intensive German steel industry remains spared by additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity subsidies are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">It remains with the release of the Renewable Energy Reform in the existing plants for so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations tough after two years." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for generating electricity for their own consumption.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to German industry association, the steel industry costs an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissary Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills is an EEG levy of 20 percent.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">In this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely ascertained.</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>

<seg id="16">"" "" "" "also in the reform of the emission rights trade, climate and employment targets are to be weighed," "" "said IG Metall head Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation increased further, when the world's largest producer country China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers submit price dumping to Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has eased a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, tracked import duties on imported steel have an impact, on the other hand economic prospects in China have emerged.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price pick-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have been more stagnant.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end, ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the German steel industry, around 86000 people were employed at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the year-earlier month, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short increase in May, the quantity produced went back the second month consecutively.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in emissions.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, mind, health: singing makes seniors good</seg>
<seg id="2">Ursel Kipp has already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she reserved the subject music in the teacher's course, and today the 78 year old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me emotionally and physically," she says.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">For Singen is a great hobby for seniors from a number of perspectives, Erhard Hackler says from the German seniors division.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most seniors sing in the chorus and share with like-minded people the joy of music, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings, senior citizens can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be tiring in a positive sense, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">In doing so, senior citizens exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who demand their lungs regularly, do not get out of the puste in everyday life as well.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to keeping the sound of the voice at age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">For older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of the Seniors Organizations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations, the common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs arouses many memories, often connected with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and especially melodies reflect people who have fallen ill in long-standing events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time to focus on one's own voice and to a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - that's a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Even older people who live alone do not only focus on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition given by singing in the choir, Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try out a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when a tone comes next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone from the acquaintances sings in a senior choir, one can easily connect.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or church leaders.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help in the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have studied in Hanover what effect the hops of kittens have on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To her surprise, the mistrust did not leave the males cold - however, they always behaved the same in contrast to the females.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of pathogen of kittens on the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous examination, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens were different with the urgency of their neediness.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight female cats were observed from the husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a call of little ones, who were taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from the mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with screaming of more strongly aroused kittens, who were raised in addition.</seg>
<seg id="13">Despite the small sample, the researchers keep their results meaningful.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all the females, even those who had no offspring yet, responded to the screams," said Conerding.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned out faster to the speaker when this reputment of the very softer kittens played.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may possibly be congenital or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males were reacting at all," said the biologist.</seg>
<seg id="18">In the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans.</seg>

<seg id="22">On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid.</seg>

<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police ordered their officials throughout the country to reinforce security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>

<seg id="33">This gives the military a great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta Chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, improving economic situation and tourism.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympics or world records set the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">In the Aquatics Center the slightly overweighted swimmer of Ethiopia came so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.</seg>

<seg id="6">In social networks, Habte was then become a viral internethite.</seg>
<seg id="7">In fact, the 24-year-old finished his first race with a 48 second back and finished the 59th position of 59 starts.</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just athletic figure attracting the attention of the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why should the 24-year-old participate in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start-up right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries more familiar.</seg>
<seg id="12">As most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.</seg>

<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">Eric Moussambani received media attention during the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney.</seg>

<seg id="1">As of October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre wastewater will take place from 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welshahl 3,44 instead of previously 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the installation in Azendorf the wastewater charge will be increased at the latest if necessary improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After an oversluggish calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the district council Kulmbach, it was established that undercover was used for these sewage installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal bases, the Kasbah market is obliged to operate the systems in a cost-effective manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016, citizens as well as commercial and industrial companies from Welshahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to go deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As head of management Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious fee increases by providing relatively small installations with a very low sewage plant, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Thus, due to the small deployment, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">As a result of their age, refurbishment and repair expenses were to a considerable extent not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for the Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp are almost 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system in the wastewater treatment plant in Azendorf had to be replaced by a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station of Welshahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground and after almost 20 years of operation the first sewage system had to be removed, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation system had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued care and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which are still below the current level in the previous calculations in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "stone houses made it clear that in the three plants, the expenses for the operation and maintenance were" "" "fully integrated" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="20">In the process, Schmidt added that the market community of large entertainment costs remained spared in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the above-mentioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the long run, especially as the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater treatment association can not be extended by these systems, because they are deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect criticized as an Asian caricature</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million everyday users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are immaculate, self-propelled tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All misinterpretations are transmitted to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting Blackface promotion or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week proposed a filter to some users, who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and jerked cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat announced that it turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who experienced racism reminded the filter of breaking clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Casapani, a Korean-American art student, whose tweets were widespread over the photos, wrote that the filter was "hurting and the thread was said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "she added that" "" "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very disgusting Asian caricature and filter effects." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face was drawn into the descending extremity.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural stumbling set.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats large audience of young people - who are more diverse in race than their older counterparts - might expect more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">When one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things go unnoticed than it was before," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the recruitment practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu also criticized the large part of white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce, so that they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there, but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of his employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently set up a HR manager focusing on inter-represented population groups and internal integration efforts.</seg>

<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the Army Committees, Secret Service Committees and the Army Commitment Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command intelligence agencies who reported how supervisors changed their assessments on American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>

<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," said Ken Calvert, a republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the Centcom range to the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The 10-page report shows permanent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence suggesting government leaders under Obama's instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced pressure from their hierarchies to draw a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command testimonials, statements and statements before the Congress were much more positive than facts." "" "the report noted." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a Centcom party publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, it's so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Congressmen from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to mid-2015, the leaders of Central Command changed intelligence reports to put down the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to live after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by more detailed knowledge, while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are under way by the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="18">On Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created an overly limited trial for the creation of intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-level democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process," "" "Mr. Schiff said," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "said the moral among analysts and" "" "there was too little room for divergent opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of finding the White House interfering with the Centcom analysts with regard to a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by" "" "The Daily Beast" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's general inspector, who were taken up by Centcom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense did not comment on reports of the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence agencies and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful campaign of air under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an allegation made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">However, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honorable assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document on how the then government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupation force in Iraq and did little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion against the current reporting about the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team confirmed that contrary to the government's statements against the refineries held by the Islamic State, there was no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries were commissioned to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">However, this knowledge was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger Commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his excessive positive appraisal of the war situation during a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced at the Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after having shot three doors during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember this ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know that the American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons at first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Great Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take the strong Dutch some longer out of the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game starts on Saturday, American women have triggered a surprising whirl through their success story, four years after they ended up in the last London games on the last of 12 seats.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years in hands (her two older sisters played sports at Drexel University), at 16 years she became a national player in the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics because she couldn't qualify for the Kader.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>

<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the rudder altogether.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a backstroke from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India had entered the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and knocked the ball into the goal to get a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, as late it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly feeling and inescapably, a rapid relay race between competition and striving.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow to the swimmer to the athlete to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympics, and a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV ads, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not highlight every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have a modest argument for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it became so sparse that many of the things I had questioned did not know that it is at all an Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in jumping on trampolines and has had an athlete up to 2012 who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadian women for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has some outsider's charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsschule than that sounds for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports which essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Aspiring champions jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "according to official Olympic programme, they are rated according to version, degree of difficulty and" "" "flight time" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists have to go further, faster, up and down in their quest for gold, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and down, up and down at the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They don't just chase the finish line or the starting wall, but also a further highlight in television transmission: the world or the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to even stir up a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel fatiguing myself when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The Vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly up.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final hours of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; that of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will broadcast the final hours as part of a afternoon block from 2 p.m. onwards.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of the Olympic Mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the fear and objecting of male athletes - as the male US Turner recently proposed according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protests in Ethiopia, Long An ally of the United States</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who call for political change in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that, during the clashes with the police, tens of thousands of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopian right to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political change.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was relentless according to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police fired and killed tens of thousands of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">Videos being circulated about the protests, probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Agency now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group.</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and secret services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist attacks beyond the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you suppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Seewm Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The whole youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from soil usage to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely-criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, the tensions continue along the Eritrea border; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which have been forced more or less during the last years, could benefit from the turbulence and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, because cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government locks the access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially among protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were so protesting.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Ampersias, who come from Ethiopia's mainly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowlands.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are to co-ordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Ampersias and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, until his death on a not-publicized illness in 2012 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this basic skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an upheaval in 2005, after thousands of polls protested, apparently deceived by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed even if it was less than in recent months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal abuse of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And she assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month, protesters in Gondar, an amperic city, led businesses from Tigray and hate against the Tigray becomes more and more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests spread the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighbouring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin balancing act." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his statement Obama had founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump, on Friday, tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by anging that his multiple-repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton, would have been the "founder" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification created new questions on the communication skills of Republican Republican candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings about his fellow campaigners who endeavour to take him in protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position to explain the statements he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After he had made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump recalled the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out, the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day Mr. Trump told in a number of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomoderator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism unleashes Mr. Trump, while he has tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling surveys.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he said, "Of course, I said," Of course, sarcastically. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also believe he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even etched note, as his demand values have gone further.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with a huge margin in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while reinforcing the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze have brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, made a big effort to defend the candidate today in a Thursday CNN interview.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr. Giuliani complained about Mr. Trump's statement about whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it Hinterbängler, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to spread out by forcing it to take control of the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the PA election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Trump took off his attacks on the media and accused them of carrying around each of his words and being taken against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "TV experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as a further proof that he was unfit for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shredded café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which didn't have Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices of his Bedford Avenue store front were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "the" "" "Soap Cherie" "" "business, replacing Verb in summer 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people claimed it as the last loss in a city-ridden city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempted and Verb now is a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, it is also new invention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A re-animated Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing associate of the old coffee shop, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered to provide money for a new outdoor table, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>
<seg id="14">Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same bulbs from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish like capers and sauerkraut.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are nature dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.</seg>
<seg id="24">Recently at a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>
<seg id="25">Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg in former times and visited the verb regularly.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after she had moved to Greenpoint, she would take the path.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the verb had closed, she gave up coffee drinking for a while, she said.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was clear to me that it was the coffee and the culture that I liked," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended Chai Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been a long-standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Verb in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "" "" "I came quarters after seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Everything Bagel with butter," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and pick up new ingredients in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="34">Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his Everything-Bagel with bacon, egg and cheese.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a delicacy, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland's terrapin soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and as dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brickyard was told in her book "97 Orchard" about living in a residential building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">Their latest collaboration, "An decent meal," which will be published on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, non-local snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the crash of 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brickman, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable dishes.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter hacked minced, this took place the couple for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," Brickman said.</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap, which stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as a dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have been like lead in the stomach," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cook for male fellows and it was served freshly baked pastas for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "a Square Meal" traces the ways in which the country was surrounded not to be the land of largenland.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when food was a central, tense issue for Americans," "" "committed Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was equally tense: mysterious food like bread and saucepans became staple food, the casserolle as a "wonderful way to recycle food leftovers," said Ziegelman, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dry fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rarely serviced luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Unique blends have been tried out since a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction has primacy over taste or even healthy cooking.</seg>
<seg id="27">During their research for the book, which includes recipes, Brickman prepared a dish from this period, fried onions with peanut butter.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "" "" "it was not a popular addition at lunch," "" "says Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "brickmann continues:" "" "it was surreal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the domestic business recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">As never before or since, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - exaggerated the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "housekeepers" and the challenge to transform pamphlets like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "a Square Meal" "" "is a celebration of historic delicacies." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">In particular, the reports on the response of the government to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me-cake-eating attitude, are particularly tasty.</seg>
<seg id="36">While he openly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he spoke like the millionth man of the world he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gold-plated dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt would probably have committed the same mistake if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the present of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roosevelt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most controversial. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the types of the Great Depression Era to deal with food became discarded as soon as the country came back to the legs.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, said Brickman, as well as how science was applied to foods.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple tried to better understand the eating habits of brickman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how they could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she was afraid of the waste of food," "" "said Coe." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "brickman remembered:" "" "she actually made people ill." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was the case of the wind.</seg>
<seg id="48">After the plate at Eisenberg's was cleared, they and Coe prepared a dessert that they had prepared at home: the Pflaumeneutical, which served President Roosevelt at lunch.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "it's called Prune Whip," "" "said Brickman, adding that it was a common ploy to miss a nice name." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone turned a bit reluctantly a spoon in the tamed, brown Glibber.</seg>
<seg id="52">Amazingly, it tasted not bad.</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland shark usually only comes to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This Hai was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland shark only receives offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is average just 1,220 metres far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters is the five-meter long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle influenced by slowness seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "in any case of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness" "", "Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock comments this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist probably guessed that Greenland's hair became stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland shark is difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their slow speed was when they outfitted six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Loot nevertheless make this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and seek cadaver, which torches from higher water-layers downward.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Grönlandsharks, who caught fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest Hai was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetre measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lenticular nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens arises already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lentil nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth was therefore likely to lie in the early 1960s, when a search for a nuclear proliferation of nuclear weapons threw larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with a length of 220 centimetres, the lenticular nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All major Greenland shark, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 volumes in their lentils, resulting from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres is even 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers have been able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland shark with the multiplication obviously makes at least one and a half centuries time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methotalemes live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon on the neck was plugged into a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flaming fire.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal gives heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much bigger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," "" "explains the evolutionist biologist Scheuerlein." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal, on the other hand, should invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="4">During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the property selection list.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be invoked directly from the hotel room.</seg>
<seg id="6">How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel has been eliminated and deleted?</seg>
<seg id="7">Wrote Lanzmann.</seg>
<seg id="8">Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center.</seg>

<seg id="10">"" "the answer he received there," "" "sent him" "" "as Lanzmann wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "the hotel staff said that the measure was a" "" "deliberate decision of the Kempinski Hotel management." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="14">"" "the Israeli ambassador in Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a" "" "great disgrace" "", "reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">We were appalled and dismayed by this event.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is really very shameful.</seg>
<seg id="17">The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even bigger disgrace.</seg>
<seg id="18">This does not require any explanation.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "we expect the hotel to" "" "draw the right conclusions," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">The incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet where people called it scandalous.</seg>
<seg id="21">Some were subordinating to the Kempinski Hotel that it would have indulged in the alleged reforestation of Arab guests. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "be ashamed," "" "said it in a different article, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is in the vicinity of a synagogue." ""</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministrants from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna travelled to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Together, four phases were mastered.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time to the next Romance journey of all ministrants in two years, the Oberministrantenberg St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various places of pilgrimage have been tried and one finally decided for the Bishops City of Freiburg, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrim's destination was offered for the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 And Minis of Bittelbronn, and Greol, and Haigerloch, and Heiligenstadt went on the way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, the priest sent out the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage, and blessed the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">From Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where a Muenster Unserer loved woman was standing and so the pilgrim departed from Münster.</seg>
<seg id="9">The individual tours were framed in the morning and evening, depending on a brief impulse, with different prayers, songs and written texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way the Minis repeatedly made a break at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from specially assembled pilgrims' booklet.</seg>
<seg id="11">For the nights, each parish church of the local parishes was available.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage destinations Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller created a tasty and starchy dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the second day we went on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day we took the stage to St. Peter, which was the most exhausting route, but at first the heat had to be covered by some 500 metres altitude and then climbed again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The earned reward was a joint barbecue at the bathroom feast in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in St. Peter's imposing monastery church, we went to Freiburg on the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Minis was visibly relieved and happy at the later afternoon at the Freiburg Cathedral and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse, God was thanked here.</seg>
<seg id="19">In the evening mass in Münster, Minis was welcomed by Kooperator Markus Obert.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the metropolis of Breisgau.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went by train back to Horb.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scottish Callum Skinner raced last night in the men's team Sprint in Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made to Eigen. he was proud of the legend when he stormed his home to win a victory of the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place at the World Championships in London in March, despite the entrance of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the starter Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a warning.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoy's retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hinder, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner scored a olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">Hinder was slightly back after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner stopped.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation from which Hinder drove in a higher gear, to slow down it and allow Kenny and foremost Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hinder as they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic Port in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the 2012 triumph on the Kenny's and Hoys page, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he deliberately dropped onto the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no appeal of England's rival.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Hinder said," "" "It feels like all the UK flags on the tribune like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We joined our team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We have come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation winning seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form Kenny, it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's win of three Olympic gold medals in a contest.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would mean Kenny - who was just 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (apparently holy date for British sports; on the day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equivalent to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hinder said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London 2012, was at 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">Yesterday he had fought with the officers before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition that will be continued tomorrow and finished, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK Team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a medal of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">There was drama in the background, with Shane Sutton's resignation in April in the midst of sexism and bullying charges as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations - are at stake, as the plant operator cancels the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, as the supplying energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision at the beginning of this year, not to award any further subsidies for the operation of the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy laid down for 20 years runs out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the system of Alcoa in Portland stand on the game.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk during closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects since the melting plant consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation Victorias.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry Melting mill, which led to closure of the Anglesea power station last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the long-term speculations regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting shop with its Loy Yang A power station in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, from which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means another physical demand for electricity by smelting," "" "announced the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "AGL continued to say that the contracts were" "" "hedging transactions" "" "that should come into effect from November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period, so they will end in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="20">The US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which should have entered into force from November this year, even if there is still an explanation why it resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Due to the poor economic conditions of the industry, analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the sought after September issue of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote.</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), a critical reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn) as well as in the presence of the most popular show biz uncle and producers of keeping Up Ryan Seacre: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the cliché of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon channelling at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to somehow participate in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has begun.</seg>
<seg id="8">Kendall's big sister Kim likes to have smitten the Vogue cover (she and her husband kanye West were to be seen on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is for Vogue the most sold issue of the year.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that rather resembles an image tape as a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (aut fashionista were advertisement from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover-star is expected so longingly that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine seep through the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "in recent years there have been clearly more" "" "celebrities" "" "as" "" "models that are celebrities" "" "on the cover." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar prize-winner and Dior-brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover for 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "" "breakthrough model" "" "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true for Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had with the publication of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenners's success doesn't like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the world of fashion has always been a bit tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the mistlets of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings cooked up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But to walk around on the misfortune seems to pass by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters sell images of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her pictures from Cindy Crawfords daughter to the magazine LOVE.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - the maker experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.</seg>

<seg id="9">The Nokia 9000 Communicator came to business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone.</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the InterNet Tournament.</seg>

<seg id="14">Even accessing websites was possible via HTML browsers, albeit slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Very proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. approximately 1400 euro.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody could suspect in August 1996 that the Communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story, even if not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="3">For me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">For our local communities, we will alone have 10,000 new teachers, 40,000 new jobs, and youth unemployment in the airport environment end.</seg>

<seg id="3">On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blogging on its desktop site, Adblock Plus published a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block again ads in the social network.</seg>

<seg id="4">The incident occured on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">A woman lay in the dark "in an act of despair" on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies from NASA developed a model to detect the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have heralded similar conditions with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protect from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exposed its day-side of the sun almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result are average temperatures, some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, resembling evolution previously suspected of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light over the course of several billion years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was burned away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">When their hydro-gen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect - Venus, which we know today.</seg>

<seg id="2">The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the Pleiades.</seg>
<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate to different rates as well as in what connection the rotation time periods are with planet creation.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">At peak-rotation-rates, these ripening stars repel large amounts of starches.</seg>
<seg id="9">As these winds travel through the magnetosphere of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.</seg>
<seg id="10">When a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.</seg>
<seg id="11">Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star patch -- like sunspots --.</seg>
<seg id="12">The latest catalogue of rotational rates suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rebull compares the stars with dancers, with bigger stars rotating more slowly pirouettes than smaller ones.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the Pleiades Ballet, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull.</seg>
<seg id="15">As the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotational rates.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the star cluster of the Pleiades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," said Rebull.</seg>

<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-meter obstacle-runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the critically acclaimed athletics competitions this news came about.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has been demonstrated last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had the fourth place in the finals over 100 m of butterflies, only about 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the events of more than 50 m Freestyle.</seg>

<seg id="13">For the first time in history the IOC is no longer the IOC, but the CAS responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news leaked out about the positive sample of Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive.</seg>
<seg id="15">"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," said the Bulgarian TV station BNT.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she was innocent," "" "the only explanation could be nutritional supplements," "" "said the athletic lady." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to be the blood doping agent EPO in the forbidden substance.</seg>
<seg id="18">Gdanekova was suspended for the time being, according to BNT, the B-sample should have been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Bojko Borisov reported immediately with criticism of the bulletin.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="23">Both of them deny the intake, but they are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the athletes start, the Danekova case is another serious blow for the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association had prohibited the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, also the LäuferNation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, in swimming sports, the former departures in China also ensured violent confrontations between the athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang Harsch.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: so perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware currently attack targeted companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware protection specialist, Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, accounted for 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months at least once, several times the victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to be able to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations of Malwarebytes, the perpetrators are specialising in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potential to be raised will be significantly higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">It was not until the end of the month that private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was terribly fast in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently modified files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the Ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the encryption key to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin -.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database at stake, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production stops.</seg>
<seg id="17">The damage is correspondingly higher if a ransomware strikes.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of German companies reported exchange losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business operation, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have been victims of attacks, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of cataracts.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims:" "" "don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">However, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay receive their data again.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in view of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, F-Secure safety researchers investigated the user's surface area and contact with the blackmailers and came to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their casualties via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt free sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And, after payment of a few hundred euros, individuals will be redeemed, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts in order to get their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware blackmail the hackers become more and more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the Cloud Drive provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware roughly within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware in the form of a software building kit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The existing malware kits have been created by using the Malware themselves, consulting and additional tools for a one-off, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackers then look for further hackers in order to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service economy.</seg>
<seg id="34">So you log in one of the forums on the ground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payments are made per certified calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then instruct spammers with the dissemination," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better safeguard their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey are confident that Ransomware can be able to repel Ransomware by means of file-back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful testing alone, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">Depending on the type of data, the potential for damage is much higher than before.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also target completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked central heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the perpetrators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future, Ransomware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="1">One for all cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear, it does not work closely at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well-crafted and have a pleasant effect, only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l for raised and 1026 l backrests, but there is the Magic Seats.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the ground to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the load height with 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide rev ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he should do his work somewhat more quietly.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Another engine is available: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The security systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed control reacts to the traffic sign detection and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity is available only for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and an HDMI jack are under the armrest and are therefore somewhat awkward to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 Euro, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="27">The engines comply with Euro 6 emission standards.</seg>

<seg id="1">Better traffic flow on the freeway feeder</seg>
<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass - here's a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the legal remedy should be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is good news for all cars, who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jams, when they drive over the motorway (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">On the coming Tuesday and Wednesday (16-17 August), the road construction company extends the right-hand bend in the area between the Hammer Street and the exit Weseler Straße by 700 meters.</seg>
<seg id="6">Drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Street to the right.</seg>
<seg id="7">The advantage of this is that traffic is divided in the early stages, which improves the overall flow of traffic on the busy section of the federal highway 51.</seg>
<seg id="8">The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the districts of Münster-West.</seg>
<seg id="9">The road narrowing on the feeder annoys drivers especially between 17 and 19 o'clock.</seg>
<seg id="10">On weekdays, the backstage extends up to the bridge over the Alberian Way and sometimes beyond.</seg>
<seg id="11">The reason is the needle hole on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler Straße.</seg>
<seg id="12">From here, traffic is only guided via the motorway bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second track had to be built back in a good three-fourths of years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The reason: static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity to record heavy duty traffic in two lanes.</seg>
<seg id="15">As long as this bottleneck and the related daily traffic jam will continue, the responsible state company cannot say.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, with years to expect: because the bridge has an official remaining duration until 2034.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally, at night, one lies awake for hours, in the morning is already well ahead of the wakeup bell no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one-quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders occur?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes for them, says Hans-Günter WeGebr, member of the board of the German Society for Sleeping and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one understands for the time being, however, is the insomnia, i.e. a single- and dormant-disturbance.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "when sleeping, many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate," "" "says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the Executive Board of the German Medical Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently is the sleep disturbance expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early waking up is often common in a depression," "" "says Wey." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">Those who, for example, have a herniated disc, can lie bad, wake up every two to three hours and possibly begins to salute about everyday problems and worries, gives them an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week and are affected by the day should go to the doctor, advises</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">To ease sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Among other things, treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medication - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep-medical centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, is hardly available in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="23">For this reason, when sleeping problems, one should first turn to the family doctor, "Meeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be done with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the case of snoring, doctors advise doctors, for example, in snoring with respiratory stimulators, in case of abnormal daytime fatigue, sleep transducers, or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, "Fietze explains.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not make a nap," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After clinging, you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">In addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">There is also a camera on the ceiling of the sleeping-ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of screws on which you can apply for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It includes: regular sleep and uplift times, do not sleep too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for sleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Dusseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">The police of the police of Düsseldorf managed to capture two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several handkerchiefs and baggage steels as a gang.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the police from past theft events.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences this year since the middle of July, and had proceeded in a community, division and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the crime commissariats 34 can demonstrate four actions to thieves who had entered Germany especially for the offence of criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between there is still a rest of cobblestones: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">If one walks along the road from east to west, one passes at playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bioladen.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has sprayed on the facade of a grey house." "" "ugly!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it will be built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be created.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, will be favored by burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rental contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin Interior senator Henkel has spoken several times for a hard drive of the police against the project, the area referred to as "No-Go-Zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">On June 22, the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadet smiths, were cleared with 300 police officers, the police patrolled official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners renovated the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later police and construction workers went down under the cheering of sympathizers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others entertain in front of late i.</seg>
<seg id="12">A primary school and kindergartens are located in the immediate vicinity of the building projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is raising three children here, is mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who wanted more police protection against vandaliating leftists.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch, which the Berlin interior senator and the police do between the occupiers and their neighbours does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which today also has a low average income and high poverty risk compared to the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the resulting housing projects have been part of the neighborhood for a long time: in 1990, many houses in the former GDR were occupied, among them almost the entire Main Street very close to the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer was cleared under great police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the neighborhood has become a magnet for tourists and electors from around the world in recent years: residents from the GDR times and former house-occupants now share their neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have increased by almost 60 per cent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by discarded panes or freshly painted facades thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year as often as" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours consider this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by criminality: criminals such as body assault are according to statistics almost exclusively against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most part of the offences make property damage, which tend to hit the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a rented house next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "as for violence, it is important: the 94 people are their neighbors, they are certainly not." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it right in the old Riga.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is consciously pulled into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">This is why it was also so important that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media who all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless newbuildings in former buildings, which displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - here rather people are living here who are not so well bed," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if someone never listens to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those drawn with color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws near should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub district, can complain badly about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is a new Commissioner for Refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the Refugee Agency for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of the Administration for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">She sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, Working Group, Refugees, Administration, Authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine's customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is here, the egg-cutting Wollmechsau, which above all has a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">This meant that some - less mocking than on the multitude of tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an experienced Wollmechsau.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as network activities.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">She has limited a 50 percent job for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers stand in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landratsamt to Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it does not work so that one relies on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, common apartments must be intimidated, as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be installed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine's customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-euro jobs and helplessness for refugees and migrants who need to be grounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community will lead to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a feeling of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So it takes offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So also administration and volunteers jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They must explain to the refugees that it takes time and they can bridge the time sensibly, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Whoever develops the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, can't work and be useless, he will never integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there are also problem cases, says customer honestly, "people where nothing goes wrong." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: did the two after the recent occurrences fear radicalization, also in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some people call naïve" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitised.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also the subject of the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would completely revoke them.</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "" "" "they want to show that they don't have anything to do with it," "" "says Regine Customer." ""</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So the main and volunteers will have to look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly is the policy.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site helpers.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we haven't arrived in Urbach, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would unwind the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the certificates are already used to integrate the existing people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, both women are in agreement.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
