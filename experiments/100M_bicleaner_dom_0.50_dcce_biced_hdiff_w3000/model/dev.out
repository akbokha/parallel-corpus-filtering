Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
at the meeting , however , it should also be about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal of the Obama promoted deal about Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship between the two continues to deterior@@ ate .
in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partially regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election ahead of its time in Israel .
in an emergency call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told with a somewhat c@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
it was important to stress that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was scri@@ bed on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university employees heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fat@@ eful emergency call sometime afterwards .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , the Lamb praised , said he also seemed a little excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any longer .
after fle@@ eing from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs Spur when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson said .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why lamb went to this house , but Johnson said she believed that he knew the people who lived there .
lamb grew up in the area .
in 2009 , Lamb began his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught Ge@@ ography and Ped@@ ago@@ gy .
he did a doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ lay said she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met together with common friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the s@@ warm of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls melted away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 , living in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
in the emergency call Lamb said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said that they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail joined them both on a summer carnival three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after having finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were sitting up and jo@@ king together .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his bro@@ therhood and student committee .
on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commemor@@ ative ceremony .
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the investig@@ ator while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had made the emergency call after he shot himself , and that lamb is calling Pr@@ enti@@ ss in his emergency call as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workers for the Christmas season
To@@ ys R Us says that there won &apos;t be so many Christmas season staff as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers all over the country . 45@@ ,000 workers were hired during the Christmas season 2014 .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees is rising from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , Christmas business is getting closer and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equi@@ p shops with employees who sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty beside me , and it will become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simulated gr@@ en@@ ade and a scar@@ let length from being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really is for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the UN boss once again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , the United Kingdom and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the Council of Ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tac@@ kling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey results showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in poll@@ s , it has ( still ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at that time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was handed over to the asc@@ ending Her@@ man Cain , none of which has just won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hes Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth are now recognis@@ ing tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and starting to drop their dollars to t@@ opp@@ le him .
here are some recent survey data suggest@@ ing that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ umps popularity values have turned around 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a positive opinion of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early stages .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; thrilled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next in matters of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the establishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate .
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans don &apos;t see tr@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans believe that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temp@@ er for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the first state selection state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament pas@@ se not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they put up their teachings , Republi@@ can voters think Tr@@ ump is real .
when asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change from the time when four of ten of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination versus just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is shown that a variety of GO@@ P voters are viewing the tr@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump beat almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ umps leadership , while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can Candi@@ dates , Tr@@ ump picks up the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have made their minds .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have strongly awarded their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say never change opinion .
46 percent said they leave the door open in order to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , tr@@ umps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for Tr@@ ump .
six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump called in his election campaign two months ago immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse was held in 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump crucial His@@ pan@@ o Americans will be kept away by the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / post @-@ survey of Monday , six of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , Donald Tr@@ ump apparently does .
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new levels .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders .
six out of 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days Survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are also mad at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of the four I@@ owa Repub@@ lic@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent &quot; hell@@ ishly anger@@ ed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive urban@@ ization - with a view over the North Sea .
in the street , a square meter of a th@@ at@@ ched roof costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the study - hence the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows , in which special locations one square meter is the most cost .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential neighbor@@ hoods , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros per square meter , well @-@ marked .
but well , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here exceptionally not at the top .
champi@@ ons League : dream starts thanks to mil@@ ler and i@@ dol
dup@@ licate Tor@@ tu@@ ze in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller pa@@ yed the way to FC Bayern into a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the world champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave the FC Bayern into a dream start to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team of coaches P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry ( 8@@ 9. ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth race success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to catch the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t in Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th match in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership , Müller was given a good support by Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who suffered a shot of the World Champion as flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern @-@ Captain Philip Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based ones kept the word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated vision without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent home games in the royal class , among them well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) stum@@ bled here in 2011 .
but Bavaria , defeated in seven European teams with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went on cour@@ age@@ ously , but often came to work with their aggressive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by a game shift on left @-@ air Douglas Costa , which was rarely seen against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k hit the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion awarded the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first of all , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown struck Poland &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 ) .
then , by appointment , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 ) .
although the Bav@@ arians have used their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could place need@@ les .
but on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ ance .
so when he led a shot from Ide@@ ye on the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
in front of New@@ er , Guardi@@ ola led a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who made it well .
Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the ca@@ vern , sat outside at first .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports steering committee Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also during the first change , Guardian decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 51 ) .
Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller made one more .
before the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of hosts Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went on strike against the Munich supporters .
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : at the same time , the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several staff members of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in comparison to non @-@ smokers , smokers were at risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ fold .
the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants .
the main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth therefore goes back to more frequent g@@ ums in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained the author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , the head of study H@@ einer Boeing suggested by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and results in good dental health to a high age according to our findings .
in Germany over 20 percent of the population aged 65 @-@ 74 were affected by lack of tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E par@@ ted .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking may increase the risk of early tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists reach Cologne &apos;s Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants from the late Anti@@ quity .
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are looking for so @-@ called soil monuments .
for all construction projects in the municipal district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as the Department of Archae@@ ological Land@@ scape Conservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists were now five .
from text documents had already been known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , Trier explained .
in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with about 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman tra@@ cked by freight train
after a young woman arrives at the railway station in Lin@@ den@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the Federal Police is asking the population for help .
early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ pm the woman crossed the railway station building at the end of the railway platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , she bore the he@@ avi@@ est violations by the capture of the train .
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
about the reason of the noc@@ tur@@ nal cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there are no findings to the intermedi@@ ary function@@ aries .
the incident has possibly been observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
in@@ quired , local residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Bri@@ ck@@ bro@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to shar@@ pen the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controversial private arbit@@ ration apparatus for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström on the idea . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de is propos@@ ing to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the Free Trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TTIP is supposed to be the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings show con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new arbit@@ ration court .
they are to come to equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time a second instance is provided .
it would allow it to appeal against judgment .
so far , the parties agreed with each other to arbit@@ ers , there was no objection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it wants to work for an international investment court according to its own specifications .
there could , for example , settle disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the Investor @-@ State Dis@@ pute Sett@@ lements ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great opposition in Europe against TTIP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a sort of parallel justice , on which companies can contest damages of tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act referred to the European Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient .
the criticism was , above all , that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
by contrast , the German Secretary of State , Matthias Mach@@ iny ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association Business@@ Europe warned against restric@@ ting the law@@ suits of the economy through too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer durable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the in@@ timi@@ dating fol@@ k@@ singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost gr@@ asp@@ ed by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s talk .
he tells of different places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs report .
where they were created and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer .
with the 2003 released and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmonious very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can be dri@@ fting at any time into the great opul@@ ent .
the rum@@ our that &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should be reported in a row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens can be reduced here .
live guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
a year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Illinois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , a renowned masterpiece appears in 2005 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over@@ flowing with ideas and styl@@ istic refin@@ ement .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is not missing in any annual list of influential music media .
after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) with very extensive electronic pieces .
this sixth full studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but programmed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ ber@@ ations .
as long as the smaller club has boar@@ ded the stage shows , the stage shows are here for the colorful spectacle from ne@@ on @-@ head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the glo@@ om@@ ily kept ham@@ burger More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which has been available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2,000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , who has become much more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without directing a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and one can thus throw away the &quot; record in essence . &quot;
only at an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed himself , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and eventually bowed down under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut in the prime minister &apos;s fra@@ cking
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s question@@ son with suspen@@ se since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will be making his debut in the prime minister &apos;s question@@ son and for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six pre @-@ defined issues shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from the region .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the national an@@ them during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has prov@@ oked a cri@@ tique of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several front pages Stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has drawn attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; stood in dis@@ respect@@ ful silence &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s Schatten@@ ber@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party supported him as a leader .
the Political Cor@@ respon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; st@@ acking &quot; within Labour , according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour made changes to remove the whole idea of a limit altogether .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow @-@ Labour and R@@ ent Minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron , ever since he &apos;s T@@ ory boss , over the Dis@@ patch box in the Parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who promised another politi@@ cian , states that he has &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are to be confronted with , and that he is subjected to both &quot; impact and stri@@ pping &quot; and has instead focused on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Foreign Minister , is represented if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he appe@@ aled to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a guide in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy Theatre , &quot; which is often linked to the prime minister &apos;s question@@ son . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the meeting with the Prime Minister was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his leadership in the House of Parliament and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ aries , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed extensive reforms .

pounds increase by accelerated pay@@ roll growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose mark@@ edly according to data which indicate an increase in the growth of the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was hei@@ gh@@ tened by the goal of SA@@ B@@ Miller .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est rate since 2009 and has been estim@@ ating estimates of the timing of an increase in interest rates .
the pound has climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after taking receipt of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competi@@ tor group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reported growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion through a stock sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares of the packaging and paper group Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his assessment for the company R@@ ating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports says higher wages are endanger@@ ing expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs with its company , he says .
the cost could hit the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean there are less additional jobs .

PE@@ GI@@ DA poster brings Lebanese to the idea of a potato @-@ don@@ er idea
potatoes or don@@ ors ?
it goes both - and in the potato twe@@ eter , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger burger owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; potato instead of don@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potatoes and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he accidentally saw on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a grill sk@@ ewer has turned into its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lebanon &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has meanwhile been registered at the patent office in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility patent .
for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes a sk@@ ewer has .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only as much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also comes up well with its customers .
met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches In@@ flu@@ ence campaign to combat aging
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branches off an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground stand campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in the run @-@ up to a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets are strengthening their relationship with local food suppliers and building the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and stores shop@@ keepers who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will disclose further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment passes its annual investment strategy day .
it is much in the game since South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern states .
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after opening its first markets and remove all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and in the amount of a high fixed cost base Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost around € 13 million in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash lost market shares in the eastern states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan had found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley estimates that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told that Met@@ cash would probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , IG@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenue from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food Trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retail outlets , has been 43 per cent since 2012 , reflecting operating debt reduction with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler , however , def@@ ends itself and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to equ@@ alize sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores through faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop refurb@@ ishment programs are going to grow to El@@ an and hopes that in 2017 the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ ril and deserves praise for his own behavior according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is often referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came to the li@@ mel@@ ight through the in@@ famous engagement of Cy@@ rene with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called out : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka had to beat Kyr@@ gios , and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp sh@@ ook a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was def@@ tly defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m quite excited about is the fact that after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost in the US Open because of a cra@@ mp but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket out of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too strictly .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he &apos;s well in shape , he &apos;s a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision , which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed component to the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Cy@@ rene &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I believe that Nick was very quick to climb to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to support him , and it is best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declared emergency situation , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to get illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a land stre@@ ak on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants shot &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tur@@ mo@@ il at the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ year bloc at a disputed meeting in Brussels which could not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the shr@@ inking Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be reached that the EU states would accept another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis in the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a swift action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emergency stand called on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country - after having completed a fence at the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even j@@ ail@@ ers were deployed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a major bott@@ len@@ eck and an entry point in the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the emerging economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that strongly contradic@@ ts other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia to a crime . these laws also impose tough@@ er prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation caused by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the emergency situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we say very clearly : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal border crossing is a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament must yet agree with the deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but Repor@@ ters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er for Or@@ ban said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are to quickly repair the fence .
Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders was arrived .
chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 succeeded in coming in , but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s Vorsprung durch Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race for nomin@@ ating at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her face to the ground .
Clinton is now backing the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent before ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the Democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the beginning of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines which candidate they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more resistant in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ ander achieved a few wins .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders only back with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries across the country say they would support Clinton if she was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
they wouldn &apos;t support six percent .
maybe it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter she would enthusias@@ tically support .
while 48 percent of the Democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their peak candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned by Clinton &apos;s supporters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate will also be quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice President has a potential for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to vote for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton increases his lead over S@@ anders from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds of winning the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 per cent last month .
Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that looks at it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; has risen .
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call for questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unlike last month , not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries appears unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some key features among voters in the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities .
in the three candidates , Bi@@ den is the best in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of it .
democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements one quarter of the democratic voters do not have the opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server will continue to be questioned during the term of office as foreign minister , most of the Democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether .
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion of this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the email controversy had no impact on their general opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it had worsen@@ ed .
it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters . only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not consider it an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time 55 per cent of voting rights country@@ wide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks on leadership .
among the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority sees S@@ anders as honest , but as with Car@@ son many do not think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic votes in the prim@@ aries is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son wins nationwide survey behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times
the two Candi@@ dates now account for half of the voters &apos; support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support increases from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey conducted on Tuesday .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and out@@ performs Tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ con@@ sin Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell in the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor of Florida , J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place at 6 % .
the fault margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son is in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post also revealed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a look at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump took some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for questioning tr@@ umps of faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearances in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are only measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea might be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people do not go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , according to the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
by contrast , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the east it is even up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic Sea it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt is 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood stra@@ ined with the death of Bar@@ uch College newcom@@ ers
nearly two years after a student died during a bul@@ ky ritual of a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , mur@@ ders were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 brut@@ ally and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , divided the police .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and re@@ port@@ edly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , said Poli@@ zi@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the essenti@@ als and basically presented the good of the Brotherhood with Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ zi@@ ef Wagner .
he could not be revi@@ ved and he died the next morning at his injuries .
following an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and th@@ igh with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sh@@ kan@@ en of the Brotherhood . at least one student died each year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation .
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a charge for murder of the third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of illegal attacks and formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College had forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood ral@@ lied their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a interest increase comes , and the house will fall into dr@@ unk@@ enness , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will be sli@@ pping into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides little guidance on the process .
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
so representatives of the US Central Bank have so severely stressed that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
at the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement caused by interest increase could possibly be exagger@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money &quot; era , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a view on historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that earnings will be deduc@@ ed from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study of what happens after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more precisely , the market is usually upward trend in the past 35 years - approximately 14 percent - on the road to interest increase , quite flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal condition after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent , according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Chief Investment Strategy at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ ding to occur later in the enhancement cycle and the return thus begins to decrease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and could accelerate a recession .
it is particularly not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , a nominal GDP less than 4.5 percent since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants held a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all hat@@ ching cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super @-@ cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and before rec@@ essions were put into the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volatile as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than with shares if they change their strategic course .
in the case of bonds , returns seem to change direction as soon as the first increase in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the enhancement cycle , the bond yields immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will result in returns between longer and shorter bonds closer together and leading to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high @-@ interest loans often yield better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
it is interesting that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending margins increased and volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in large and entire , companies that handle the greater part of their business in the US will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a major problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are losing the most , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
outside of pure stock plays , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see gains through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how fast it will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says EP member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament &apos;s conserv@@ atory critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly reluct@@ ant to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; show and said this wasn &apos;t very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says a leading member of Parliament and boo@@ sts new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly could no longer be distinguished from its commercial ri@@ vals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to be turning to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously @-@ called examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and public education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and playing music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder to work was to engage audiences as it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only member of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show purchased by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in a special BBC fashion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wants the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hit a hit from our in @-@ house stall &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it star@@ ed in a series of entertainment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to exclude the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money on other entertainment formats for other entertainment formats .
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month , there was the lowest earnings since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday slow@@ ed spending in November
for over a decade the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started to make purchases using their mobile phones .
it meant more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , for example at home on the sofa .
but now this comm@@ its itself , and we may see that growth dimin@@ ishes .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for decreasing sales .
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , where buyers are fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium concluded that out of £ 5 , expenditure was spent little over £ 1 online .
in some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now being carried out over web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims during the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia sets the collapse in part of the huge Sau@@ dis Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ners met , largely dressed in white , the stretch to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last trip to the al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the procession went past the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane went through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell to the worshi@@ ppers .
the bodies were released for burial when the Saudi king imposed a san@@ ction on the bin Laden &apos;s construction company because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 victims who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane subsi@@ ded .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Grand Mos@@ que .
Saudi officers have already stated that the H@@ add@@ les will continue to go to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have allowed the crane arm to stand when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service of the news agency did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad is prohibited .
at the beginning of this week Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ amed the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because she had not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected with the Saudi Arabia &apos;s ruling family for decades and takes over larger building projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a detached son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the fall of the crane came in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said that 15@@ 8 people stay in the hospital .
government officials stated that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other clubs receive half of this amount .

because the British are increasingly employing cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople in order to make DIY jobs in their houses , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new managing director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of qualified professional tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe that offer services to low @-@ cost prices has meanwhile been out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions in the store are taken by women .
at the moment men predomin@@ ate .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our stores .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this to balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a matter of principle , half of our clients are women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores .
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before the Court
on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob will be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and ev@@ asion .
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he was legally acqu@@ itted in May of this alle@@ gation in May .
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , during the preliminary examination , the accused decided that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the accused used funds from the association &apos;s accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of financial offen@@ ders .
this fact was eliminated by the chairman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller sen@@ ate , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
for the off@@ ence of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset had ar@@ isen .
the sports officials only had compens@@ ations for compens@@ ations and the sports club , for which they were active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to approximately 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we continue to run the club or block it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants said in the bread@@ making profession of the financial officer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said when he was arrested . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , you must not pay any debt .
on the other hand , the reimbur@@ sement of compens@@ ations for reimbur@@ sement of compens@@ ations retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 was decided in the case of the corresponding financial - success .
therefore one part of the compens@@ ations was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was in the account .
therefore , package and not detailed cancell@@ ations seemed as well , the former chairman explained the processes .
the accounts and pass@@ books by the two accused together , said the second defend@@ ant .
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial speculation , it is important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 against the one function@@ ary investigating the abuse of the territory , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these had been la@@ yo@@ ffs , declared the defend@@ ants .
this securities account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant and according to the statement the association was not known .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
after all , he said he had believed that this was the best for the association .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the public prosec@@ utor put in the room .
the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claim re@@ payment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first defend@@ ant stated that he was not in agreement with this formulation , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do when the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said he had never obtained a cent salary , he only reck@@ oned with mil@@ eage and di@@ eting .
on diets he bil@@ led the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added .
the defend@@ ants were unable to provide accurate records for the early years .
these were no longer kept after an inspection in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared .
the second defend@@ ant also referred to the mil@@ eage money .
all the exercises can be made in cash , and from his place of residence , he had to drive to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard supplies another 30,000 jobs
in addition to the staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the computer will break down further jobs in spl@@ itting the company .
the Stell@@ enb@@ acks at the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs amoun@@ ting to USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employs some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard stock was 2.3 percent on the market .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto group , which has grown with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led into a new company - apart from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts should be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services were the latest in the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer .
in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales dropped by 8 percent to just under US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
as a result , revenues declined in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds with spl@@ itting and massive adjustments to the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted late to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers , and do more and more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
but a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would predominantly be rejected : 54 percent spoke against it , and 35 percent agreed .
the fact that other countries are flying air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria will find 61 percent positive .
on the other hand , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict .
a collaboration with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , backs 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed , and 20 percent would be responsible for this .
29 per cent couldn &apos;t decide .
car : second day of the press at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A

&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wide audience can attend the IA@@ A from Saturday .
like two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA Auto Association anticipate some 900@@ ,000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence erup@@ tion at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water cann@@ on against several hundreds of abandoned refugees .
D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k , the Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent , has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
a police line had been formed behind it and a water cann@@ on stood behind the police officers .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials were initially using pe@@ pper@@ y spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
in this way , the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn a bit .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children , who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
the time to decide on interest rates for the US central bank
the world is watching when the US central bank comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether the interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ eyed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , which was still the last week of the view that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates on the current stand will hold from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est placed interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave zero and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior colleague at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a move are good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision shall be announced at 20.@@ 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Gu@@ ards at the Delta State University left an excuse for par@@ ap@@ hr@@ asing
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot his colleagues on the day later - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot someone and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency call center that police had to send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I &apos;ve ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb went 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en who said she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but they remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Know@@ les said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had kind@@ red relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not going to prison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when polic@@ emen caught him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
lamb received a doctoral title from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , just like his li@@ ke@@ over at the University &apos;s website .
stars that have lost their luck charm

all this certainly demands its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa builds the Group
Lufthansa plans to build a large group of companies .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year with a better organisation alone .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1000 executives will cost the work@@ space for the Group .
however , there are new negotiations with the pilot trade union .
Lufthansa builds its corporate structure and utili@@ zes Eu@@ row@@ ings &apos; low @-@ cost accounting .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of some 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , in the future Lufthansa will no longer be a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive team of CEO Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr .
with this new order , Spo@@ hr under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the company wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operated under the roof of the Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of annual sales of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the collective bar@@ gaining agreement with the pilot @-@ st@@ oning cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the court @-@ packed strike on this Thursday .
this is what the union divided .
the topic of the talks should be the retirement regulations for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predic@@ ated record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; background is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings concept in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa will be reloc@@ ating routes to the Group &apos;s own equity line Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
while this brings the left outer defender to weeping and exclu@@ des him for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it is horrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frame , it will take six months and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno was happy to be able to escape a red card and the hanging of a meters .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet to Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery starts now , I come back stronger . &quot;

Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player leaves the square with this kind of injury , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ ene Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ c@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was heading in another direction , so it looked as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron knows better for The Lor@@ ax ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t be long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron perhaps .
when asked by a provider of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister decided for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book instead gives a summary of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to expand the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win a real tree , &quot; one reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name was The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel and died in 1991 but completely unknown .
as if that wasn &apos;t suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is arti@@ ficially and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , hopes to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the action of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears about how the local environment is devast@@ ated by the prot@@ rac@@ ted , trees adul@@ ter@@ ating , Th@@ need kn@@ itting Once @-@ ler , despite the protests of the ep@@ onymous Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ck@@ ling , snow@@ y creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s election circle .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but gave no further comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it &apos;s still hard
hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the Ka@@ der that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 Test Series defeat is not on my map .
I would not exclude a forward victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batch setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th escap@@ es from the England Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th , of course , is hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have extended the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own destiny .
if he hopefully turns out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he did not get so good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question how much time a test pun@@ cher gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and go backwards .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set off Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set high .
he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season early when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much .
he must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and get four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s sk@@ id of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een probably did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as a op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately repe@@ aled three hundred R@@ uns and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup sp@@ inners that raise their hands and the trainers have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful engagement to the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ downs , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I don &apos;t have any problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team members do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit from the UK from the EU ) could gain access if the economy into a dol@@ drums until 2017
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ announced new negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who was viol@@ ently broken because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states , so deeply involved in various crises , as the EU is now and not always on their own guilt , Great Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive contractual changes , which they usually do not want , are full .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if it je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zes social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wants an outside Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; Don &apos;t let us alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it has happened in the long @-@ term endurance races such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look forward to his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
it is also a failing strength .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland leaving the UK - something they do not want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even intentionally not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press , but not those who supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade Ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 1990s .
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone inter@@ cep@@ ting foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her , but found that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of having lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly liqu@@ or on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he had no time to waste time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 @-@ s , a mistake back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ b@@ stoff @-@ Ten@@ dency and the wild Gef@@ il@@ den of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow chan@@ cell@@ or was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be loyal to his Labour cabinet @-@ mates without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under any circum@@ stance - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday night .
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n tries to convey - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News discipline remains important in the era of TV 24 / 7 and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no exemp@@ tion for Europe that allows him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks so .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the little difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about Nato - Tom Wat@@ son believes that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home in everything .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded when starting on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critici@@ ze public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
asser@@ tions of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with connections to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; Basic Pro@@ visions &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
but some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y foundation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis ( MC@@ DA ) evaluation model in order to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director was previously reported to have received funding from British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received after reports from tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for choosing the members of the board are not provided , but include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of p@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; noted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most of the criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations is discussed in the p@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes have been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J were already re@@ acted in advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are significantly less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
p@@ he has a clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers compared to tobacco .
nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the national health system two billion pounds per year .
by showing up @-@ to @-@ date evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national competence .
BBC should give up East@@ on , says For@@ mer Chef of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as the Albert Square soap .
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK channels .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and channels like BB@@ C@@ 4 .
after the BBC Director , Tony Hall said that he wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get into contact with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast that would also be clearly demonstrated by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast fee , what I consider medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least put his production on programs that others do not do or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time@@ frame because they want to achieve the best possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , of course it &apos;s non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax will finance programs that could also be funded without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I would like to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts will be what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ day gart teaching in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows like East@@ on should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue when they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion pounds of radio , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee for the broadcast fee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think that you get a great value for 150 pounds per year , but for people who are for the 150 pounds a lot of money , wonder if that is true because they do not consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former SK@@ Y@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , form and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only little of BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; inform@@ ing , enligh@@ tening and talking about the public television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , by which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with the commercial channels alliances enter to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ bur@@ sts of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound pulses , which have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on the Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to support the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m channels that react to ultrasound waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new procedure called Son@@ o@@ genetics that can be used with ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive method that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
th@@ read@@ worms usually do not react on ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid containing micro@@ scopic air bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the di@@ aph@@ rag@@ ms by some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultras@@ on@@ ically to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the modified Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the process has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that allows scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light that needs to be sent to the desired position in the brain in an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultras@@ onic waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; Chal@@ as@@ ani said .
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters , which can be seen at bus stops and subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : go from 15 to 18 September with the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) one reads in the font types of the London Underground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line that turns into the image of a tank .

the 300 posters have been exhibited by artists who exhibited their work in the Museum of Cru@@ el Designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective called Special Pat@@ rol Group contributed to the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 £ -@@ pack of Allen keys , which claims to &quot; access to around one @-@ third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the gun trade - through a lead of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic , shad@@ y company advertisement , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the blu@@ ing with bright colours and animation it remains sti@@ cky . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us shar@@ pen the awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the trade fair , &quot; said Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty .

eight golden rules for living in student halls
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ for@@ get@@ ful 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance to student resi@@ dences reaches from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it is temp@@ ting to sni@@ ff : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have sab@@ bath year , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly , Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , boys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak even if your eyel@@ ashes were ign@@ ited and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be .
let people be .
people often turn into drinks reception , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress up and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert will receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can be friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ alizing - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking instead .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ eks .
as you start the university at the height of back @-@ Man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I baked something for you . so , and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain and eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poorly mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence .
of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken are a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ?
check that with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say they use themselves , even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal with a more balanced deal than my room@@ mate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb you belong to the people sitting in the glass house .
a girl on my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if they had something to make Drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more lou@@ der music .
when they finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep for two hours before she pl@@ ung@@ ed her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour examination .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would enter the same residence hall by chance ?
on the other hand , it would not be pro@@ found@@ ly embarrass@@ ing if you would like to keep a room@@ mate for your future spouse , ran@@ gle her , separate herself and then see her every day and perhaps see her coming up with all her common friends ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment when you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good one is funny , but it only takes moments before he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never fail someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but pack your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single parents , low @-@ ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds town@@ houses in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian corner of the corner for people who don &apos;t have a lot of money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need residential space , but also the mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ners alone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build well and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds up town@@ houses for refugees in a project .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gym@@ nasi@@ ums has no sustainability .
for the people remain a great part here .
in view of the influ@@ x of refugees we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a semi @-@ detached house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if one puts people into residential blocks .
each of the six homes that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can easily be rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
this is appropriate .
do the building regulations make their plans complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : I have dra@@ fted my project correctly .
especially complicated it always makes the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the posi@@ tional regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is no place for this .
refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the local residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what definitely isn &apos;t right .
but do you not shar@@ pen the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : it &apos;s true that we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .
not only the refugees but also the single mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ners .
I would like to show you how to build well and well today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the settings app , type &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after the installation , as they receive an error message indicating that the &quot; software update is failed . &quot;
to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean dropping apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the stream@@ lining of the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is complete .
it is worth ensuring that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch off half way and this could lead to a termination of the update .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
the chess club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; founded three months ago , has recorded another member in its ranks , thus the membership number rose to 19 players .
the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Federal Cross @-@ Service Cross 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which accepted President Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot get the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent search should also be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district Office looks for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ di and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined the social foundation and opened a new centre at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides consultations , you can also take part in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely , to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , directly next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as health insurance or health and nursing homes .
for years now , we have been working with our out@@ patient care service that often caring relatives are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even though the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new house@@ keeper Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ py@@ ard and the Bürger@@ sp@@ ital and the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ di was taken into the boat .
it is therefore possible to use additional offers such as prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ di complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ di stands for prevention , for@@ esi@@ ght and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ di .
both business leaders see the reason for opening the new district office in the city centre particularly in the demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future essential .
in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates himself to the association at the age of inaugur@@ ation : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able co @-@ operation . &quot;
in this way , the Social Foundation makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 : 00 to 18 : 00 and Saturday from 10 : 00 to 12 o &apos;clock .

according to his own statement , he wants to have added 30 kilograms of muscle mass according to his own statement in the last two years .
intellectu@@ ally , however , he did not assign it .
in Bremen &apos;s inner city , lawn had just cut off the hair , when he saw a car park atten@@ dant made a bal@@ lot for his white Chev@@ ro@@ let Cam@@ aro .

in Bremen , one confirms the alle@@ gations , but is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that will decide whether meadow is displayed , or not .

men beating over 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed according to the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft petrol station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men now scre@@ amed the young man and struck it with his fist .
the victim suffered a nose @-@ leg here and ble@@ ed heavily out of the nose .
when his two friends hur@@ ried and appe@@ aled to the thu@@ gs , he left his victim first .
the injured young man was now brought home from his friends .
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed several times there .
when you didn &apos;t see the car anymore , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male .
with the help of a stroke , the victim was examined and the thi@@ ghs of the victim were examined .
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue agency description is present .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket should have been about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was clothed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice Fel@@ lows and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows .
furthermore , Sam@@ t@@ gemein@@ de@@ may@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing luck : Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Fel@@ lows on October 1 .
while Ur@@ sel &apos;s reti@@ ring goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing by half a point in the next few months .
after a conversion phase Müller opens the office on 12 October , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10,000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when the fields of the field met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing their specialist medical training at the Ver@@ den hospital , who also wants to get into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the Müll@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of doing their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon .
and so one agreed that the Müll@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time father Frank Müller grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover , followed by stations in several medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a senior emergency doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
as of September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
while the surgeon Dr Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lows works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as family doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the endos@@ copy will come out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and stress @-@ EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
in addition , the computer is completely renewed .
the Müll@@ ers receive a total of 50@@ 000 Euros as part of a funding programme from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ t@@ gemein@@ de@@ may@@ meister Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the practice Fel@@ lows in every quarter , while in the North German average practice there are about 500 patients .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf , there is another general practitioner practice .
a positive side effect of the practice tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel Haus Sonn@@ sel .
if no successor was found , it would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos; consultations also continue to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms .
with their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ur@@ sel &apos;s Fel@@ lows with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she already felt a little sad@@ ness after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we &apos;re still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the boarding school . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband laugh@@ ingly adds : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pushed myself down in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to ask for asylum can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the focus is on the supply and safety of the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is clear , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , nor of the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia den@@ ies &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously reported that Slovenia also wanted to move on arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and , under certain circumstances , also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is how the Interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
as the Minister stressed , Slovenia would not want to abri@@ dge its borders for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system can &apos;t work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik is constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
in the coming days his country reck@@ oned with some 4,000 refugees , Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which previously had brought immigrants to the Hungarian border , were re@@ directed to Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media agreed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Belgrade government , however , denied that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the road all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
this could actually lead to a postpon@@ ement of the earlier Balkan route from Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat further west @-@ west route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive border control opportunities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed earlier that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional circumstances in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
strict controls are carried out to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then , EU partners have consistently regarded the country as a good reference to the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they had spent the night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ gs remain completely blocked .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm down Wednesday at a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he stops the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there would not be very high numbers of refugees at this time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise immigrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute land maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent in the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about cy@@ ber criminals who are accused of gaining insight into still un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as business Wire , Market@@ wired and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der transactions are said to have been made on the financial markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , a total of over $ 100 million was launched to investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately trapped &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the trial against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators are said to have acted both in the US and from Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim has existed for 20 years
the company operates around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .

they control the two stations of the Mannheim Aut@@ os@@ al@@ ons at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
holding the city &apos;s web@@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ cing life with wonderful autumn sunshine and in the middle of it four big plates with the heading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ aid was attentive to its 20th anniversary with this action and faced mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went to the city and people with the action , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce remedy is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and talks , such as the volunteer workers .
while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously reach the chal@@ k and read the phrase &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; can read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer long , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I am not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again , on the br@@ ink of small discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying .
Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is also on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only when I realize that some@@ day the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband bearer of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce relief . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore this action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the fact that not everyone does not want to communicate publicly on the tablets , however , is understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the subject of death and dying is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed greatly to the fact that people are opening up .
an estim@@ ation that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning companion is part of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted with personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid sought Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , she immediately announced herself and was there when it was founded in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the suffer@@ ers and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ ce Saint Vincent .
they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her task and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see life from another commodity , precious and precious for the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as training and super@@ visions of the death and mour@@ ners .
every two years , training courses for new employees are offered .
the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the house of the Catholic church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) .
further personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , financial prospects lowered for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his earnings outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at that time last year F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share fell by more than 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said earning a profit between $ 10.@@ 40 and € 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ .
the lower prospect is despite the price increases , which are average 4.@@ 9 percent and will take effect on 4 January and despite higher sur@@ charges for body transports of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue , and due to growth in online trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid yields if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation jobs were announced one day later than that of rival U@@ PS , who plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , and the twelve analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research .
sales increased by 5 percent to € 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion dollars .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which posted sales in its unit Express shipping for stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping improved the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
at Pre@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to € 15@@ 0,@@ 15 .
on Tuesday , they closed 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to lift the benchmark for the first time for almost a decade .
threatening above them at an end of the decorated two @-@ story seat @-@ hall is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a double mandate from Congress : keeping US employment and prices stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive through the short @-@ term interest rate that is close to zero since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal securities - and be it only by a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they are watching , &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age firm Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think that if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue waiting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , causing uncertainty about itself the financial market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that only shows a 30 % chance of up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value was 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year it would be necessary despite the complaints of liber@@ als that more economic progress would be needed , an increase in the sentence expected .
although the creation of jobs in August slow@@ ed , improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , head econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value in May fell by more than 16 % below its maximum , as investors feared that slow@@ ing the Chinese economy would stran@@ gle global growth .
the market has recovered a bit this month , with which Dow is now almost 10 % below the month of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation of when to increase interest rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred over the past few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US central bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in the decision @-@ making process .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the mere hint of the former director Ben S Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; narrow down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , F@@ ed representatives are expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her decision making is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more art than science &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Z@@ ach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
var@@ n@@ ishing , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which stands for increased interest rate , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; Lack@@ ner said .
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives canc@@ eled these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only in the first place during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Det@@ ention of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of increasing interest because the markets are getting excited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , president of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should run ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
to give you a warm welcome doesn &apos;t work without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still teaches with her 74 L@@ ess@@ ons .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum application at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , this is a different lesson than at a proper school .
Brazilian Pedi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women on how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck at breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried accepted the building permit for the 2.3 million Euro @-@ expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited hall building on Bern@@ ina &apos;s sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent council session , the elabor@@ ated construction proposal was unanim@@ ously agreed without major discussions .
before that , among other things , the committee had decided on an application for an &quot; exception &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from the valid development plan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be built with a non @-@ centered first and roof top . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar plants : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was again about the roof @-@ inclin@@ ation , which for energetic reasons - different than in the building plan - should lie below ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan ad@@ mits no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the pitch prop@@ ens@@ ity - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der municipal council is generally rather restric@@ tive in the case of liber@@ ating treaties . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is not a recurring project for gymnas@@ tics construction : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
at the cost , some 2.3 million euros are calculated .
subsidies are expected from school and broad@@ band promotion .
in the next stage of the process , the building permit for the 18 x 36 meter large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , who confirmed the land@@ lady Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
however , a decision on this will be made by the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the still existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who do not work with Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change was triggered by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year and is now being transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October onwards and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the field of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the inside station for gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer and his team are supposed to lead the two houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ y , which still has more than 35 beds , should finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the county has planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital has been completed .
Coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is in possession of the Bundes@@ rat , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers .
&quot; I close it . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiss could not say that there are several considerations .
currently there is a short term care of Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the Qu@@ asi removal to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positively and very symp@@ athetic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as a head doctor for more than 30 years has not been given .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened again and again in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics .
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Li@@ ons are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 hrs ) at the Berg@@ ische HC .
the leader of the Bundes@@ liga , however , is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce .
in the past season , the ba@@ thers took a hur@@ t@@ ful defeat at Bh@@ c and got something good there .
Jag@@ mal@@ fall with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were badly injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , as the police announced .
after a shot , a man of 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the Criminal Police as@@ cer@@ tains .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of sixteen @-@ year @-@ old men from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave birth to young people and thrown their bodies into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as the prosec@@ utor and police shared on Wednesday .
on Tuesday evening , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old person who was arrested was deemed to have been suspected of being a suspect , and the investig@@ ator led the investigation to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home on the eve of a visit to an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim .
in the context of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ pse was found .
the det@@ ain@@ ee told the authorities that the police interro@@ gated the 16 @-@ year @-@ olds and put the cor@@ pse on the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him dead .
conclusions about the immediate circumstances of the act are to bring further investigation .
refugees need lodging : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German residential market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking an affordable stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution campaigns on the German residential market have long since begun .
with the incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 .
this is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot; Social H@@ ousing Assembly . &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units will be completed in Germany this year .
there@@ with 140@@ ,000 homes are missing .
refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers after the first three months of their stay as asylum seekers .
many then come across the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office last year , however , less than half of all asylum seekers were employed .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also accounts for significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany shoots an apartment deficit that will grow from year to year .
currently some 77@@ ,000 residential units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ined Matthias Günther , author of the study .
many professionals , therefore , stayed in large cities in need of income in WG rooms .
young adults remained invol@@ un@@ tarily longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market .
in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing development again .
this could be wai@@ ved of the real estate tax and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is subject to temporary exposure .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Cl@@ an .
the funding programme for the state bank Kf@@ W for refugees is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the 300 million Euros have already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with € 18@@ 4 million .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free time : Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , there is practically no coming through , as more and more refugees choose the way through Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees passed to Croatia to reach Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian television station RT@@ L .
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws that came into force on the same day , moreover , make ordinary asylum procedures superf@@ lu@@ ous in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can go through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring Croatia .
according to media reports , most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border the refugees do not come across border f@@ ences .
the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border few more refugees are coming to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 inv@@ aded people .
shortly before the opening on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws prec@@ lu@@ de the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a crime .
in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed , 35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated .
the condemned are threatening sentences ranging from prison sentences up to five years and expul@@ sion from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; established on the border , almost all of them - 93 - the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicant is 13 families with small children and two elderly .
on Wednesday morning there would have been 40 refugees there .
but practically no one has a chance to get asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the rub@@ b@@ ish that tens of thousands of people had left in the road@@ side during the past few weeks .
the barriers were disman@@ tled and one of the recording facilities in the bor@@ der@@ line was rebuilt .
no one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
only a few refugees reach Austria after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
however , around 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government data .
in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the continuation of Germany .
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees met regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mayor drove &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; across the border &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the bridge on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins , the mayor of Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly recru@@ ited the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , however , for her in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his assistance and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the fra@@ mers along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u .
before we left the un@@ hoped guests only once , with a snack and drinks .
we have to say that we bring them to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , after the announcement that the railway traffic was dis@@ continued to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was shut off at the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Brü@@ cken@@ fest linked with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , on the day before a two @-@ bridge run sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends additional tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke &apos;s camp immediately to create structures that guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor officially and publicly tra@@ ded the Hungarian government &apos;s position in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with cha@@ otic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to note that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a major challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the coming winter to produce decent conditions for protection seekers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 3@@ 5.000 winter @-@ proof quarters
Konrad , with the support of refugees , has to do all his hands fully .
Christian Konrad is used to his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank to place quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad already got a grip on the chaos at the first tak@@ eover centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success .
the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees arriving in Austria on Monday was without a great whi@@ rl@@ wind , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad calcul@@ ates a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 lod@@ gings will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20.000 will provide the federal states , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation .
if there are more refugees we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have promised to create quarters for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s fine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , thereby clari@@ fying how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum @-@ ordin@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also takes great expectations in the ORF &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help as we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform private individuals can offer accommodation in an un@@ complicated way .
in addition , it is hoped that hotels , which are vac@@ ant in winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency it could not be that qu@@ arti@@ ers have to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or size of the sky@@ light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period of time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad with his experience , in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , was more successful when he was accommod@@ ated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier don &apos;t cause the republic any cost as they themselves explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
so far , their own quarters have not yet been successful .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but apparently there are problems with the approval .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design centre for the accommodation of refugees plans the city of Linz .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the person concerned can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of emergency , however , further sites should be checked for their suit@@ ability .
the Municipal Council critic@@ ises the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; borders are not sealed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a longer telephone call with Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday cor@@ des further proceedings in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er has assured me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there is now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
however , the protective seekers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that Austria is now taking control of its borders again is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the German approach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a Mat@@ ter of Time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refurb@@ ishment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT group S &amp; T is moved , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies in the new shi@@ py@@ ard , and later on also what to acquire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which is one third of the city of Linz , the province of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 per cent of the 2,@@ 700 square metres remaining in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade had to delay this project : after all , she gained a new business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop , opposite the shop , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of an own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz area who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots .
she has placed her fashion @-@ interest in the cra@@ dle from her mother .
I feel most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women looking at the sight of a hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture can &apos;t answer the professional lady with ultimate certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a beautiful bag gets every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancest@@ or of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called len@@ ders .
this property also connects some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ sets .
whether he expresses himself hostile to foreign affairs , rebu@@ ke re@@ porters or reveal gaps in knowledge in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office stir@@ s up the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire comes from .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the New Yorker with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ öhn@@ fres@@ ur &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a term many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf an der Wein@@ straße . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people in the 1200 inhabit@@ ant town are more than ump@@ teen corners related to it .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt style , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del .
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has turned an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous children , among whom besides Tr@@ ump the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - with the statement that he would be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
to the king of the hearts , he didn &apos;t bring it there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a little a mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the surrounding area , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - in High German : the credi@@ tors , says it .
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the don@@ or .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and in the USA opened a loc@@ ale for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundation of the real estate company was the first real estate sales in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for P@@ relate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as is the case , it &apos;s not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born dr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the win@@ emaker in retirement looks rather dist@@ anced to the Americans , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ ushing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; said the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension econom@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz @-@ family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that of Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who saw the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els &apos;s film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA the interest is awak@@ ened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian community Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabit@@ ant village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Austria there are already 20 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing villages &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in neighbouring countries , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in today &apos;s Today Show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son are moving to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there were no big shifts in the Today &apos;s reviews .
the N@@ ine breakfast show was broadcast by the German capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull made the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , stuck in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this down@@ side of the stand seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers among the five major cities compared with today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , in the past few months , Sunrise closed the gap .
in August , Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 3@@ 30,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 was completed .
up to now in September , sunrise has an average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decided to settle down on New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wondered whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ter star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit slightly The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe invented 44@@ 6,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia made 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half an hour sat@@ te 7@@ 20,000 .
hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a substitute for a million dollars which did not manage to over@@ leaf the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
hidden secret ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins the Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood ends up in The Bachelor , was wrapped up in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who has received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three two , you may have accidentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have been ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be their partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods last Rose &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; could become their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the b@@ achel@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both fast - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought it was quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit made her clear last week that Wood was &quot; one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now pres@@ ump@@ tious on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked who to choose Wood , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a clever decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a triangle as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a Pun@@ t return and also to the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a still showed his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the match .
the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t that was restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian suite had hoped for for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the f@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy to 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his Orig@@ in debut back then in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 year old .

the free elec@@ tors demand the employment of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees .
at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are no corresponding new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free voters conven@@ ed for Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
in fact , other key topics were envis@@ aged .
but the record number of refugees is now also dominated by the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the topic of asylum will super@@ impose the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as was the case during the Yugosla@@ v Wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free voters &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claim : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards for federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police shot rubber stories in a crowd of people demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i District , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu .
B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , with some of them throwing stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot them in the air before re@@ course to rubber floors .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber stories , which are known to kill them , but which are traditionally used as less deadly alternatives , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal where members of the Mad@@ rid@@ i ethnic group say that new provinces formed within the proposed new constitution would dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there have also been protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflict since the age of 10 .
August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally governed for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on the road since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted this week on specific cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials have said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there is still no concrete offer .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of about 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
the plan is to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for corresponding offers , it says on the part of the city .
which investor in@@ quired is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at Ring@@ straße / Corner Street , just a few months ago and the building on it can be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details lying on the table
plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some people are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure facility
for months I had been negotiating , medit@@ ating , deb@@ ating and sket@@ ching behind closed doors .
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the small sea near Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective , medium @-@ sized Em@@ press enterprise , &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council .
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , who submitted sec@@ rec@@ y to investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ inen left the system construction management on the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been deb@@ ated in the discussion for months .
violent reactions among marine owners who came to the meeting called out the images and new details on the desired hotel structure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and member of the Executive Board at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge block that domin@@ ates all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears such a number of other project critics that traffic would increase sharply due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the bus loads must come so that it pays off &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly is happening on the good one hect@@ are area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches campaign donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc . ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling donations campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announ@@ cing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who had fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our trip included many dark rail and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / has doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can take at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
over the years , obesity interventions for type 2 diabetes have proven to be efficient , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and stomach tumour formation - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this surgery sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatment approximately at 29 .
among those undergoing a surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was totally dis@@ b@@ anded and at 28 % partially dissolved .
in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved by just one percent and in some cases , only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best maintained below 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c levels fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical treatment group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , according to researcher Dr Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching larger responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) , and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more severe people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with BM@@ I less than 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point in this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long for people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that as soon as they have accumulated these genetic changes that have stuck their bodies firmly with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary memorial to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader urged to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed in front of the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama engaged in Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as genuine peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and found out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence and it caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , who swallow a strong alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of in@@ comes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reporting toxic control centers reported from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children increasingly come to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them arrive in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants deliberately , while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
YouTube videos show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have supposedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with alcoholic mou@@ th@@ wash to get a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ infection products ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in small children , a few sp@@ atter can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the poison control centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky hanging around , but people leave this hand disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of fra@@ grant disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was brought to treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered to be dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ul@@ led her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of Hir@@ n trauma , because the girl had fallen by alcohol and had ki@@ cked her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ atory Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N .
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ins and store hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition to alcohol pois@@ oning , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with death cases .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after swal@@ lowing down disinf@@ ect@@ ants , containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the 4th class planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by using anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; says a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary action against the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver took the cross@@ bar towards the industrial area and realized too late that two pre @-@ driving vehicles had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he hit the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed the vehicle to a Ford Fi@@ esta .
in the event of accidents involving accidents , damages amounted to about 10,000 euros , the police for@@ ba@@ de .
the Audi of the 33 year old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Netherlands - de Bo@@ er
the former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they don &apos;t show high points of Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here are not just talking about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , Dei@@ la swe@@ ars .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss is trying to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now at the top of the table with a margin of five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel it exactly the same - but we must go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the player feel better .
to stand together is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win games of this kind either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it rises in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period from May to July , while the number of people without labour for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statisti@@ cal Office ( ON@@ S ) showed .
in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I Bec@@ oming a Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed .
as the day approached , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and since more applications are available as seats , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh much when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it could have formulated better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sy had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work of the Movement will help against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a journalist at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into details here again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would render him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really obj@@ ectively .
there will be other re@@ porters you can contact for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stayed dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to depend on the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y waters , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ anning V@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were called into a breach of peace in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them towards the C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ vec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned to a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good police officer . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car to the dit@@ ch to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a rac@@ et@@ day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cobal@@ t drop@@ out test at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he had been held back for 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too high hanging clusters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you &apos;re so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it went on .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around with up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I am trying my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be more trainers .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they evi@@ dently believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly go to their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to touch me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard K@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should I think it &apos;s going to happen in person ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps make people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say is now thinking about it now .
but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to &quot; throw out his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the failed Master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack had been applied mud or clay on the horse &apos;s strip , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it &apos;s against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was also the case .
but it was the race day as well .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this issue has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals for claims about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has called cri@@ tique of the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in the qualifying fin@@ als in Sydney on Friday night .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a barely concealed note to the Storm Team after his team scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in w@@ rest@@ ling .
Bell@@ amy defending the tac@@ kling of his team and said that they were only focused on &quot; contact &quot; in the tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading coaches at his team makes him feel confident , as it means that they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this time and again , I have not heard Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have not changed anything about our defensive system or techniques . but over the last six weeks , we have made our contact with Tac@@ kles a real focal point , and that has provided for us the turn@@ around .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . so he is probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this always appears at this time of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy attacked the idea of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with boring football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wa@@ yne talks about exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his play on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a mess .
but now he has a team that can play and that we look exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they can .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are there breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me , it &apos;s the game plans .
when they mention us it means that we will meet them in one phase .
the Storm Team released this weekend because they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the semi @-@ fin@@ als at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
bier with $ 200,000 deposit on drugs
a man who possibly threat@@ ens a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America to Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in August in Co@@ om@@ era .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
despite a possibly life @-@ long punishment for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he attempted to own the entire amount and that in the cafe would have been a harmless cause .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was worried about the danger of escape at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of $ 200,000 as security in order to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of $ 200,000 represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ uses his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports himself to the police daily and stops at a starting block from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A@@ 5 in Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab tears apart
in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 in Karlsruhe a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent building in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to switch to the left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident break@@ er tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ North was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to claim images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she slept , logging into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of this and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed against the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ le on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be an addiction , that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es .
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was ill in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl finds the news on the phone she called her mother and was in trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took use of computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to viol@@ ate the regulations on 25 January of this year and not to appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defense attorney Gregor S@@ im ple@@ dged that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as it can be argued that &quot; there is no significant sexual element &quot; in his off@@ ence .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a deposit but was held in custody due to hear@@ ings on other cases still pending .
he was taken up before the date of Jud@@ gment in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
floo@@ d@@ lights switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up outside the main control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates were caused by fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in the Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal Inn districts .
they were on foot over bridges and dam@@ s to the German side .
there they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to the registration .
according to Federal Police information , more and more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station compared to the week start on Wednesday .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 o &apos;clock in the morning , a spokes@@ man said in the morning .
after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : runner @-@ up of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air currently flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart shared .
the powerful low was the prec@@ ur@@ sor of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; who had moved from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days .
storms and thunder@@ storms are especially expected in Baden .
according to the DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake District with bows of 60 to 90 km kilometres to reck@@ on .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again .
the crowd makes it : every two years , the car makers at the IA@@ A show their innovations .
2015 is mainly moving to compact cars , which are currently selling particularly well .
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : some 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) in August alone in this segment .
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
a number of new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra will not be much more expensive .
Rüssel@@ sheim / Frankfurt . Opel provides an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect , starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16,@@ 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra boasts a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines are also included for the first time .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is already seen at the IA@@ A .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IA@@ A on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a distinc@@ tly sporty GT version .
at the beginning of next year , he also comes into trade as a com@@ bo .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan trim wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact infin@@ iti fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the DS 4 compact class model , which can be seen at the IA@@ A .
outside the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er had a hand at the front : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ painted and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otain@@ ment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
at the IA@@ A in the compact class , there are also a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the fresh@@ ened Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court ordered an ex @-@ prisoner of the Justice Det@@ ention Unit of Te@@ gel , who was accommod@@ ated for months in a small cell .
because of the violation of human dignity , prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision that was published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected may even hope for money if they were confined within close quarters only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was lod@@ ged in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man who , according to his lawyer &apos;s instructions , had meanwhile been on his free foot , had been transferred to a larger cell .
his arrest warrant , due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin , failed .
however , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Kammer@@ gericht Berlin and re@@ mitted the case to the re @-@ examination .
they see the man &apos;s dignity destroyed .
the Chamber judgment now decides on the amount of compensation
even if there were only a few days of detention for compensation for legal reasons , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a deterioration of the legal protection of the personality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Chamber Court must now clarify the amount of compensation for money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they did not speak to a prisoner in April because he was locked up naked in a cell .
according to a Dec@@ ision of 2011 , human @-@ un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe confirmed that the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 , had agreed a decent housing .
the pla@@ in@@ ti@@ ff at that time was accommod@@ ated in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case for three months between 15 and 21 hours .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel .
the det@@ ain@@ ees are therefore always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness goes up , even fights should have come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 are expected to fall away in 2016 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
according to forecasts of the German Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year , according to vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated decisi@@ vely in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Commerce ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space , however , is dramatic , above all for affordable rental objects : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units fall out of the rental price each year , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
a lot too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing units annually would have to be built , and for this the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scientists and Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Institute for Employment Research , it is estimated that 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long run .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked systematically after their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ised Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the reception society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ u@@ hardt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ u@@ ck@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise employment .
while there was previously a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the residence requirement that asylum seekers are confined to a place of residence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society , too , due to the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view prevailed , too , that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of knowledge of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
until now there is no adequate supply of general and occupational language courses .
research also shows that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
therefore , the development of networks is , in the opinion of th@@ ron@@ d@@ hardt , the royal road to work integration .
the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ da@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the management distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the demand for female participants increases sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for instance by allowing more specialised schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared in welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ages from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal state permits asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception has so far been Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student willing refugees could be made easier access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or de@@ fam@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum application law if they start studying .
the latter , in principle , do not receive any b@@ af@@ e , since they do not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ aries .
patient refugees had to live in Germany for four years so far , to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ree , from 1 January 2016 this span shortened to 15 months .
but this lack of funding must also be closed , demand Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ o@@ grams .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should gradually sweep the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state @-@ religion ratio .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of newcom@@ ers professionally .
rights belong to the rights .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to carry out such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said in the Ba@@ yr@@ ische Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will hen@@ ce@@ forth be a topic of society as a whole .
in this way , the majority society will have to change , and the reduction of discrimination and racism is more urgent .
Germany - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade .
but it slowly learns how the NS@@ U @-@ murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal opportunities for all : what migrants organizations and interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been calling for and what international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention Germany commit must become a reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their possibilities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees so far , writes Dr Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , vice @-@ president of the medical profession .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money has to flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all of the newcom@@ ers to sign up health cards right away .
services rendered could later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to cast off so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum application Act fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barriers possible .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are better informed about their illnesses than other patients .
not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices , interpre@@ ters would need to be taken over .
many refugees , however , would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
among the refugee children , there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities , and among the young people it is about HIV @-@ raising .
with some of the other illnesses German doctors come from their training but clear , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery means .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the medical sign is concerned , the refugees possibly even have relief in sight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have a highly developed educational system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Federal Psycho@@ therapy Chamber ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most people suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; particularly vulnerable are refugee children , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a recent study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rage and fears of death .
other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment was necessary , Mun@@ z declared .
up to now , however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees have been given psycho@@ therapy .
although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seekers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ical workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses will decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new production &quot; passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal thres@@ holds and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the arena on the brick .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current stage production . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more than 33 years the Circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
so , the gift to am@@ ate@@ urs is in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; almond cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 km long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from around the world .
awarded the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v c@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wit and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies it wants to take up the Cuban duo .
light@@ ness and flexibility - these words identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with intuition and ag@@ ility .
balancing on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
there is no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake @-@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little other and fascin@@ ates with her ag@@ ility .
sixty employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; stresses Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stro@@ king unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the man@@ ege .
the upper@@ most commandment therefore : good for the animals .
the family Pro@@ bst is especially proud of her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare .
the two animals lived together for eight years and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the Circus Pro@@ bst .
there might be something for every visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether five or 1 200 people , we always do our best and are with all my heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst looks at its performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 and 20 : 00 p.m .
on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is the day of the day , for the presentation at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced .
the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also imp@@ acted by alle@@ gations of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with calls .
last month , they had borrow@@ ed him and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
spokes@@ man for Democratic Change Movement ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he told journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it warns the Members of Parliament that the immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will disman@@ tle up to 30,000 jobs
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to disman@@ tle 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
HP will later divide up into two listed companies this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing enterprise hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts will lead to a burden of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard in the 1930s to manufacture electro @-@ installations and their Pal@@ o Alto garage &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the departure of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this sector based on the belief that closely focused companies deliver better performance .
arsen@@ al captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says team @-@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere surely will miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of its history , his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old swing back during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not threaten care@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had previously .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd. records 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played 15@@ 7 league players in the last five seasons of arsen@@ al .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that in six out of eight play times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two Premier League clubs that have reported most of the injury days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the injury rate will continue during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time in which you must strengthen your body and gain battle strength , &quot; said Wen@@ ger .
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to get a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Arsen@@ al &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign has started in the last season . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains of the distant hope to lead the association to his first European Cup victory with his management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked at Arsen@@ al .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Festival : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the main cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Campa@@ ign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) announced in 2015 as the year of the man , with the goal of questioning the culture that hin@@ ders men from seeking help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the fight to tackle this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends , so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication led by social media , with emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation domin@@ ates .
this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently stated , money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was put up@@ side down .
each character was defined not by his work but by his personality , which was shining through the interaction as a friend .
the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football boots in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold themselves to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a member of the telephone pastoral ministry told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My role for listening to people who are de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when you talk about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends are one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
as much as my objective out@@ sider status may help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; di Maria meets to help the PS@@ G to mal@@ enge the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Malm@@ ö &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria makes his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass on to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani continued the course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ Park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Sha@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they not only asp@@ ire to qualify for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause our opponents problems and to look back at ease , even though there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t score one or two more goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was designated as the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he indicated why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö @-@ defense before he ended up beautifully in the long corner of the network .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , beating the Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and joined a heavy opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field .
but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps P@@ aths in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G himself sometimes gave himself up , with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had p@@ atz@@ ed in the first half in no less than five attempts alone and then abandoned after re@@ bo@@ oting him .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into play , and it was a passport of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was transformed by Di Maria into a shooting that was driven by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate ended shortly after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . in doing so , the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth win , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had found a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the final result down before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi got a goal at the end .
the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualification matches are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern
world champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was apparently just a few years ago before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times Champions League winner , two times champion league champion , twice champion league , one time champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona for 24 years and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was already before the Euro 2008 before the exit from Barcelona .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the FC Bayern was registered .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 ran with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , turned the reds out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph@@ al triumph .
matt Dam@@ on is playing diversity in the film
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown in a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown canc@@ eled the need for alternative perspectives while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied themselves .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want people to think about it - who will always be the director - how to deal with the character of the Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown said initially .
the only black person , and she is a nun , beaten by her white col@@ t .
the producer of Dear White People hired Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the twe@@ ets earned more than 5000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement gained a country @-@ wide effect and urged the legislature and the authorities to stop discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured immigrants .
in February , singer Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still weaker , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be viewed as a hate group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and user support Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete to win the American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the climbing at a 75 foot long climbing rope was the last task in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard fought victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or have had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed went to the Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he was the first to finish the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it gets the great grat@@ u@@ ity .
I don &apos;t think he triumph@@ s over this .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt the same if they hadn &apos;t changed the roles .
America N@@ in@@ ja War@@ ri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting started in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ aks past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ A@@ PO@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central .
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins gave a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inside , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inner ring and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw at the bull@@ pen every game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two runs , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a good grip on the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at the ( kick training ) , clearly looked better off at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into play .
with three R@@ uns at the end of the seventh inn@@ ings , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ te , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ hand Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run escape from the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run at the second Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after adding a Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inside , the wall made a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed man , however , arrived at S@@ ano in three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from an even un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es game at the start of the game .
the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inside against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game after having been missing for more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I set off and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes handed a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game , who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the runners in the sc@@ oring position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right side , created another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers scored in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor .
he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ever right @-@ handed man A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns at six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw @-@ out training .
he was examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the injuries list because of a shoulder @-@ distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP is painted by Daniel Mor@@ ris from the vulner@@ ability list to fight against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was purchased in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games at Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to be accommod@@ ated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people of Wiesbaden will then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden shared on Tuesday evening .
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this event in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stay there .
they are then to be spread to other communities .
over the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse , according to the German Regi@@ er@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Gie@@ ßen .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , considers military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that resol@@ ute thinking on military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European countries of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective look . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement has passed to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict escal@@ ates in front of our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria again introduced controls at its southern and eastern borders .
the Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , no one was sent back to Hungary .
Germany did not send any refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it &apos;s been agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement that Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany .
she did not call concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of another 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to strengthen the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection were also compla@@ ining .
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge force exer@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that it would also tie the border to Romania with a fence .
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent smu@@ g@@ gling routes across Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants made their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds Ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the Eis@@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus a global ocean s@@ ashes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this includes researchers from observations of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore the moon stag@@ ger@@ ed slightly on its orbit around the ring plan@@ ks .
although this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sheet . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been known for some time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of Saturn already in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring of Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , astronom@@ ers then closed .
but the expansion of the hidden ocean has not been clari@@ fied .
R@@ ama is missing Munich several weeks ago
the 1860 München must give up about a month on offensive player Val@@ det R@@ ama .
an investigation has shown an infrin@@ gement of ad@@ duc@@ tor at the age of 27 , the association announced .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to Munich &apos;s lion , the diagnosis is estimated to be four weeks of forced break .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is difficult for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sport@@ director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential obligation of a free professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was also under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at currently has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his ability . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to his conc@@ ussion , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again after his conc@@ ussion .
already on Thursday the Austrian national player is supposed to get into running training .
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) at a violent clas@@ h on her head .
against the very first fears , however , he remained without a serious blin@@ king .
no fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain relatively much sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : they contain B vitamins and vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ur@@ sor beta @-@ carot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel @-@ color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then of course they taste pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives hearty dishes a special touch .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as chil@@ lies and ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .
the US parcel service U@@ PS will again provide up to € 9@@ 5000 for Christmas business in the United States .

last year , U@@ PS raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and his rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries made the parcel service harsh criticism .
first storm @-@ storm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alpine side of the F@@ öhn , it breaks through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows with storm strength through the herd si@@ res .
on Thursday morning we cross a distinctive cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a drop in temperature .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a communication , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ west flow .
on the north side of the Alps , the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys during the night .
as a result , the fo@@ eh@@ n blows until Thursday morning in the hills with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and partly in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h .
the F@@ öhn can pre @-@ enter into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains there are even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h possible .
while in the north on Wednesday blow @-@ stor@@ my fo@@ eh@@ n ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the Alp@@ ens@@ ü@@ d@@ sag starts to st@@ ow away .
here the rain starts to stop until Thursday evening .
in sum , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter must be accounted for in the next 48 hours .
on Thursday morning , the fo@@ eh@@ n gets out of the air , as a result a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east over Switzerland .
along with the cold front the wind is blowing strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures are clearly going back .
the following days show up in the north , with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees .
Rome now has a Martin Luther square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live only in secret their faith for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , it becomes visible that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a sin@@ ful sin ba@@ bel .
according to historians , his negative impressions will have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses against the aband@@ on@@ ment of the departed .
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
at the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible that has now appeared with splendid pictures .
at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 designs formul@@ ates his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 year old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite dark .
for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his Bible project , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ ther@@ land .
he has fascinated several partners spontaneously : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books .
and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the Bible passages from Ot@@ mar Alt and interpreted into the present , into current inter@@ relations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord is golden letters .
thus the 75 year old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the cataly@@ st for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up to carry myself back to the Lord &apos;s Father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to bring art back to more value in the quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is shaped by advertisement today , and it is loud .
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I always wanted to be a lover of Ot@@ mar &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t care to completely capture the Bible , but chose the topics that were important to him , including mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en your life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen wallpapers - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung .
construction start for BM@@ X rail is approaching
plans made , place found , company commissioned , earth hill for a round course model@@ ed : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finished .
sec@@ rec@@ y in politics and administration ensured dr@@ y@@ ness , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railway .
so hills de@@ ported , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval was approved in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the child and youth committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further break &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B broad@@ ens its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga is a clear sign on the weekend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; football responds to the sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures policy its help in addressing the pending problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle that nothing matters to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to every individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he will discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the Chancellor &apos;s Office next Wednesday and meet Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and will help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ensured that this programme continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the ver@@ ge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Bundes@@ liga are also supporting this program .
already this weekend , the 36 professional clubs set a clear sign when they will carry the print &quot; We Help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) instead of the usual sponsor logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen , leader Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama tells everyone , nobody can &apos;t see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can &apos;t , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim , managing director Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Championships against Hungary on this Friday .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large collective work of German football . &quot;
the fact that all 36 license associations had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B @-@ selection and the German federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called the whole amount for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses an eye in the event of an accident
according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
in the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , after midnight he had fallen on a glass of water that he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost ble@@ ated , fain@@ ted , then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can follow his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually oscill@@ ates between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up once you &apos;ve fallen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ low f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken down .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in the Du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Top@@ Game against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the high burden of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its trunk to the R@@ eus position .
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of root @-@ keeper Roman natur@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the soccer instructor praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be deployed in all Europe @-@ league games in the future , Tu@@ ck@@ les has left open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl aims to make the final statement by fellow players R@@ eus that the final move to the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants to lead role for Germany
according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , fores@@ ees investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t talked about a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new Mobility Age &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Frankfurt at the edge of the IA@@ A fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide for less traffic , said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , who also come together with industry representatives at the IA@@ A .
the strategic paper of the Ministry of Transport , among other things , emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid growth on digital radio .
for testing new technology , there is currently a test track on the Autobahn 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are applied to the driver , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use it internationally to increase the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only envis@@ aged the human being as a driver . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are to be expected &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far ahead of 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to some EUR 8.@@ 4 billion appreciate the value added in the driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than Fren@@ ch@@ men or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the investig@@ for@@ gan@@ ization Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect it in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all .
in France , 21 percent of the inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es are counting up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the United States 33 percent .
drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
after a survey of the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
at least 15 per cent of the traffic could be present on the motorway , in the traffic jams lasting 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l proposes te@@ amm@@ ing- and double @-@ start at table tennis @-@ EM

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to win the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected back on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the disadvantage is that we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ gen in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded of the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo had also lack@@ ed and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look sc@@ ary human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star in the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and so that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I can no longer say that I am the en@@ f@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18th September at Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his le@@ aning posture to a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually , he had been against it because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously taken place in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk that was used for a lot of effort : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have spent 14 tons of material on their way to Munich .
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leder@@ h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can also be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ inous fashion attempts by the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion by himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them but of course .
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
they got nothing but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ en tip as fashion ni@@ ches
in the past it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meter .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and spi@@ kes were produced in a large quantity for customers who , for example , processed them for blankets and she@@ ers .
this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the early days of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ ti@@ lindustrie - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and for regional costumes .
at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , borrow@@ ed from past bites , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already make up half of all orders .
together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery .
only they must wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
private specialist shops and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and are driven almost exclusively by chains .
in addition , exports are weaker , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the US .
enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that need to think economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly different in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ discovered the historic snow@@ ball point .
in doing so , the machine bu@@ cks small balls in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before I could not do anything with traditional pl@@ um lace . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball tip for her jewelry .
in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of pl@@ um lace - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
thus I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador to the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans a new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney is still vent@@ uring into a new movie of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it is not about a re @-@ movie but a kind of continuation , which takes 20 years after the first film with the magical children &apos;s girl .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already certain : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to gradually expand outward to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group charged with the reform of reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; said Xi .
the management group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is of great importance as it as@@ signs the market a greater role in allocation of resources , guarantees a rule of law and is more open to the market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment will be opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; Green Card &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process .
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting .
at the meeting also attended Premier Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and help consumers to dose a significantly higher dose of toxins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a member of the EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and infants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , are to be lifted from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish .
large predat@@ ory fish , however , are today so strongly polluted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able .
according to F@@ ood@@ watch , in exchange for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to exac@@ erb@@ ate the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they already comply with the expected maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction which helps the economy alone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal , highly toxic to the human being , which is strongly enriched over the food chain in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore cau@@ tions that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small amounts are especially capable of causing damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry stated on its website with regard to the current maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is driven mainly by the burning of coal into the environment .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , German coal @-@ fired power plants attract more than six tons of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , is &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from paper in March .
throughout Europe , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
