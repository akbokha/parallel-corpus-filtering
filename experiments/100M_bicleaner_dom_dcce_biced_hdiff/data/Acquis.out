&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case , the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again be applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the organization is held on the ongoing basis by the total quantity and composition of the material in question in the respective state or the countries concerned and on any passing of such material from this state or state .
this explains their agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as time and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a approval or a knowledge of the military activity , and does not refer to the use of the core material .
the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in their respective obligations under this Convention .
if the community , the states or persons who are subject to their sovereignty , however , extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs , provided that it has clari@@ fied in advance .
in any case , the organization carries the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization .
the Community and States ensure that civil liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations , to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same way as on the nationals of the States .
any claim that the community or state against the organization or the organization in relation to the community or a state due to damage - with the exception of damages resulting from a nuclear incident - which resulted from the implementation of the security measures pursuant to this Convention , is governed in accordance with international law .
after examining the relevant information submitted to him by the Director General , that the organization must not be able to pass through verification , that no core material , which must be subject to safety measures pursuant to this Convention , can be reimbur@@ sed for nuclear weapons or other nuclear missi@@ les if necessary , and if necessary take the other measures envis@@ aged there .
in such steps , the Council , in which mass has been acquired by the applied security measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two parties is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security .
upon request of the Organization , Community or State , consultations are held on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the state concerned to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
with the exception of disputes , a statement made by the Council in accordance with Article 19 or any of the measures adopted by the Council are disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation path or by another procedure agreed upon by the Organization , the Community and the States to submit to an arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal composed of five arbitr@@ ators .
the Community and the States design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators named shall elect a fifth who heads the presi@@ dency .
if the Community and the States or the organization have not designated two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators .
the same procedure shall apply if within thirty days of the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
the resolutions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned .
a ) This Convention shall be noted for non @-@ nuclear parties , the contracting party of the contract and members of the Community , in force , i ) when the State of the Organization specifies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention .
II ) if the community of the organization is not@@ ing that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this Convention .
a ) The organization , the community and the states seek each other to seek one of the Parties about a change of this Convention .
B ) All changes require the consent of the organization , the community and the states .
C ) The Director @-@ General shall promptly inform all Member States of the organization of any amend@@ ment of this Convention .
a ) This Convention enters into force on the day that the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification that their procedures for entry into force are concluded .
B ) This agreement will remain in force as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the agreement is to determine the procedure as required in the execution of the provisions of part I on securing measures .
the objective of the security measures defined in this Convention is the timely detection of the det@@ ri@@ ment of significant quantities of nuclear activities for nuclear weapons and other nuclear activities for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence from such a junction by the risk of early detection .
in order to reach the target determined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , f@@ ading with spatial input and observation as important supple@@ mental measures .
the technical completion of the audit by the organisation is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity for each material balance zone specified for a certain period of time is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified bat@@ ches .
in carrying out their follow @-@ up examinations , the Organization shall make full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Core Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a structure in material balance zones .
in the application of their preventive measures , the community will make use of de methods and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and are useful :
a ) a measuring system for the determination of quantities of preserved , lost , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the stock and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Proced@@ ures for the determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
e ) procedures to evaluate the accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and not measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and report system that indicates the core material inventory for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
g ) arrangements which ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures pursuant to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or in ore processing .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under letter c ) , is introduced into the States , thus dividing the organization of the organization the quantity and composition of the material provided it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) leaves core material which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or is introduced into the states in a later phase of the core fuel circle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , the community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to the agreement under this agreement , is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues , so consult the organisation and the community on the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions outlined in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
at the request of the Community , the organisation releases the following core material from the securing measures pursuant to the Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in gram@@ mes or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities under Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
at the request of the Community , the organization exemp@@ ts core material that would otherwise be subject to securing measures pursuant to this Convention , provided that the total material amount delivered in the States at no point in time is more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special flamm@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the fi@@ v@@ ef@@ old square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liber@@ ated core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this agreement , precau@@ tions for the re @-@ application of the securing measures are made on that material .
the community meets with the organisation supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope , which is necessary for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention , in detail as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention shall apply .
the supple@@ mental agreements may be extended or changed without amend@@ ment of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supple@@ mental agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can enter into force within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires the mutual agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62 of the initial report , the organisation sets up a summari@@ zed inventory of the underlying core material in the States , irrespective of its origin , and carries on this inventory as a result of the subsequent reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program defined at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by general resource @-@ transfer problems .
C ) The objective of the EEC and Member States is that the total contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC laid down a table that is to be seen in what way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement ;
the organization establishes a special account under the name &quot; Dep@@ os@@ it@@ ory Account &quot; which is made up of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to as &quot; Man@@ age &quot; by the organization , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes issued by the Member State to pay upon request in the currency of the respective state at Order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker at the agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time , which was agreed between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker taking into account the periods necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) Any Member State may , upon request , make payments on the above @-@ mentioned dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator reserves approximately proportional hol@@ dings on the cash or the school j@@ unk to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to equ@@ alize the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in granting such loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan terms without delay ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly paid development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the organisation &apos;s loan programme or not , according to the procedures and practices that are considered , approved and administr@@ ated for the funds funded by the Organization ( letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the Special Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory Account may not be used instead of regular funds from the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has been approved as part of a loan or credit for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally valid for the organization granted by the Organization ; therefore , they are re@@ payable in 50 years at ten free @-@ years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this bi@@ ble are to be paid directly to the organization that retains them .
each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which the source of funds is specifically indicated .
the proceeds from any special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted , could be recipients of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of a special transaction loan are eff@@ ected on the special transaction account , and the amount returned in the currency of a member state is to be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned .
until full disclosure of all special transaction loans , the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC concerning the projects and programmes approved by the directors for testing by the directors .
during the period of the payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator noti@@ fies the EEC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this purpose .
as soon as possible , the administrator noti@@ fies the EE@@ A as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organisation , a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tors of the organization for this account completion .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EW@@ G transm@@ its a detailed account of the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States .
the EEC and the Administrator are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator through to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programs or projects financed through special transactions , and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , the EEC and the Organisation did not enter into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be invalid with immediate effect .
in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to Member States , the total amount of the total amount of all eligible loans in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement shall be terminated and all obligations of the parties resulting from it are terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States inform the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat shall forward these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication of the Reg@@ ular Appro@@ val of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications at the organization .
this agreement is contained in two tran@@ scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , each word is equally authentic .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN nuclear group , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and THE Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Federal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this program includes the creation of a large experimental facility called J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , the construction and operation of a common company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gemein@@ sames J@@ ET &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been working with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
as far as the practical use of the controlled nuclear fusion is still to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to sum up their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary overl@@ aps and to accelerate their respective research , which have reached a higher priority level due to the energy crisis -
this agreement is intended to emp@@ ower every contracting party to benefit from unnecessary overl@@ aps by merging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the resources provided for bilateral research work , i.@@ e . the cost @-@ wise competitive electric power generation by using controlled nuclear fusion reaction , faster .
to reach the target of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as Eur@@ atom Programme and &quot; Swiss Program . &quot;
in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over the long @-@ term goals and forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom Programme ; it is extended or changed after examination by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that it may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom programme .
every time the parties accept a new programme , this will take place in the place of the programmes listed in An@@ nex I and II to the present agreement .
the association fores@@ een in paragraph 1 will be realised through : - appropriate participation of any of the Parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
- Exchange of personnel under the respective laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and the third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third countries , &quot; as well as the laboratories working on the Eur@@ atom programme ;

with the same objective Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland , at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , particip@@ ates in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot;
in view of the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland , at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement , belongs to the Common Company J@@ ET whose by@@ laws it accepts .
further Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can contract partners of any contract whose purpose falls within the scope of the present agreement , excluding association contracts or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement .
the bodies charged with carrying out the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 of 1 of the present Cov@@ en@@ ant are described in Article 5 to 10 of this Agreement and in the Association Agreement .
the association agreement in particular must include the suspension of a steering committee , the representative of the Commission and the Federal Council .
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the best possible results in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Switzerland is represented by at most two delegates in the connection group deployed within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme - herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VG &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the VG , who has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom Programme , perc@@ ei@@ ves this task in terms of all research and development activities relating to this agreement .
it particularly supports co @-@ operation and coordination between the affiliated organs and alig@@ ns its T * gener@@ osity in the interests of both contracting parties to the common objective specified in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme , as well as the common goal defined in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are du@@ ly taken into account .
in accordance with its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG will appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the Eur@@ atom programme whenever the relevant Swiss authorities seek .

&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s agreement with the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobil@@ isation of the demands of the Member States in the medium @-@ term financial advisory board
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks submit a corresponding application .
the agreement could be closed to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total amount of EUR 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion ; this corresponds to 50 % of all the future delivery funds of the member countries .
however , some conditions have already been mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , without exceeding five years .
in the event of the opening of the loans as well as their possible extension , BI@@ S would charge a credit bill .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first dra@@ fts were not made before the exp@@ iry of one month after the conclusion of the stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the BI@@ S , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would take into account the resources of the Bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those made by the BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would correspond largely to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds even on the market , the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the corresponding margin increased by the corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks submit a corresponding application . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I honor to propose that if your government can agree to the above , this letter and your reply will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I honor to tell you that my government can agree to the above and that your letter and reply will form an agreement according to your suggestion .
in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Eastern Uruguay on Trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb meat
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations concerning the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat by the Community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat ( F@@ are point 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( F@@ are point 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined by the Community on the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay ple@@ dges to ensure that the quantity delivered actually does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out according to traditional quot@@ ations ( frozen or ch@@ illed ) .
if a change in the offer form is possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other prior to introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under No. 10 in order to find a suitable solution .
in the event that the community takes the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to the Community market regulated by this agreement is not affected .
in the event that the imports from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the respective year .
the Community under@@ takes to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products covered by this agreement on a set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
when new Member States are joined , the Community will change with Uruguay the amount set under number 2 according to the scope of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import burdens for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the ho@@ ck set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned under number 5 is taken into account .
the total amount mentioned in number 2 is set at 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight with the day of the Greek accession to the Community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development that could affect the marketing of Urugu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the collective market within the agreed quantities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in particular , the community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of intervention stocks of frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation of Urugu@@ ay@@ an artistic conduct .
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other promotion measures for the export of sheep and lamb as well as slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs are only at prices and conditions that comply with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement .
Uruguay guarantees compliance with this agreement in particular by giving export lic@@ ences specified in this Agreement for the products referred to under Number 1 .
the Community is obliged in its turn to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import licenses for the above @-@ mentioned products with origin in Uruguay is made dependent upon the submission of an export licence , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in addition , in implementing provisions , the competent ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community is informed in regular intervals the quantities for which export lic@@ ences have been granted ; this information may be de@@ cryp@@ ted according to country of destination if necessary .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of the Republic of Uruguay on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at that time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party , to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be reviewed by the two parties prior to April 1 , 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s agreement with this letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to consoli@@ date H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations the two parties are agreed as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance stated on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) hem@@ oly@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium by dil@@ uting the re@@ agent to be examined .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest di@@ lution di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the blood cells flow in the total volume .
in the case of anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organization has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as the complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters who are observed with individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ fi@@ cities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of th@@ inners with er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter shows the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent compared to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International units ( See Bul@@ letin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you return it to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ eren , according to definition , contain 256 international units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparison of the international standard anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2@@ B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents stated on the label is determined according to the results of the durability test ; it is approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent authority of the state may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic as long as the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein @-@ nitrogen per ml of flu@@ e or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re@@ activation , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for international exchange for blood @-@ group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored as far as possible , at least until an international agreement has been established through a unified system .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents spent are stored in the laboratory for a long time until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant or mineral origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids for strengthening the effectiveness and maintenance of the re@@ agent &apos;s stability .
for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin or that animal or plant re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin .
on each container a black or white printed label can be attached in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the quantity or , in dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ plen@@ ishment ,
in addition , the label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located , or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,

however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on con@@ sign@@ ments , the relevant authorities may , however , fores@@ ee that the conveying capacity for the export and the method of delivery can be reached on one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies provided for these cases .
in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities appro@@ ve as far as possible thereof that the information contained in the copies of the application in the individual proced@@ ural phases of the application agree .
( 1 ) To ensure smooth goods traffic between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries oppose each other or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
