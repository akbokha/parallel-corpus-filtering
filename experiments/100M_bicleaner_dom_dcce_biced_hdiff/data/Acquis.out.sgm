<seg id="23">At least every three years, from the entry into force of the agreement, the Mixed Commission takes on a redesign of the list in order to take account of the entries and matches taken now.</seg>

<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program defined at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to help meet the immediate need of individual countries with low income, whose development is hampered by general resource-transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) The objective of the EEC and Member States is that the total contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other on the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the central ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC laid down a table that is to be seen in what way it intends to apply the criteria set out in this Agreement;</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization establishes a special account under the name "Depository Account" which is made up of the funds that the Member States will contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement; this account is referred to as "Manage" by the organization, and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment is made in the form of cash or non-interest notes issued by the Member State to pay upon request in the currency of the respective state at Order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment is made in two installments (i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker at the agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time, which was agreed between the EEC and the caretaker taking into account the periods necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Any Member State may, upon request, make payments on the above-mentioned dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator reserves approximately proportional holdings on the cash or the school junk to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to equalize the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In granting such loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors according to the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) of the composition and the tendency of the debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan terms without delay; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the scope in which the problems of the countries concerned are governed by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly paid development program or project (including a sectoral project), irrespective of whether it belongs to the organisation's loan programme or not, according to the procedures and practices that are considered, approved and administrated for the funds funded by the Organization (letter b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the Special Repository Account may not be used instead of regular funds from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which has been approved as part of a loan or credit for a program or project, which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally valid for the organization granted by the Organization; therefore, they are repayable in 50 years at ten free-years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this bible are to be paid directly to the organization that retains them.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which the source of funds is specifically indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from any special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are produced or provided in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, according to what the administrator has specified at the time of loan granted, could be recipients of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of a special transaction loan are effected on the special transaction account, and the amount returned in the currency of a member state is to be remitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full disclosure of all special transaction loans, the caretaker teaches the EEC concerning the projects and programmes approved by the directors for testing by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the period of the payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator notifies the EEC four times a year on the development of the special transaction loans and the expenses made for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible, the administrator notifies the EEA as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organisation, a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external auditors of the organization for this account completion.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EWG transmits a detailed account of the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and carries out appropriate records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid to the account and the amounts paid to the account and the repayments to the Member States.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the Administrator are working closely to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator through to the full issue of the means of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas on the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programs or projects financed through special transactions, and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978, or at a later date, the EEC and the Organisation did not enter into force, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting therefrom shall be invalid with immediate effect.</seg>
