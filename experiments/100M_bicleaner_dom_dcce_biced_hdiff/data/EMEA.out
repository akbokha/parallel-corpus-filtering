this document is a summary of the European Public Safety Reporting Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
if you need further information about your illness or treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like further information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of fusion tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Thin@@ k and Spe@@ ak , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal mood ) alternating with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral intake of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution to intake or the melting tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time as abili@@ fy as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
this interfer@@ es with the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter , to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize brain activity , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ rence .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent the onset of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , suffering from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence in 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in patients &quot; symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to treatment .
the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the enam@@ el tablets and the solution for insertion .
in the two studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than the patients who received a placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of the five short term studies .
in addition Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo for the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
generic Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo for the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controlled strain ) , acute ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes were consistent with the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in addition , the committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. for the placing of abili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily independent of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven even though individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic conditions and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after alternating an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transition disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient with Abi@@ li@@ fy , it should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or to break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with aria pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response for un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with aria pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective drugs with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study involving healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reduc@@ ers should be made .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites may result in a common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites .
if you consider the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , the potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ hibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reduc@@ ers should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in the amount of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ yl@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ acryl@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
because of the insufficient data situation in humans and due to the concerns originated in the animal reproduction studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ ic , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with op@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption - In a controlled study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 17.@@ 6 % for those taking lithium @-@ ion treatment .
in the long @-@ term preservation phase for more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with aria pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and no deaths .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is no information on the effectiveness of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 , for alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy volunteers , the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and in the put@@ sch .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , in week 52 , the proportion of respon@@ der patients who retained a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was significantly reduced by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an effective efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed an efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
moreover , in week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic signs , which partially were not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension period of more than 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo in the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , which cataly@@ zes N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination of complications is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l for extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at nearly 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , as did the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a pop@@ up @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no evidence of clin@@ ically significant differences in terms of eth@@ ni@@ city affili@@ ation or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent subsidiary kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al cor@@ tex @-@ carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al cor@@ on@@ ary carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral administration of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study of 39 weeks in the g@@ all of monkeys and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of 3 and 11 times the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which comprised 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of 3 and 11 times the average Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution should be terminated and commen@@ ced using the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle by circum@@ vent@@ ing adi@@ p@@ ous regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see Section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the medication to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution for insertion .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see Section 4.5 ) .
the safety and efficacy of the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , transition disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant drugs ) or hypertension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies that lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports about dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and indications of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sie , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in relation to wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15@@ mg dose ) were used intra@@ muscul@@ arly and who simultaneously received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites , compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabol@@ ites , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar can reduc@@ ers should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be increased to the dose level before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) received intra@@ muscular , the intensity of se@@ d@@ ation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following adverse events occurred more often in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were considered as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see Section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study of over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those taking lithium @-@ ion treatment .
in the long @-@ term preservation phase for more than 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , in general temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ p@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and about their occurrence also reported in the treatment with aria pra@@ z@@ ole include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desired cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole Inj@@ ection Solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant increase in the symptoms of ap@@ athy and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am reference arm .
the average recovery from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe toxic@@ ity , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant increase in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , in week 52 , the proportion of respon@@ der patients who followed a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rates showed a significantly stronger improvement than at hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decrease in the rate of return , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo .
in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , comprised of 3@@ 14 patients and in which primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was significantly less patients a gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . ) .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic signs , which partially were not on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a study extension of 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to placebo in the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is 90 % greater than the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the average time until reaching the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated well by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated administration during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity according to intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human@@ oid exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent subsidiary kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in adren@@ al @-@ state carcin@@ omas and combined adren@@ al @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to expos@@ ures of 3 and 11 times the middle steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which formerly had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other drugs to reduce the side effects ) .
overall , in the main study , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if only the patients who were treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference in the efficacy Indi@@ cators , such as time to deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast to these indicators , patients who had previously received other treatments from their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines .
it should also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in their blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that in contrast to other medicines containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in patients who have failed first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or serious sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the following series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 , the treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached to degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate doses of dosage recommendations in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were conducted and there is currently no adequate data to recommend dose adjustments in patients with impaired ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data about safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
no re @-@ Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated in the patients until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven , cardiac events in the inde@@ xed patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in patients after the injection of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating methods .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is essential .
women of child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised against a sperm conservation before treatment because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the transport capability and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most significant adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma who were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III clinical trial once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( in 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows adverse events associated with the dosage of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic de@@ hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , elevated blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood of heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules that promotes the formation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ular inde@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and within the framework of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is believed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ sion @-@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated through the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and , due to the alb@@ um@@ in protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ tional protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) occurs a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by 106 patients in two single @-@ armed , un@@ affiliated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma over 30 minutes .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , who received a mono@@ therapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had chemotherapy alone , 40 % only because of metastatic disease and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 . the results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for clin@@ ching bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 were determined in clinical studies .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous dosage of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic distribution and / or crossover network of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dose ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , there are only a few data available for patients at the age of 75 , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medical drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood don@@ or is not possible before the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is displayed .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood don@@ ors , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or super@@ visor , provided that they have received an appropriate instruction .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency or because the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was inj@@ ected into which it enables the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
in the course of a trial with 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medical drug .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before they either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the period of assessment in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed spra@@ yed under the skin were studied with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients treated to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as those patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , the patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , p@@ ung@@ ent mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces Ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages to healthcare professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ inal Products P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG a approval for the marketing of Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas , or multiple my@@ el@@ oma , which receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ emia at the onset of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger operative operations , which require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood for women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
to reduce foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be used before a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and total illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
an increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values may be observed in a patient over or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding can management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the sustained ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dosage is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest approved dose required for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ a@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with an initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with an initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times per week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should be done in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and subsequent appearing can vary depending on age , gender and total illness ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor .
in view of this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding can management should be tried to achieve the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has risen by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ zy@@ te value of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l over the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .

if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / kg ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) three times a week after further 4 weeks of treatment , the dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the initial deposit of ≥ 4 blood cells is required , should receive ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice a week before the surgical procedure .
iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program begins - large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention as well as 4 days immediately thereafter .
alternatively , injection at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug in the circulation .
patients who are diagnosed with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ tin at er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
in patients who are unable to participate in a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently acquired heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as a reduction in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the common causes of non @-@ contact ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminum toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes &quot; Index ) , is low ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0,5 % ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of loss of action is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefits that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control sei@@ zur@@ es and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended under Section 4.2 .
according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which is not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
for tumor patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account ( patients who may need to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded as 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted according to Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic occur@@ ren@@ ces ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the goal of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment with the involvement of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients with greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly before the onset of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
patients who undergo a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events may occur in patients with an initial hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival in tumor patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumour tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
over th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , trans@@ it@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic thro@@ mb@@ oses , ap@@ eur@@ y@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , as well as patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent rise in blood pressure or deterioration of an existing hypertension .
an increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins .
regardless of the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment , patients with cardiovascular disease may undergo repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications .
the technologi@@ cally won epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ side and in terms of the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content is identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression has been studied in five major controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and control patients .
in these studies , patients with an an@@ a@@ emia associated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ explained statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate than with controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and in controls .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ical events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results can be transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients were included with these characteristics in the examined data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated IV application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and might be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approximately 20 times the recommended daily dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to a reduced f@@ ö@@ tal body weight , a delay in the oscill@@ ation and an increase in fet@@ al mortality .
these reports rely on in vitro findings with cells from human tumour tissue samples that are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation .

during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets , which re@@ forms in further treatment .
your doctor may regularly perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dissolution of red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be taken into account and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed prior to treatment .
very rarely was reported about the occurrence of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast alert , it will break down your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value could be the risk of having problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium levels , your doctor may consider interruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in normal range .
if you suffer from chronic ren@@ al weakness and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ emia in adults with chronic ren@@ al weakness ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which is not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 doctor will regularly determine your blood pigment values ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of blood cl@@ ots ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you are an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are cancer patient , bear in mind that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act as a growth factor for blood cells and , under certain circumstances , can adver@@ sely affect the tumour .
if you have a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
if your red blood pigment values ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease which makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a low trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the case of H@@ inf@@ ant ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) prior to first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms occurring in the three days following the in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material was used for the assessment by Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 older women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of verteb@@ ral and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of efficacy was whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase content in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood returned to norm@@ alized or at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of ed@@ dy frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
in comparison to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis treatments ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most Ac@@ la@@ sta side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta producer provides information on doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ sta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the drug side effects are explained and indicated as to when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s placing in the European Union .

treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after the treatment of the hom@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get sufficient intake of calcium , correspon@@ dingly twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen .
patients with kidney function ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended because limited clinical experiences are available for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) are not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in elderly patients is similar to younger ones .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age , as data is lacking for safety and efficacy .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , as limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with ac@@ la@@ sta by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
because of the quick insertion of the effect of hydro@@ flu@@ oric acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , the maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , respectively twice daily at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see Section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene ) should be studied before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment .
no data is available for patients who need dental intervention , whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw region .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( see Section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of cases of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation reported as serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in table 1 .
kidney function Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ent was associated with kidney function disorders , which were linked to kidney function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ( measured every year before administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure and a reduced kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the Ac@@ la@@ stage and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta up to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) were found in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received supple@@ mental amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see Section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recent frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of acet@@ ates ( see Section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after administration of hydro@@ flu@@ oric acid in a large clinical study reported local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area was supp@@ ressed , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental procedures .
7 Pati@@ ents with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area of one with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a patient treated with placebo .
in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 to 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ al ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric ed@@ dy frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ la@@ sta treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed an equally lasting effect over three years , resulting in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase of bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the knee @-@ neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius at 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic ridge .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume in the patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study duration .
the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose Ac@@ la@@ sta reduced B@@ SAP significantly after 12 months by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
the vitamin D mirrors were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50.000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before the in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment in comparison to placebo treatment increased BM@@ D on total sc@@ ents and scar@@ ves at all times .
over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % to the total plant and by 4.3 % at the cas@@ hier .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT trial 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( Study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was studied in patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mainly mild to moder@@ ately heavy mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2 @-@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of te@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily for 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline value for Ac@@ la@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 with Ac@@ la@@ sta and the 107 treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients treated with ac@@ la@@ sta , compared with 71 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , was maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minute in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients resulted in the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent .
after that , the plasma concentration decreased rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic van@@ ishing from the large cycle with half @-@ life times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimin@@ atory phase with a terminal elim@@ ination quarter of ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is independent of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the zinc acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the area under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a decreased clearance of met@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because it is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) , cor@@ related with the carcin@@ ogen@@ in clearance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 m@@ L / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function breakdown down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the cit@@ ric acid .
since severe kidney dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) contains only limited data , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in the case of trials in dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C were six times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous and chronic toxic@@ ity In trials with intraven@@ ous application the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents in rats was administered in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the triple of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in accumulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site occurred .
the most frequent case in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
at rats , a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ eity of dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg was observed as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such a skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels .

according to the CH@@ MP directive on risk management systems for human medicines , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • When new information is known that could influence the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activity to minim@@ ise the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days when an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a representative of a class that is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
declining blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forcing the bone .
if you are undergoing dental treatment or undergoing dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have taken it recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are using medicines , which are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , be sure to take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip outbreak .
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if you missed the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , please contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new appointment .
before starting treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please check your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very common ( with more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less frequent following subsequent in@@ fu@@ sions .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw@@ s were mainly reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates due to other diseases .
about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not listed in this utility information .
if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to perform the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of acet@@ ates , patients must be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important for patients receiving a di@@ ure@@ tic treatment .
because of the quick insertion of the effect of hydro@@ flu@@ oric acid on bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia may develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of ac@@ la@@ sta .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get adequate intake of calcium , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently experienced low @-@ trau@@ matic frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ates .

in addition , four studies were conducted in more than 7 000 patients , in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used in comparison to a placebo as a suppor@@ tive remedy for setting smoking .
on the other hand , the studies on the attitude of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were nausea and infections of upper respiratory tissues .
it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts among others .

abstract of the EP@@ AR@@ A for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Safety Reporting Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) assessed the studies carried out to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , in which Met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
it can also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) , which cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be retained with the onset of the acet@@ ate treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin is to be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was examined in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tos resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced in doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional injection of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin showed a decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was investigated in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos additionally to insulin had decreased H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ vascular ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in ( in the sole use ) as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in which Met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for placing an account in the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , v@@ aul@@ ted and spread on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately terminated with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or in@@ compatibility ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application is not recommended in this age group .
in patients who are endangered by the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. past heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed with signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed with signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and previously existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency reports , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , upper abdom@@ en discomfort , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by the clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters are pre@@ occupied .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be caused by fat deposits and in some cases associated with fluid retention .
as a consequence of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction of mean ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
as a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or as a two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or degradation of a diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescri@@ bing doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report on disturbances of visual acuity ; an appropriate ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures decreased at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be dismissed ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies on drug interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insulin resistance in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
very frequent &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( from this data cannot be estimated ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T An@@ sti@@ ege was often similar to three times the upper limit of the normal range , but more rarely than in comparison groups under Met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ n@@ ite .
in an outcome study in patients with pre@@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported about con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients was performed in groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups .
in the trial period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures decreased at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for more than four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days had no symptoms .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose levels in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has continued over two years to investigate the time to follow the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years after onset of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ xis ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were adequately dis@@ continued despite three months of optimisation with insulin were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabe@@ tics for 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo a reduction of overall plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol levels as well as slightly but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel .
in comparison to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol levels found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while values lower than met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ xis were observed .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both over an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ patient study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised to receive either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly res@@ or@@ bed , with top concentrations of unchanged Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to the efficacy in roughly three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ IV is minim@@ ally pronounced .
in interaction studies , it has been proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or drug dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma @-@ elim@@ ination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance of the mother animal ent@@ ailed in the gest@@ ation decreases , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) were induced in the rat .
in an animal model of family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ons resulted in increased incidence of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of more than 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures decreased at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ xis have been studied .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both over an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study missed the target of its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are associated with taking pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and of more than 7,@@ 400 patients who received comparative medication , there was an increased incidence of frac@@ tures in women .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was tested in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels were reduced to a similar degree as with another human@@ oid .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood sugar ( the full list is to be found in the package delivery ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weighed against the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a permit for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane on the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a rapid initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar regulation has improved significantly , for example , by intensified insulin therapy , can perceive hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , type of insulin ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA opposite insulin of animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane , this can be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a switch from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling across a number of time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the treatment and ask his patients always to ask for other medicines taken by them .
4 . hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es , and with temporary or permanent brain function disorders and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Periph@@ er@@ als neu@@ rop@@ athy The rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with complaints that are called acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 . intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar regulation can , however , be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
diseases of the skin and sub@@ cut@@ aneous tissue Gel@@ der@@ eal - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur if failed to change the insertion points within the injection area .
general illnesses and complaints at the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur .
diseases of the immune system Occ@@ a@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , per@@ spir@@ ation , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ eur@@ ot@@ ic ede@@ ma , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and fain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia may , however , develop gradually : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by oral intake of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should always have grape sugar@@ s , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias involving un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a weigh@@ ted auxiliary person or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with rapid or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sion ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by spl@@ itting is active .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated injection , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
it is recommended to leave the temperature of the insulin at room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ p@@ ated according to the instructions for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions following a switch from animal to human insulin reported that early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
it is also necessary to adjust the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
if two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the quickly acting insulin must first be absorbed , followed by the amount of insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary at first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across a number of time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) may occur .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients , who underwent major surgical procedures , reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration is about 7 to 8 hours .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and teen@@ ager ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited , but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : • When you inj@@ ure too much insulin , if you eat too little or have a meal , if you are more than otherwise physically strict
let the sealing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Let ready p@@ ens always set up when it is not in use to protect it from light .
remove the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Do always use a new injection needle to avoid contamination . • Rem@@ ove the protective flap from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • tigh@@ ten the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( figure A ) • Drag the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle up • Take a few times with your finger lightly against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will accumulate in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge . while the injection needle continues upwards , press the button in the direction of the arrow ( Figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues upwards , press the button in it ( figure C ) • Now you have to stream a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Connect the cap back on the finished pen so that the digit 0 stands opposite the dosing stamp ( figure D ) • Check if the push button is pressed completely .
if the button cannot move freely , it is pressed from the injection needle . the scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the push @-@ button moves outward , while you turn the cap off • The scale below the push@@ button ( push@@ button scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Note the highest number you can see on the press scale • Ad@@ ding the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , simply turn the cap forwards or backwards until you have set the correct number of units .
turn them until the push button is at the bottom and you will notice a resistance . then take the cap off and put it on that the 0 of the metering brand is opposite .
make sure to press the button only during injection . press the button after the injection thoroughly until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You can not set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge - you can use the balance scale to estimate how much insulin is still left , but you cannot use it to adjust or select your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients showing signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or lymp@@ h no@@ des ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine crystals that may lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to take other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t , as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to that of a placebo ( placebo ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol for a year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily took 120 mg taken a urine acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ an@@ ium deposits ( including one out of the medical history known or currently available in the case of rheum@@ atism and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum pole seal is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully studied ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents , since there are no experiences with children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recept@@ ors Sin@@ ce there are no experiences with transplan@@ t recipients , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ essing treatments , an acute attack may occur during treatment , because the lowering of serum acid levels may initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han &apos;s syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine can increase in rare cases as far as it occurs in the ur@@ inary tract .
during Phase 3 clinical trials slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before commen@@ cing the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s and in the further course depending on the clinical findings ( see Section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ was did not conduct interactions with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg twice daily was associated with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient required at the same time .
in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ atum , indicating a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , slow@@ ed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and caused a decrease of the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be ruled out on the side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be assured that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the total f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ory group in pi@@ vot@@ al study of phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could stand in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below .
diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In the clinical trials , no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long term extension studies , 9@@ 06 patients have been treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients for up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally .
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in pi@@ vot@@ al studies phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hypertension and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the beginning of study ( bas@@ eline ) of ≤ 1.5 mg / dl or 100 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the start of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used dos@@ ages Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conventional used dose of allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the lowering of serum acid levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum supple@@ mentation &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al function restriction The AP@@ EX trial evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al function restriction ( ie ) .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was the primary efficacy end@@ point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum di@@ aph@@ rag@@ m concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data gathered in the Open Exten@@ ded Study of Phase 3 demonstrated that the permanent decrease of serum levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against rheum@@ atism in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not require treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the gyp@@ sum , which resulted in a complete disappearance of the top marks by month 24 in 54 % of patients .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients receiving Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at to administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 μ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum acid concentration was observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant via the concentration width which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s showed that these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ us@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose in the urine was found to be unchanged fluor@@ escence ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 30 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool found itself as imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by approximately the 1.8 times of 7.5 μ seb@@ h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney @-@ by@@ s@@ lation function .
12 Li@@ ver restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
no significant changes were observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger patients .

these findings are considered as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ metabol@@ isation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
in high doses , which were approximately in the case of 4.3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was reduced , accompanied by a decrease in the increase capacity and a develop@@ mental delay in the offspring of rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder in which the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already being used separately in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than in those who took only al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also stipul@@ ated that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is equivalent to the dose needed for the prevention of bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( digestive disorders ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) and sour upset .
in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it should not be applied in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium level ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit for the merger of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the entire European Union to the Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should only be swal@@ lowed with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth because there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ cus , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can only be given special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al frac@@ tures , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate potential es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be cau@@ tioned when symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ bul@@ ating heart@@ burn or new or wor@@ m@@ dying heart@@ burn drugs and seek medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or if symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation persi@@ sts .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was found , ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men predominantly contains intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed that they should take the tablet the next morning while consuming a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled weekly day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before starting treatment .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials along with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinical relevant interactions occurring .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but was also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , the serum cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
an oral over@@ dose may cause hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
Col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D@@ 3 ) vitamin D@@ 3 is produced in the skin by UV light over the conversion of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ids to vitamin D@@ 3 .
the main effect of D@@ 3 is the increase in intestinal res@@ or@@ ption of calcium and phosph@@ ate and the regulation of serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a lack of secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ ac@@ ia can lead to an increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III trials , the central asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % in the fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo 6.3 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients suffering from one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the Ascen@@ sions of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ phy continued to remain ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Incre@@ ased to an intraven@@ ous reference dose , the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women was 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging between 5 and 70 m@@ g. after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before taking a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability rose to approximately 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first food or drink of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) did not lead to a clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in average in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies in rats have shown that al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue following an intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but is then quickly divided into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After IV administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , approximately 50 % of the radio@@ actively marked substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .
following an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was 71 ml / min and the systemic Clear@@ ance did not exceed 200 ml / min .
in rats , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the acid or alkal@@ ine transport system of the kidneys , and is therefore not thought to affect the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines by these transport systems .

characteristics in patients with pre@@ clinical studies have shown that the portion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as well as in animal tests can also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
in patients with reduced kidney function , a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of alpha dr@@ on@@ ate can be expected in the bones ( see Section 4.2 ) .

adv@@ agra@@ ph is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent rejection of transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the Company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a year of treatment ( for example , by examining how often a new organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter further studies were carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and investigated how adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with possible hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , adv@@ agra@@ ph may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be cau@@ tious when others ( especially some herbal ) may be taken at the same time with adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the Adv@@ ance dose or the dose of the drug may need to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; re@@ aliz@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under tight control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a consequence of switching to alternative form@@ ulations , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate can adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below )
following the conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus fe@@ at levels should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after adjustment .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a tal@@ low level , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
thorough and repeated inspections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ level are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ t under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ t phase .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clearing substance , an adaptation of the advance dose can take several days until the steady state is reached .
if the condition of the patient does not allow oral intake of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of the application To supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be given .
dosage recommendations - K@@ id@@ ney transplan@@ t Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may be necessary later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation Pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ ance therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
Dos@@ is@@ recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f Do not require a transplan@@ t receptor from twice daily dose of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , this conversion has to be done in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the whole daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ ts must begin with the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are switched to adv@@ agra@@ ph , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken daily once in the morning .
other transplan@@ ts , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ ph in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal patients , underwent vit@@ rec@@ tomy in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in specific patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood flow in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
patients with reduced kidney function since kidney function does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine intake , a calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ in and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
conversion from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ to to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases using full @-@ blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level checks .
it is recommended to conduct frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level in the first two weeks after transplan@@ t , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ide levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ ph , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ whole blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ agra@@ ph is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the steady state has entered .
clinical studies indicate that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of the level in the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the secre@@ tion of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in thorou@@ gh@@ bred in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually lie in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and in case of kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range from 5 to 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur as a result of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over @-@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and appropriate daily dosage ; re@@ aliz@@ ations of the formulation or regime should only be performed under tight control of a physician experienced in transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which has proven to be therapy resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data is yet available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ agra@@ f .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation adv@@ agra@@ f are still available for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of transplan@@ t gra@@ fts in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients .
because of possible interactions leading to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during treatment with adv@@ agra@@ ph can be avoided ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , as the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , a anterior or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy referred to as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients taking Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus symptoms of PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
as Adv@@ ant@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption need special care .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and therefore increase or decrease the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood level with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the metabolism of the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain constant concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ con@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the action of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed with medication , which is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism affects .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the exposure to hormones , decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures should be particularly cau@@ tious .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the number of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients show no indication that in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and the outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially concerning its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ alkal@@ emia of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side @-@ efficacy profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not exactly detected because of the patient &apos;s underlying disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
subsequent effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases , as is known , in other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , which often increases suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infection ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ a ) .
cases of N@@ eph@@ ro@@ phy and J@@ C @-@ Virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy , including adv@@ agra@@ ph therapy .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors are reported in conjunction with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
because of its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high retention of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ si@@ zable .
mechanism of action and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular nucle@@ us .
this leads to cal@@ ci@@ um@@ ber dependent escap@@ ement of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thus preventing tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

175 patient transplantation patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases were treated as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted multi @-@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
in the first year after the transplan@@ t , a chronic gra@@ ft rejection , the ob@@ liter@@ ation of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis , was observed less frequently ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ ar and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it occurred in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to develop a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % in C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was greater after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ated syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi@@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , receiving a random@@ ised procedure called tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached for the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ tations showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of the metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs via the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than in Pro@@ gra@@ f in case of stable patients who were switched from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( once a day ) to Adv@@ ance 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or inner organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method known as re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , capable of forming the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures was investigated .
in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic episodes with &quot; excellent &quot; and &quot; good &quot; was evaluated .
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein , or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a permit for placing adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , factor VI@@ II should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , an appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma gas is recommended to control the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , various in vivo recovery and different half @-@ value times .
3 Pre@@ vention for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II @-@ plasma activities are not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled at an appropriate dose , a test must be performed in order to prove an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be considered .
the administration speed should be directed according to the patient &apos;s condition , with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ phy@@ at@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II @-@ oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 days of exposure is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors , a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product was observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II to another , the recur@@ rence of ( low @-@ ti@@ ghter ) inhibit@@ ors .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences about the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s , which occur in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , which showed a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ ke occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole time and both the Factor VI@@ II@@ - M@@ irr@@ ors in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 145 children and adults 2 with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 days of exposure .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
previously untreated patients from a running clinical study formed 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins has been analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ war@@ dness as well as a persistent peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
four patients were reported to report on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pres@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ ous gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co@@ factor for the activated Factor IX and speeds up the formation of activated factor X out of factor X .
all Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( bas@@ eline value of factor VI@@ II @-@ activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters come from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 100 previously treated patients or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to assess the benefits of risk weighing as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , has decided that the authorisation holder should apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) officially announced that the Company res@@ umes its application for approval for the application of Adv@@ ance to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer .
usually , however , the breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissue that links and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to be able to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified in such a way that there are no copies of itself and thus no infections in humans can trigger .
adv@@ in could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors so that cancer cells should be able to form the normal p@@ 53 protein once again .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the p@@ 53 gene contained in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be restored .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer occurred in the area of the sub@@ structure , the bones and the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had examined the answers of the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ answered .
based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP produces a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ance in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients .
the committee further concerns the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company has not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ in can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company does not inform CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal will have consequences for patients who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ance .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are assembled in such a way that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other gradually over a few hours .
aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nose @-@ path@@ ways caused by an allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents ages 12 and older , the recommended dose of a@@ ero is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially swelling of the mu@@ cous membrane ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cleared .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients wore their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
when examining the symptoms of hay fever other than the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , patients who received a@@ a@@ ze reported a 4@@ 6.@@ 0 % decrease in symptoms compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was observed , the patients showed an allevi@@ ation of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who took des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of a@@ a@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( other medicines for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( stroke caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the placing of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze on the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without breaking up , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms fade away .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , since the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine may decrease with time during long @-@ term use .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
as aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or , or within 2 weeks of termination of such therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , ly@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ ar@@ olin , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data did not suff@@ ice to make appropriate recommendations for dosage .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze have not been checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that treatment in case of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the head@@ aches ) must be removed .
patients with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze must be replaced at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions and reduce them to their degree .
in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and placebo @-@ treated patients , regardless of whether it was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the safety of the application of aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies resulted in no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive @-@ studies of animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impairment of the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , prec@@ ep@@ di@@ ale pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly prob@@ able in children , just like at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose study with adults , this loss of 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement parameters of the fluid , including the reinforcement of subjective sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo for the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients were enrolled between the ages of 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the mu@@ cous membrane swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
in the context of a single dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of the dosage in the plasma .
after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ of@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the f@@ low@@ con@@ formation of lost chlor@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were badly metabol@@ ised .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to exposure to the gift of an aer@@ ob@@ atic tablet .
based on conventional studies on the toxic@@ ity and toxic@@ ity of repeated application , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , however , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally associated with the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1 . 8.1 of the marketing application described pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .

it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg fusion tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children between the ages of six and eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
efficacy was measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ r@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance during the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to demonstrate that the body utili@@ zes sy@@ rup , the solution for taking and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is un@@ think@@ able .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of symptom scores ( symptom points ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients who received a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , symptoms of symptoms after six weeks with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company SP Europe for placing A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous course of illness and can be terminated after the symptoms have ended and resum@@ ed .
in case of persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a prolonged treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol , the dimin@@ ishing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in rare cases it may come to light that can cause damage to the transport capability or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo .
the most frequently reported adverse events reported in the placebo group were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 adol@@ escent patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ aches , which occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose trial administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) .
this includes in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mac@@ ular cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( twice the clinical dose ) over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , D@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ n 5 mg did not show any influence on standard measurement parameters of the gli@@ ding , including the reinforcement of subjective sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms in 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the total core of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in different forms and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited more easily pro@@ spec@@ tively .
since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ ti@@ ari@@ al diseases , it is expected that in addition to the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in the rate of it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients were compared with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of the patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be completely ruled out .
in vivo des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ rel radi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on the toxic@@ ology , toxic@@ ity of repeated injection , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken separately from meals to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
apart from the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance levels ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is metabol@@ ised fully , is identical to that of children who metabol@@ ise normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the dimin@@ ishing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose was 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi@@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dosing ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily loss of 1,@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which a dose of up to 20 mg was applied daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the case of diar@@ rho@@ ea in a dose of 45 mg daily ( twice the clinical dose ) applied for 10 days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was noted .
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents led to no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor activity in clinical trials .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither an increase in alcohol @-@ induced performance impairment , nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total core of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this constra@@ ined phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup form@@ ulations for children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s which are severely metabol@@ ised .
the load ( AU@@ C ) caused by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant active substance cum@@ ulation after daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies , AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received a dose of 5 mg in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ in@@ bottles with a child@@ proof polypropylene closure cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at once a day put in your mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before applying , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate can be taken for insertion without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose trial , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were used .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated . this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study where in a dose of 45 m@@ g. a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for 10 days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo for the recommended dose of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single dose study with adults , this loss of 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement parameters of the fluid , including the reinforcement of subjective sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the total core of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg fusion tablets added once a day to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before applying , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg fusion tablets during the treatment of children under 6 years have not yet been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the loss and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us &apos;s melting tray proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for the loss of lost cas@@ ein .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant or clin@@ ically statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant doses of up to 20 mg were used during a clinical study with multiple doses of up to 20 mg daily .
in a single dose study with adults , this loss of 5 mg has no effect on standard measurement parameters of the fluid , including the reinforcement of subjective sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness or the tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly metabol@@ ising phen@@ otype was comparable for adul@@ thood ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , the safety profile of these patients however was not different from that of the general population .
in single dose crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at for intake , the wor@@ dings were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in connection with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets provide the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the overall frequency of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in infants from 6 to 23 months the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rho@@ ea ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , there were no side effects in patients between 6 and 11 years with a one @-@ off dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution .
at recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo was noted .
in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively depend on duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and

A@@ eri@@ us Solution is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , older people included .
if the solution for inser@@ ting an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for insertion with sc@@ aling is included , you can use it alternatively to take the appropriate amount of solution for insertion .
regarding the duration of your treatment , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you are suffering from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution to intake .
however , diar@@ rho@@ ea , fever and in@@ som@@ nia were frequent side effects in children under 2 years of age , while in adults ti@@ redness , dry mouth and head@@ aches were reported more often than with placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for intake is available in bottles with a child@@ proof locking cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml pack@@ et size is a measuring spoon or an application sy@@ ringe f@@ û@@ r preparations for insertion with sc@@ aling of 2.5 ml and 5 ml cans .
Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the CH@@ MP Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) to withdraw its application for approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov on the prevention of the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus spreads , which can easily be spread from person to person because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies earlier in a contact with a flu virus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; subsequently , the membrane cover of the virus with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognis@@ es as body @-@ alien ) was clean@@ sed , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data base was therefore not sufficient to assess the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are taking part in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , a@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has examined the anti@@ viral drug of the patient previously taken , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between the ages of 4 and 12 , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of a@@ gener@@ ase after body weight is recommended .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood when taking in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage to the immune system and thus the development of infected infections and diseases .
A@@ gener@@ ase was tested in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the medicine A@@ gener@@ ase , enhanced with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with not det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( virus load ) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks of a@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors responded very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who earlier had been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , this medicine , with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , lowered the viral load after 16 weeks as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger reduction of the viral load after four weeks than with the patients who continued to take their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of a@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , nausea , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines , which are broken down just like ag@@ ger@@ ase and are in high concentrations in the blood to be harmful to health .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take A@@ gener@@ ase have the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ sis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of a@@ general use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs were out@@ weighed for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee stated that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited an approval for the placing on the market in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be given to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic booster of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of a@@ general in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 , due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
the simultaneous application should be treated with care in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ cles 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and reduced therapeutic effects of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with a@@ general , does not prevent the risk of HIV transmission to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver b@@ umps with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information on this medicine .
patients with pre@@ existing liver function including chronic active hepatitis show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid@@ al effects including C@@ ush@@ ing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ ase with lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
because of the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is simultaneously given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ pi@@ ate , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the possible risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ co@@ content of the A@@ Gener@@ ase solution , this dosage form is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
a@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other illnesses whose therapy needed medicines to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis are present .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ale opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initiation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , leading to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with a low therapeutic width are not allowed at the same time with medicines that have low therapeutic width and are also sub@@ strates of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 I@@ so@@ oo 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given along with medicines whose active ingredients are mostly mixed with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects for the elevated plasma levels .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the lower plasma levels through a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , un@@ desirable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already receives Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the pren@@ a@@ virus level and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
a dose adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is given with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ rig@@ z below ) .
50 % increased , for C@@ max , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg were used twice a day to prove the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % reduced if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the f@@ antasi@@ es of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary .
treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
be careful not to use this medicine at the same time , as Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine might be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma gas .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , resulting in an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with a@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a@@ general in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of 700 mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value that was observed once daily without simultaneous application of F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines mentioned below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with a@@ general , may cause interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions related to these medicines if they are used in combination with a@@ gener@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it may result in res@@ or@@ ption disrup@@ tions .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
the simultaneous intake of a@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
consequently , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefit of a treatment out@@ weighs the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be expected to increase the plasma levels while administration of A@@ gener@@ ase .
as plasma levels of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including rh@@ eg@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used along with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while caution is required while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ pi@@ ate , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given how to adapt the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus dose if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
combined with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants combined with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( e.g. Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is overweight in human breast milk .
during the lac@@ tation period , a reduction in the 12 body weight during pregnancy showed a reduction in the reproduction of pregnant rats , which was administered by the im@@ pregn@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive capacity was not impaired by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
most of the side effects associated with the a@@ general treatment were mild to moderate , rising early and rarely resulted in a break @-@ up .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ F@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily .
events ( grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as changes in the laboratory ( grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and facial fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ dic fat accumulation .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ular @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and spontaneously occ@@ ured during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r had to be stopped .
cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections can be developed at the time of initiation of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of a@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those received under general a@@ gener@@ ase treatment ; one exception was elev@@ ations of tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often occurred .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and thereby prevents the process of viral G@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g pol@@ arity poly@@ pos@@ ein@@ ets with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non infectious viral particles .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro vs. HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the link between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and inhibit@@ ing HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely have been observed .
at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a four @-@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as well as a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically validated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain cross resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ pre @-@ treated patients , in which a fung@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus hal@@ ign pattern failed ( one of them proved a resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 isol@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ fla@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early termination of a failure therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre @-@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub@@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 had been treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg two times daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg two times a day , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients pre @-@ treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , about 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 B@@ ased on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ general should be taken into consideration in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50 % increased , for C@@ max , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , respectively represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram base .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those performed on healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals during dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ times ( rat ) of the exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there was little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data to humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kern@@ test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes included , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of a@@ general nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated with 4 days of age showed high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ jug@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( booster ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the simultaneous application should be treated with caution in patients with mild or mild liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
a@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ related factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50 % increased , for C@@ max , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as accurate pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ a@@ vir@@ ine is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with a@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will fall to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these medicines .
in a clinical study , in which rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g of flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
combined with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants combined with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease of the AU@@ C and C@@ min from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful weighing of the possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the im@@ pregn@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in the case of over@@ dosing , the patient is to observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , necessary suppor@@ tive measures can be initiated .
the anti@@ viral activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro vs. HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied in both acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r lies in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the other hand , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; maintaining this activity appears to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; untreated &quot; a@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval , depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , respectively represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in male animals in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8 @-@ times ( rat ) of the exposure in humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated with 4 days of age showed high mortality in both the controls and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabol@@ isation channels are not fully mat@@ ured in young ones , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ Gener@@ ase solution for inclusion is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ Gener@@ ase solution was neither demonstrated in the patients treated with PI nor with PI previously treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % lower than from am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation can be recommended for the simultaneous application of A@@ Gener@@ ase solution to intake and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of A@@ Gener@@ ase solution for insertion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a consequence of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution for taking small children and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may result in a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with a@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines which may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
a@@ gener@@ ase should be suspended in the long term if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ o@@ thro@@ sis are present .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development .
50 % increased , for C@@ max , by contrast , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the simultaneous intake of a@@ gener@@ ase can considerably increase their plasma concentrations and cause P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors to cause associated side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see paragraph 4.4 ) .
on the basis of the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am &apos;s or@@ ally injection is expected to significantly increase the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is unknown . A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r related substances were detected in the milk lac@@ tation rats , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is overweight in human breast milk .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was administered by the im@@ pregn@@ ation in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are related to the use of A@@ gener@@ ase or any other medicines used at the same time , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral non pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved F@@ os@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described rarely have been observed .
the early departure of a failure of 60 treatments is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 B@@ ased on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ble@@ ached &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ general should be taken into consideration in therapy optimisation with PI pre @-@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream can be applied five times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is applied three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
the cream is thin @-@ layer to the affected area of the skin before bed@@ time , so that it stays on the skin for a long time ( about eight hours ) before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator for efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete redemption rate was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a , but only 3 % to 80 % in the patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p with immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limiting the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
treatment with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream continues until all visible war@@ ts disappeared in the genital or peri@@ stal@@ tic area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment course described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions were healed only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is left out , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is applied in a thin layer and rub in the puri@@ fied , infected skin area , until the cream is fully absorbed .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible ag@@ gra@@ vation of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take place in these patients between the benefits of treatment with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily pre@@ h@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case with circumcision are observed .
an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irritation was observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occ@@ ured at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experiences are currently available for the application of i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ aneous appropri@@ ations for the treatment of external influ@@ enza in the genital and peri@@ an@@ tic area .
although limited data point to an increased rate of in@@ clin@@ ometer for HIV positive patients , i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of cow@@ ards .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined .
local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions usually decreases during therapy or the reactions proceed after the treatment with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream .
if it is necessary due to patient complaints or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in the case of super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experience is present in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application of pre @-@ treated tumours is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study point out that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not studied for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osen on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ stick .
only very limited data are available about the use of i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osen in anatom@@ ical areas outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands do not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity over the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream .
if local skin reactions cause serious discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for several days .
data from an open clinical trial reveals that patients with more than 8 les@@ ions reported lower overall treatment rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , we@@ aving or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) are achieved either after one @-@ time or after repeated topical application , no recommendation can be given for the application during the lac@@ tation period .
the most common adverse events reported and possibly associated with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream were local reactions in the treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
the most frequently reported and prob@@ able or possibly associated side effects with the application of i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ treated bas@@ al patients from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical study reported adverse events .
the most common adverse events , probably or possibly associated with the application of i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , were in these studies a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine ) .
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three @-@ week treatment with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream it often came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ thema ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ tion / sli@@ pping / sli@@ pping ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) .
the evaluation of the clinical signs indicated according to the test plan shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream it was very common to severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and too severe formation and cal@@ ori@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials investigating the use of i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was found with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently unique oral intake of 200 mg of i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the contents of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
clin@@ ically severe side effects that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg were hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after or@@ ally or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , increasing systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that efficacy in relation to complete healing of cow@@ ards in i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment is clearly superior over 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
60 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine completely healed the patients ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of male patients treated with i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , compared to 5 % of 161 men treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five @-@ time use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this also remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic , hyper@@ trop@@ hic les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ ren@@ ces rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications External war@@ ts , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and therefore have not been studied .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of i@@ i@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine could not be shown in these studies in the doses studied ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or more ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three @-@ week application for 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of drugs in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml when applied in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ infected skin of patients between 6 and 12 years was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ fici@@ ally bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study on the der@@ mal toxic@@ ity of the rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study conducted for the der@@ mal application for four months yiel@@ ded no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice with der@@ mal administration on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application area .
the mechanism is not known , but because i@@ ri@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only has low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , a risk for the human being is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure .
the tum@@ ors appeared in the group of mice treated with the non @-@ active cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it may harm other people even if these have the same symptoms as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have significantly impaired or you notice side effects that are not stated in this utility information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
● F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of gen@@ itals ( sexual organs ) and anus ( after ) . this is a common , slow growing form of skin cancer with very low lik@@ el@@ ihood of spread to other parts of the body .
if it remains untreated , it can lead to distor@@ tions , especially in the face - therefore early detection and treatment is important .
ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are harsh areas of the skin that occur in people who have been exposed to much of the solar radiation during their previous life .
Al@@ dar@@ a should only be used in flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system , where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most appropriate treatment for you .
Al@@ dar@@ a Creme supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for the infection .
if you have already used Al@@ dar@@ a cream or other similar preparations , please inform your doctor about this before starting treatment . o Use Al@@ dar@@ a cream only when the area to be treated is cured after a previous medication or surgical treatment . o A@@ void contact with eyes , lips and nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a .
for accidental contact , remove the cream by r@@ ins@@ ing with water . do not rinse the cream in@@ war@@ dly . o Use no more cream than your doctor ordered you . o If reactions occur at the treated area that cause you strong discomfort , wash the cream with a mild soap and water .
as soon as the reactions are cleared , you can continue the treatment . o inform your doctor if you have no normal blood count
if this daily cleansing is not performed under the fores@@ kin , swelling , th@@ inning of the skin or difficulties when re@@ trac@@ ting the fores@@ kin can be expected .
do not apply Al@@ dar@@ a cream in the ureth@@ ra , vagina ( vagina ) , cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( anus ) .
if other medications have serious problems with your immune system , you should use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle .
if you have sexual intercourse during the infection with cow@@ ards in the genital area , the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream after sexual intercourse ( not before ) is to be performed .
please tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have applied recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
do not qu@@ en@@ ch your baby during treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream since it is not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine out@@ performs in breast milk .
the frequency and duration of the treatment are different in case of in@@ clin@@ ations , bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma and ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose ( see specific instructions for each application area ) .
apply a thin layer of Al@@ dar@@ a cream to the clean , dry skin with the war@@ ts and rub the cream gently on the skin until the cream is fully absorbed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; men with cow@@ ards under the fores@@ kin must withdraw the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area underneath ( see section 2 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you need to consider before using Al@@ dar@@ a cream ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dar@@ a is too strong or too weak .
apply a sufficient amount of Al@@ dar@@ a cream each week for 6 weeks in order to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area .

inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist as soon as you feel uncomfortable during the use of Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
if your skin responds too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not continue to use the cream , wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to quickly create a blue stain or cause fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this utility information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions , which res@@ ound over a period of about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed .
occasionally , some patients notice changes at the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , formation of skin , inc@@ is@@ mati@@ tis , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue .
occasionally , some patients suffer from changes at the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , swelling and sc@@ ars , ul@@ cer@@ ation , facial swelling , swelling of the eye li@@ ds , throat pain , facial swelling , ul@@ cers , abdominal pain , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme treatment in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not min@@ ed and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I may occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that complic@@ ate movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but it has also measured its effectiveness ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under five years old Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me reduced G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ thro@@ sis ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , feeling of heat , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a meas@@ ur@@ ability of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be known each year and , if necessary , update this summary whenever necessary .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used to monitor patients receiving Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the placing on the market of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ ali@@ an cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme treatment in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should be performed by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect that occurs during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me should only be done in an appropriate clinical setting where re@@ vit@@ alization devices are available for emergency medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 trial , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies to the larv@@ ae , usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
because there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a prolonged period of interruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction has to be cau@@ tious after an interruption of treatment .
60 minutes before the onset of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ gi@@ me@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over breast milk , is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms during treatment .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older during a treatment duration of up to 4 years are often reported in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions were observed , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial oil ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable drug effects related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study involving 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe displacement form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ ist version occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of 5 were treated with a more severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) .
up to the end of the phase 3 trial ( or until a premature retirement from the study ) , no antibodies were found in 13 / 45 patients , including 3 patients with whom it had never had a ser@@ o@@ ist version .
patients with a lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of the G@@ AG mirror in urine , while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable decrease of G@@ AG in urine was detected .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which appeared not to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of unwanted drug reactions , although the occurrence of un@@ desirable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the treatment of enzymes is the accumulation of enzyme activity , which is sufficient for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation .
following IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the cycle and absorbed by cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely using man@@ nose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms were examined in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected F@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were then recru@@ ited for an open label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to be cured in the following table .
the open renewal study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as outlined in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute lung volume further increased propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
of 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ Atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was found , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point which combines clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal Fe@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minute walk , range of motion of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , a change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) was observed .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their inclusion in the study ( 16 patients with the severe form of displacement and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were observed after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the moderate circulation form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe form of delay only limited or no progress in cognitive development was observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were performed on the G@@ AG mirrors in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may be a justi@@ fiable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information that is available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of patients under the age of 5 was similar to that of elderly and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated application and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to the human being .

this register will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase is present , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during the in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4 , &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
if you use Al@@ dur@@ ac@@ y@@ ms with other medicines please inform your doctor if you take medicines containing Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
advice for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted before use and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors or healthcare professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient tolerate this , gradually increase every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory failure and facial oil .
very common ( occurrence with more than 1 of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin rash • Joint diseases , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • Incre@@ ased fever • F@@ illing of oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion place

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy in patients who have not previously been treated , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an additional &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; ( remedy against vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood count changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , reduced or the dose is reduced .
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
the conversion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer service life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ b were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) .
in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine for cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who had not previously received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived on average 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the mean survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cells were treated for longer survival in the administration of A@@ lim@@ b than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the placing on the market of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union .
every perme@@ able bottle has to be dissolved with 4.@@ 2@@ ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow tank and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for over@@ riding plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - kal advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predominantly plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is given intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ administration and on the day after treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood count should be created before each gift , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a plat@@ el@@ et count .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place taking account of the Na@@ dir of the blood count or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the preceding treatment cycles .
after recovery , the patient must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except ne@@ uro @-@ toxic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be terminated if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- , hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or is continued in the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 , or over 65 years of age , there is an increased side effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data about safety and efficacy .
in clinical studies , no dose adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase value of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be supervised with regard to bone mar@@ row and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ yp@@ al count has returned a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te value again reaches a value of ≥ 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ony , plat@@ el@@ et number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , as observed in previous courses of treatment ( see Section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degrees 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 occurred .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed are required to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as phy@@ - la@@ k@@ tic measures to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see Section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 m@@ L / min ) must avoid simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and less than 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) .
many patients with whom these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ usion can be considered before P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in trans@@ it@@ ell@@ ular space .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed trials when this substance was commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic compound .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
given the possibility of ir@@ reversible gra@@ dient of the reproductive capacity through P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the treatment should be advised to obtain advice regarding the sperm conservation .
high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , like i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ex@@ cre@@ tion resulting from an increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is advisable if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and less than 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) .
as there is no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ time such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed needs to be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in case of an application during pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be used during pregnancy except if absolutely necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of irre@@ versi@@ bly damaging the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the lock @-@ up service .
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed enters the breast milk and unwanted effects of the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ized P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 mixed mono@@ therapies ( n = 164 ) of phase 2 , except for neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are probably due to differences in the patient population as the pha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre@@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events that may be possible in connection with the study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSC@@ LC , who received random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and received 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC , which were random@@ ised to C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and Gem@@ cit@@ abine .

severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and trans@@ it@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attack were occasionally reported in hospital studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
from clinical studies , patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fusion , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
from clinical studies , patients with mixed @-@ mixed treatment occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
it has reported cases of acute ren@@ al failure in P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed before , during or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic an@@ alogy , which ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ ate @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the Thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ de m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study by A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin with malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had clin@@ ically significant advantage of survival compared to patients who were only cur@@ led with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients receiving the investig@@ ational treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) associated with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ o@@ theli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared with the sole c@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin @-@ arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms were improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a reduction in lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ized , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC after previous chemotherapy was treated with medi@@ an survival of 8.@@ 3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , in patients with squ@@ am@@ ous cell carcin@@ oma in favour of Do@@ x@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( n = 172 , 6.@@ 2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
patients who take All@@ i and cannot receive weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot metabol@@ ise some fats in their food , causing approximately one quarter of the fats led with food un@@ d@@ owed to the intest@@ ines .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily stain@@ s at anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stool , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ ke , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , departure of o@@ ily secre@@ tions ( rot@@ ting ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft stools .
it should not be applied to patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ ts ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be applied in patients who suffer from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or to ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and for pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited an approval for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the entire European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ thy , fatty diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
however , since or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of dosage is necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Pre@@ mature treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see Section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or high @-@ fat diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these medicines has to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent the potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a decrease of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma gas was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( international normal @-@ ised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentration of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta carot@@ ene in the normal range remained .
however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin absorption ( see section 4.4 ) .
after giving a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , was observed with a slight decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the frequency of known side effects reported on the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of unknown size .
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can cause anxiety in terms of potential or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 m@@ g. three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose reported after the launch , either no side effects or similar side effects were reported as with the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the assimil@@ ating properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect consists in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ ous lip@@ ases .
from clinical studies , 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocked absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced nutrition .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study , who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months .
the mean change in Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the mean change in LD@@ L cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , in therapeutic dos@@ ages , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could only be proved spor@@ adi@@ cally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ to@@ Ring ) and M3 ( M1 after spl@@ itting the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine @-@ group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients , with approximately 42 % of total plasma concentrations .
based on conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated injection , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular risk to humans .

all@@ i is used for weight reduction and is used for overweight adults aged 18 and over with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 28 or above . all@@ i should be used in conjunction with a low @-@ fat and low cal@@ orie diet .
the BM@@ I helps you determine whether you have a normal weight or overweight compared to your height .
even if these conditions do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should still ask your doctor for a control examination .
for each 2 kg body weight you lose during a diet , you can lose an additional kil@@ ogram with the help of all@@ i .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription @-@ only medicine .
C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in is used after organ transplan@@ tations , severe rheumato@@ id arthritis and certain severe skin diseases .
oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives and all@@ i • The effect of oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive remedies for contrac@@ eption ( pill ) may be weakened or repe@@ aled if you have severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) .
before taking all@@ i to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you : • A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one for the treatment of heart rhythm disorders . • Apply ar@@ tery for the treatment of diabetes .
ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take all@@ i and if you take medicines for high blood pressure , as you may need to adjust the dosage .
for further helpful information on the blue sides in Section 6 , you can find out how to set your cal@@ orie and fet@@ al boundary .
if you om@@ it a meal or contain any fat , take no capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal that contains too much fat , you risk food @-@ related side effects ( see section 4 ) .
to get used to the new eating habits , start with a cal@@ ori@@ - and fatty diet already before the first capsule intake .
food di@@ aries are effective as you can understand at all times what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier for you to change your dietary habits .
in order to reach your target weight , you should define two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Fe@@ el fat reduction to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies ( see paragraph 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before starting taking the capsules .
remember to consult your doctor beforehand if you are not used to exercise . • Sta@@ y physically active while taking and after taking all@@ i .
• If you cannot detect any reduction of your weight after twelve weeks of application of all@@ i , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice .
you may have to stop taking all@@ i . • In case of a successful weight loss , it is not important to change your diet for a short time and then return to the old habits .
• If less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the capsule . • If more than an hour has passed since the last meal , take no capsule .
flat@@ ul@@ ence ( with and without o@@ ily res@@ ignation , sudden or increased bow@@ el movement and soft stools ) can be attributed to the mechanism of action ( see section 1 ) .
severe allergic reactions • severe allergic reactions can be seen in the following changes : severe breathing , swe@@ ating , skin erup@@ tions , it@@ ching , swelling in the face , heart rate , circul@@ atory collapse .
29 Very common side effects These can occur with more than 1 out of 10 people taking all@@ i . • flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) with and without o@@ ily leaving • Pl@@ ötz@@ lich Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ ig • Gre@@ at@@ est or o@@ ily chair • White chair inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects increases or you significantly impaired .
common side effects These can occur in 1 out of 10 people taking all@@ i . • stomach ( stomach ) pain , • In@@ kontin@@ enz ( stool ) • wat@@ ery / liquid chair • Incre@@ ased Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ urge • Know@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of these side effects increases or you significantly impaired .
it is not known how often these effects occur . • Incre@@ ase of certain liver enzyme levels • effects on blood cl@@ ot@@ ting in patients who take war@@ far@@ in or other blood @-@ dil@@ uting ( anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ulating ) drugs .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice side effects that are not stated in this utility information .
the most common side effects hang together with the effect of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks of treatment , as you might have not been able to consistently reduce the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional defici@@ encies : • Start some days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced nutrition . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take to yourself .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich central court or a substantial counter@@ f@@ eit as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these trace symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children in@@ accessible after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date indicated on the box . • Ke@@ ep not over 25 ° C . • Ke@@ ep container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low it . • You can carry your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) , which is included in this package .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • diabetes • heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ ak your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
long @-@ term weight loss , such as improving the diet and more exercise , can prevent serious diseases and have a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find as a indication of the food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume each day .
• The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • D@@ ue to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , adher@@ ence to the recommended fat intake is decisive .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this may mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by adher@@ ing to the recommended fat intake , you can maximize the weight loss while at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional defici@@ encies .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose weight about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you can walk daily only little or at all , work stairs , work in the garden or do other physical activities . • &quot; Medium Physi@@ cal Activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , i.e. through 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minute gardening work or 2 km of running in 15 minutes .
• For long @-@ term weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a dietary supplement containing information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you nour@@ ish cal@@ ory and fat reduction and give guidelines to becoming more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type , this information helps you to develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ eme@@ tics ) .
it is not recommended to use patients under 18 years of age because there is not enough information about the effects of this age group .
this means that the active ingredient inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines .
in three main studies Alo@@ xi was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong respectively moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are moderate causes of nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours following chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted authorisation to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
alo@@ xi is indicated for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting associated with chem@@ o@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy because of cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids previously given prior to chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al obstruc@@ tions or signs of sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- interval is extended or that tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy alone , Alo@@ xi is neither used for the prevention nor treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five examined chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical trial there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( D@@ exam@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , Chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ ine , Ch@@ ini@@ dine , Ran@@ iti@@ dine , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience with the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical studies , the most common adverse events with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were reported ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least with alo@@ xi ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of un@@ desirable events as in other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects relationships to be observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for an al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mg / m2 of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients given intraven@@ ously at day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin plus 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and d@@ ag@@ et@@ ron .
according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ colon@@ isation and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was to evaluate the EC@@ G effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration , an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ is@@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
according to the intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase of the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration measured between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that the total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to that measured after one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg ; however , the C@@ max was higher after one @-@ off dosage of 0.@@ 75 mg .
approximately 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and around 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in @-@ vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the is@@ other@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified ingredient made about 40 % of the given dosage .
following a unique intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection for healthy patients , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elim@@ ination time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified .
in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient above the maximum human@@ istic exposure suggest@@ ing low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ colon@@ isation and pro@@ lon@@ gs the duration of action .
large doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is determined in humans for one @-@ time use , the relevance of these results is assessed as low for the human being .
the holder of this approval for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report , in which the approval of the approval for the placing on the market for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ e@@ 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug en@@ vious , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medical drug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic examination , the liver tissue is damaged , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine Amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was inj@@ ected into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ e@@ um presented data demonstrating the comparison of al@@ ph@@ e@@ um with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medical drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medicine after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients responding to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
following the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon , the disease again fl@@ amed more patients than in the reference medical drug . in addition , Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficiently validated .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected physical la@@ the ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not have an effect on these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 , the skin area to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was clin@@ ched after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under placebo were referring to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were examined at home customers , about 90 % of patients in both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was noted that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( egg @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been proven or probably caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the job site .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections were out@@ weighed : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation due to the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment should be stopped , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped out and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections with MR@@ SA as a patho@@ gen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies with secondary infections , the efficacy of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the impact of the simultaneous application of retin@@ in@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations which have been achieved with people after topical application on skin or infected surface wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 Ac@@ cor@@ ding to an oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole the mean retin@@ ob@@ in@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max for topical application increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment on a sk@@ imm@@ ed skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued or continued or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / stopped is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go used , the most commonly reported adverse effect of irritation at the date of performance , which affects approximately 1 % of patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the action mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site is involving ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase Centre .
by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pe@@ p@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent normal formation of active 50 @-@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the use of retin@@ ot@@ ulin at least seem question@@ able at least some forms of infection , a consultation by experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of retin@@ ot@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of a non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains should be considered with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and on se@@ amed skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ in@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
the sampling procedure took place on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic intake of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 sk@@ imm@@ ed skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) was 6@@ 60 times lower than the retin@@ ob@@ in@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , with a protection against hepatitis B possibly only after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation , and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses can be completed .
if a ref@@ res@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , the Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines act by &quot; contributing &quot; to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the vaccine approved since 1996 Twin@@ rix adults and the vacc@@ inated vaccine Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children , who had developed a month after the last injection a protective antibody concentration .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month distance between the two inj@@ ections .
in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix took a month after the last injection to develop anti @-@ antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix protection was similar to a six month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 out of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other ingredients or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals a permit for placing Ambi@@ rix in the overall market .
the vacc@@ ination plan for the pri@@ mer imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix is made up of two doses , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ HBV @-@ B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully ensured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - ination need a booster shot as protection because they may also be protected by immun@@ ological memory in the case of no more det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction following the vaccine administration .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with disorders of the immune system , an adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody level may not be achieved after pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ability , so that in these cases additional vacc@@ ination doses may be required .
since intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal failure rate , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems , the Ambi@@ rix may , however , be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ e@@ ously , as in these cases , bleeding can occur after intra@@ muscular administration .
when Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ite , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ability , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ care and preserv@@ atives @-@ based vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 up to including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity on a basis of the calculation per V@@ acc@@ al@@ lic Aci@@ d , but not on a basis for the calculation per person .
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % of the subjects after the administration of a dose of 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to pro tape ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects given Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % of subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the incidence of severe pain and dex@@ ter@@ ity was low and comparable to the observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses ino@@ cul@@ ation scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ence group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the percentage of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical studies conducted at vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose administered to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans were given Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was un@@ usable , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 were significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that found after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses of a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme to that in the 0 @-@ 12 months vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year at the same time with a booster shot of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ite , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ umps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ect@@ - and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions ratios as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physical visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state charge release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as swimming in water contaminated by eff@@ lu@@ ents .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may possibly require a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against infection with hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or sick at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be con@@ stru@@ ed .
• If you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
allergic reaction can be caused by it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you / your child has already an allergic reaction to a previous vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , it will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective components per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface agent ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected to persons suffering from severe blood co@@ ag@@ ulation disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened by illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense or if you / your child undergo hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child is taking other medicines ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child has been vacc@@ inated or has been given immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) / has been planned or planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normally , pregnant or nursing women will not be given , unless it is urgently needed that they be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix please inform your doctor if you / your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 missed doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dil@@ uted cans ) : • swelling at the injection point • F@@ ever fever ( above 38 ° C ) • ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
other side effects that have been reported for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 associated doses ) are :
these include locally restricted or extended r@@ ashes which can be ju@@ cken or b@@ low@@ ish , swelling of the eyes and face , start@@ ling breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 Get your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on data that has been known for placing the first approval for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix has been brought into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to limited patient exposure .
amp@@ on@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ ohydr@@ ates - divided into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal tube ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , as Am@@ mon@@ ago could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active ingredient ) .
black@@ caps can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste ren@@ dition , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mon@@ ology in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented am@@ moni@@ ac@@ al levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ago was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval , limited information on this medicine was available . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the application is indicated in all patients with a complete lack of enzyme already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use if a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually by taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the growth and development of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ ox@@ yl@@ ase .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8,@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders because there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not get into the stomach immediately .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , respectively 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with care in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ ede@@ ma .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in slow@@ ing the ne@@ ural propag@@ ation and increased neur@@ on loss .
delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth were also found .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during lac@@ tation is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one un@@ desired event occ@@ ured in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were deemed to have been associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
an over@@ dose rate occ@@ ured in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an met@@ abo@@ lically active compound which con@@ jug@@ ated with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore an alternative carrier to ex@@ crete excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate recorded for each gram between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
pro@@ g@@ nosis of early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ ant , and the disease itself led to death itself in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ck@@ less analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
through ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ rate ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born babies at post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who were treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was the survival rate of 100 % , but even in these patients it occurred with time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ hin@@ Tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is dissolved enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after administration of a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis according to the individual and repeated oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous formulation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after taking an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) had no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycli@@ c disturbances or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test results , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no adverse effects with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral dosing of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who have not yet swal@@ lowed tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ intestinal tube or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as for adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ at@@ ox@@ yl@@ ase .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions in the py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al cells of the brain rin@@ ds occurred .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ t@@ aci@@ dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fat
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , phen@@ yl@@ meth@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine can be produced for each gram .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after taking an oral dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ular form 15 minutes after taking measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yl .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nit@@ ro@@ genous waste products that accumulate after eating proteins in the body .
if laboratory tests are carried out with you , you must notify the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently , even if it is not prescription @-@ only medicine .
during breast@@ feeding , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , stopping the ear canal , dis@@ orientation , memory defic@@ its and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or hospital in order to initiate a corresponding treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

they should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS distributed on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ ber@@ th ( hose , which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose , which is guided through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Cut off a straight edge , for example a knife back over the top of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon corresponds to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended amount of measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate from the container .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; raising &quot; ( an abnormal measured value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can continue up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack contribute to the maintenance of blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of An@@ gi@@ ox in any gift or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , the patient was often diagnosed with a st@@ ent ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - was as effective as the conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year altogether .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox regarding all indicators was as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for he@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and for a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox &apos;s placing in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ raising inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended starting dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is used in the patient subsequently , an additional 0.5 mg / kg bol@@ us should be given and the in@@ fusion is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
immediately before the procedure , a diameter of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single bol@@ us administration from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bol@@ ting of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be carried out .
in order to reduce the incidence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully mixed before application and the starting dose can be administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , a further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din versus ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is below 225 seconds , a second one can be administered from 0.3 mg / kg and then check the ACT 5 minutes after the second starting dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of un@@ questioning He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours of termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
the patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of con@@ jun@@ c@@ tival ble@@ ed@@ ings occur in the PCI @-@ patient under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a Per@@ cut@@ aneous Cor@@ on@@ ary Intervention ( PCI ) can generally inc@@ ur bleeding during the treatment .
in patients receiving war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after setting the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the level before treatment .
based on the knowledge about the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate ) it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly checked .
animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , we@@ aving or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ questioning he@@ par@@ in or en@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding , as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the pun@@ cture area requiring radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with known bleeding centre , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed loc@@ alized loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occ@@ ured with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; points of points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or throat .
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI study .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , patients and patients over 65 years of age were more prone to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects which are not listed above have been reported in practice after a comprehensive application and are group@@ ed according to system organ classes in table 6 .
in the case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately dis@@ continued and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific plat@@ former inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic centre as well as in the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , irrespective of whether th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis is bound in the liquid phase or in the cl@@ ots .
the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active Centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din has no th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din has a dose and concentration @-@ depend@@ ant anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is substanti@@ ated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was subsequently carried out in the patient , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ questioning He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were evenly distributed over the three treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and approximately 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a Per@@ cut@@ aneous Cor@@ on@@ ary Intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as a pe@@ p@@ tide implements a cat@@ abol@@ ism in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ valuation of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary met@@ abo@@ lit , which results from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ ine , is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic center of thro@@ mb@@ in .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six and older with diabetes requiring treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar@@ s ) in the blood or that insulin cannot be processed effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in is very slightly different from the human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has shorter duration than a short @-@ acting human@@ insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is used in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin in two studies involving a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot effectively co@@ operated insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lis@@ per .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued an approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for placing A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union .
as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements can be reduced in patients with reduced liver function .
any change of the effective force , the brand ( heart rate ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production may result in a change in the demand for insulin .
3 An insufficient dosage or breakdown of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these states are potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the insulin used and can therefore be changed when changing the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ rami@@ de , phen@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ ine , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , symp@@ a@@ thetic medication such as beta block@@ ers , c@@ lon@@ i@@ din , gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ ine and reser@@ pine can be allevi@@ ated or absent in nor@@ adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation .
animal experiments for reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ oid concerning pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but generally insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral treatment .
listed below are listed according to system organ classes and ordered according to decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , excessive dog , changes in vision , headache , nausea , and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
if li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is missed to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness can be treated by means of an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
after a glu@@ c@@ ant injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially by skel@@ etal muscle and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in response occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose proportional to glucose @-@ saving effects in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , and at 0.3 E / kg or more an under@@ proportional increase of the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like the human insulin .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ insulin .
the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached such as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
according to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with a normal normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
when using insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control will be achieved , such as with a human in@@ acting insulin , which is given 2 mic@@ ell@@ ae prior to the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to normal normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to normal normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to human Nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
