the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by readily available .
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual at &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , choose settings extensions ... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules there .
this is a list of standard settings modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools crashes . then you can view the page that has &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present .
the module An@@ gle filter ( also called the folder filter ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras view filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default the display starts with the root node of the document , for example : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory for local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; is to graphi@@ cally represent ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size .
with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder , and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily identified , even if they are located far down in the folder hierarchy . consequently , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your file system . to facilitate navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful colour and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can represent either depth for easy detection of ne@@ sting depth or representation of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ elled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether it is available at all , only if there is enough space for representation or if the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( and therefore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle ) .
for Tre@@ em@@ aps rendering algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this framework will need space which will not be available to the subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square .
how spl@@ itting the area of an entry is carried out for the subordin@@ ate entries remains up to the implementation . here it is always advantageous for the lab@@ eling and avoiding of space losses through frames so that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods concerning this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View An@@ gle over area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
you can find the picture gallery in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Extras Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the Picture Gallery , a dialog opens , allowing you to specify the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the images per line option has a sli@@ der and a turning field to set the number of thumb@@ nails in each row in the gallery .
check the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image to see if the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
use the check box to view file size of the image to see if the file size is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the check box image size , specify whether the size of the images is displayed in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the dialog box , you specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included .
in the file selection Save in HTML file , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
you can use the check box to include sub@@ folders with a sli@@ der or a turning field to which level the sub@@ folders will be included .
use the check box to copy the original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery .
with the check box comment section , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn colour depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails as in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings gives you easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; working together .
&amp; edited ; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , review and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can easily be extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules .
although &amp; edited ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , as &amp; eg ; via the camera or lens to search for .
like all &amp; k@@ de , programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam , an open source project . that means it is dependent on the support of the end users . therefore , they should report problems and improvement opportunities .
&amp; edited ; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the bug reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the bug reporting system .
&amp; edited ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we want to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; edited ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ plug ; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ plug ; to participate , registration is available in the developer mailing list . instructions to login in the developer mailing list from &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
when you start &amp; Edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data will be saved . this path will remain the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will use additionally as an Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ K@@ am setting up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder . &amp; edited ; viewed every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . while browsing the folders you will get a progress indicator like this :
&amp; edited ; Dur@@ looks recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folders . this allows you to execute exceptionally and digi@@ ti@@ ze ; execute a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can in &amp; digi@@ plug ; set up your digital camera . after that , you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums .
raw File Support : if you are using the raw mode of your camera , you may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported video cameras in the help of raw camera support .
how to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ plug ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; working together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
photo@@ 2 is a free , distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Ima@@ ging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need for additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to reliably read the preview images from digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you may not be able to see thumb@@ nail images or the creation could be very slow .
one of the nic@@ est things to come &amp; see is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules :
K@@ IP plug@@ ins : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ plug ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; edited ; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode using F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ tree , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , data list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . this way , the filter will only work on the file name if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields can be displayed can be configured in the Al@@ ben@@ dings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos created by &amp; edited are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created , the date can be changed in the properties of the album .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select an album Im@@ porting images . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album .
to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the then appearing menu , you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , right click on the album and edit the album features in the contex@@ tual menu .
Alb@@ um@@ - collections : are a method to select your albums to be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection you have placed is used to sort your photos by selecting from the toolbar or sort by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date .
the El@@ dest , A@@ verage , New Year buttons : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest image or that of the album &apos;s average . to do this , first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first open an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as Album icon , click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; Add as Album View . additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; edited ; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the field My keyword list on the bottom left in the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window gives you the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album the first time , you need to wait a little while the thumb@@ nails are generated . you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recre@@ ate all thumb@@ nails .
information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information this is , you can edit about Settings digi@@ kam . set up the albums page and adjust the area preview pictures to your li@@ king .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you let the mouse poin@@ ter rest for a moment above a picture . the help shows the most important properties including all keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the section introduction to the main window shows such help window .
photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that fits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can choose all the features that come with &amp; edited ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or the editing of the images .
you can open image editing using a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the right mouse button of the image . in the digi@@ plug section , you will find a guide how to edit your photos . with the image editing you can view and change your photos .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ plug ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub @-@ menu of opening . for this , and how to customize it to your needs , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after editing by other image editing programs , there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF data and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; edited ; provides two options to rotate . the easiest way is to click the thumb@@ nail to preview and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; Edit , it will be moved into the garbage b@@ ins of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ ste@@ em ; organizes your photos by means of the data . &amp; digi@@ plug ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown .
tags are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned individual photos or whole groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your tags lo@@ gically . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ pi@@ ps ; so that you can find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the tags are re @-@ imported when the database is lost ; the pictures notice .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you add a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will become the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there . then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can be only once in a tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; .
to select another photo as an album icon , select the image with the right mouse button and select as a Album View in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the Album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to take advantage of the functionality with keywords , you must first add your photos . this can be done in two ways : once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; drag and drop it there . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword .
you can have a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be shown once you choose one of the keywords allocated to it . in this way , you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place on which the photo was taken , one for the event with which it was made etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown in the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Rem@@ ove from the menu item menu . the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view displays a time @-@ based adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved using this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection frame that displays the time unit . this displays all the corresponding images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection . it will appear in the list below .
include all database elements : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more .
in addition , the search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search hits . if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red .
the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this you will save a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criteria .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and the search will be done . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after the search again , you only need to select the corresponding entry in my search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information . if you choose to edit as advanced search , the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Search in the context menu .
the Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ plug ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules will be added to this list by operators separately . any option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it . in addition , you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; &amp; quot ; &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they match . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar . by using a threshold , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere above the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sket@@ ch : hand @-@ hand drawing sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ plug ; find the matching pic@@ s . also here you can set a threshold value .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or zoom out or hold it and move it . move it while holding the left mouse button . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . it will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live geo@@ folder .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides a lumin@@ ous table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the lumin@@ aire and its window is opened .
from the preview window , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right part of the window . a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you choose preview from the toolbar and carry out a zoo or move operations on one of the images , you can then compare the same area of the two images .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series . if you use pair @-@ wise navigate from the toolbar , then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison . now use the left mouse button on any preview screen to view it in the right pane . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file editing ....
all picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to wave the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview mode , both images will display the same image area .
zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the zoom knob under the images or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode .
what is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers each part of the process followed after the image was taken up to the final output and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do this , however , not in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we concentrate on the procedures for digital photographers the &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , extrac@@ ting , storing , archiving , optim@@ ising , waiting and export of image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital inventory management refers to , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is , according to your definition , data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment .
if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use it not &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to save the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very quick searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you engage something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc ; note that you will have to change to a larger drive some@@ day .
you might be happy with this structure . vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos then you will use sub@@ folders as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; export . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image .
we also recommend the option to save Met@@ adata in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ plug ; this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album View menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change it ? add &amp; digi@@ plug ; you have a metadata editor available for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign stit@@ ch words , lab@@ eling and evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value .
now let &apos;s use keywords , keywords , as you frequently refer to other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ plug ; automatically insert the tree for you or place the images in the correct place . re@@ ass@@ uring the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ plug ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ tree .
the graphic shows how different metadata is inter@@ sec@@ ted . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data refer to properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to in@@ scrip@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most people don &apos;t want to let anyone see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , family , photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ ou ; in French Nor@@ man@@ die 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream of associations , memories , the historical time span is again present , you may even hear the silence .
for others who view your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer , to help him about the subject you moved has to understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a let@@ tering for itself .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as an inscription . you can even export it for a selection of pictures . if you export your pictures to web galleries , then these labels are exported to your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? good , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips by means of images with geographic information .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove limitations concerning the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the direction page of &amp; digi@@ plug ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should include your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example to protect the identity of the photographer , the name of a company or organization may not be changed . this field does not support comm@@ as nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title : linked to the author . this field contains the photographer &apos;s job description . examples can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note of the author field , this must be filled in as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . if the photographer works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright @-@ sections , even though they do not offer protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify those embedded in the image . for private individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ plug ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you can find problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which cause data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , you have to be cau@@ tious and you can &apos;t trust longer than a couple of years . of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good shooting devices and store them in the correct way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just written them . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect themselves . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard disks , flash drives , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said about CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
write the media with a description , date &amp; author and store it on a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : flo@@ pp@@ ies study
electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error reason , S@@ MA@@ RT is the most common error reason . S@@ MA@@ RT errors are the most common cause of failure . this is especially reading errors and displacement counter@@ s . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems .
while most electric devices do not make much noise , the devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors look different . these can cause serious damage . thus , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed motherboard and other defects . protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector strip . remember , however , that not every connector also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that even all periph@@ er@@ als connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage cont@@ actors that also include a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are especially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and you also have the protection for the modem . this makes it ideal for traveling .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a non @-@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system ordered down . if you purchase a U@@ PS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software are interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in current disrup@@ tions with the cost of avoiding this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to 50 euro ; this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software .
they are in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the compar@@ ably slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online .
the web solutions are very safe from the point of view of the data backup . transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs provide at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you open one day a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year .
Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows is available .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in Alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms using the Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % of the work@@ station systems . in case of lap@@ tops , the percentage of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; has not been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most widespread file systems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that as the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and a high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions , you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so make anyone responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss . therefore , backup your data frequently in accordance with a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the replacement of disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives .
suppose you make your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane accidents : fire , water , electricity , children and the@@ fts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of the physical separation : as said above , a common reason for a data loss despite security is the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made . this backup is the closest one with the exception that is only scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ss@@ h .
backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media .
this procedure gives you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata , stored in the image file IP@@ TC data , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet .
in order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time span you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to consider all that is said today with caution and evaluate anew while time goes by . unfortunately , you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your images , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . for * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it up .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ O ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the number if necessary
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no more software that can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will become easier by year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market , so you shouldn &apos;t use it any more .
P@@ NG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC Met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignments on hetero@@ geneous platforms .
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems . it is developed on the TI@@ FF / EP format and required to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing D@@ NG and we hope the competi@@ tor Canon and Nikon will use it at some point .
this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image Resource block ; .@@ X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ tu ; stored for XML / R@@ DF .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in raw format . X@@ MP fits because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , you should consider whether you are using D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there .
the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections , and enligh@@ tening efforts to achieve far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera directory , you can use this as temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ layer editing , you can use external programs . if you edit the images again &amp; edited , then you should add the metadata again . these were under certain circumstances cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in web galleries , en@@ code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; to get . in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for the file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side@@ bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog shows file characteristics and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the Met@@ adata page toolbar from the main window of &amp; edited ; or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads all photos of your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; . downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only those you want with the default selection methods of &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and select Sel@@ ected . the selected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New is available . these images have not yet been edited by &amp; digi@@ plug ; downloaded . in this case , the new images are selected with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , only the new images are downloaded .
if you use the All or Sel@@ ected buttons , a dialog appears with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored . you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section . select the destination album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once , by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you only want to delete some , you need to select them first and then delete the selected delete .
please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera . you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted into a &amp; digi@@ plug ; you should carefully check if you want to remove them from the camera . if you want to delete the camera cher completely , you should do this via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the file names are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera . this can cause dup@@ licate fil@@ en@@ ames if you upload photos from different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for database @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder is created automatically per day .
the first two relate the data to the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ory Identi@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information to the IP@@ TC Fiel@@ ds . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
for example , if you want a different date format than the standard format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S in the edit field . to do this , turn off the date &amp; time option . for more customiz@@ ations , you should read the support str@@ f@@ time .
if you use the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you will have the option to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters , or in capital letters if you prefer .
the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; edited ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your ren@@ aming settings are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window .
&amp; edited ; can use all information about the camera &apos;s orientation to the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during the download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , you can use it to automatically create sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section , you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually turned off , and in this case saves &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog box appears , where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder cho@@ oser dialog appears for the camera . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position indicated in long@@ itude and l@@ ati@@ tude and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be done by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser showing the area with a click . if you want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . the question is actually more how the data will come into these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , through a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic mapping ( manual ) and last via manual input of known places .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . you need to save this data in g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of pictures and GPS . on the following page you can do the same : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the degrees and l@@ ati@@ tude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Harv@@ ey . it uses the acci@@ dent@@ als of ha@@ v@@ red coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; edited ; tries to give you as much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam . change . to access these settings , you must set up in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ plug ; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardi@@ zation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also during a database synchronization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for the author line : this field should include the photographer &apos;s job title . this can be names such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author field , this must also be filled .
editor is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , if it works for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others &amp; quot ; . if the image is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . it is achieved that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ plug ; . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported ; imported without getting lost .
save image in@@ scrip@@ tions as embedded in@@ scrip@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . thus , your cap@@ tions can also be read by other picture viewers .
the Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse poin@@ ter is in the main window above a file . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ plug ; to view , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . each file in a digi@@ plug ; Album Fol@@ der that has none of these extensions will be ignored by &amp; Edit ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category .
you can set the default values on this page . however , each time you open the light table these settings will be switched on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one then you can get better viewing results .
by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can disable the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the colour information . please read this article in Wikipedia for more information .
with the P@@ NG compression setting you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since P@@ NG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression .
with the TI@@ FF file option , you can comp@@ ress the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality , since the de@@ late algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting of loss@@ less JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss@@ less . even if you select the loss @-@ prone setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . when this paragraph has been written , metadata has not yet been supported , but was in the planning .
in previous versions of &amp; edited , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react to more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels on odd rows , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under exposed images in four steps more details can get in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the standard is the top lights , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned , due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights , as through continuous white . use the setting of continuous white in the settings . last but not least , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as quickly as green and red . &amp; red@@ kam , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a demo vo@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process in order to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
and D@@ rap@@ w provides you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks so . V@@ NG Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( Variable number of gra@@ dients ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ rap@@ w . it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for color gra@@ ding correction , as it is performed during raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to restore it . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information how to translate color information from one color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files start .
color profile folders set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you save all your profiles . &amp; edited ; then examines this folder during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have the option &amp; quot ; default squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to be stored here . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures do not color the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , that do not color tone mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma isn &apos;t correc@@ ting 16 bit depth . this means that you have to do the color mapping itself .
there are more options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated . this could be manually adjusted , rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it &apos;s pretty obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official :
the Canon profile extension lets you realize the style for the target : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ plug can support ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are then downloaded by &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the Pre@@ views .
short commands for tasks performed by Mod@@ ules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper control adjust@@ s the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the images while the ad is displayed .
the camera features show a list of all the currently supported cameras on the left . on the right side there is a button auto detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , switched on and in picture display mode . currently , here are serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage supports .
at the bottom end you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active when you select a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; edited ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera model and port manually . once you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it all here .
with the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images to the tr@@ ash bin , you can display the dialog from &amp; Edit ; when del@@ eting a photo into an album , you will find further details in the del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album .
the editorial changes by the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly applied by &amp; Edit ; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without promp@@ ting . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the button Chan@@ ges .
you can also sign &amp; Edit sp@@ lash screen display ; disable when starting . this will speed up the start process of &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
the Set Bei@@ m start looking for new photos forces forces &amp; digi@@ plug ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ plug ; . if something has been deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ plug ; you , if it should delete it from the database .
different color schemes can be in &amp; edited ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial .
&amp; edited ; provides fast image editing with some basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on thumb@@ nail preview and selecting the item View / Edit .
image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ plug ; so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section Image Processing .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fying factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top edge , including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
you should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with file Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or using the button The button Rest@@ ore image processing in the toolbar . you will then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store .
virtually any image editing action can be und@@ one or restored . the last action can be und@@ one by restoring or restoring the Edit Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to und@@ o and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Con@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press a button for a moment on the return or restore button in the toolbar , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored .
once you have started image editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool bar , picture high , down picture or using the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save it .
you can enter the photo and zoom out into which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select En@@ larger
view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view where you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can see this in the Edit dialog from &amp; Edit ; edit it from the Edit &amp; Edit menu . see the section for setting up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select Print Image from the File menu and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or entire sentences . entire image preview finishes can be printed from your selection . you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Export Collection Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; edited ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrows , even in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
repeated clicking on the same tab allows the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the border again .
in the cap@@ tion view you can type or insert labels with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are permitted . the let@@ tering is copied into the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC Fiel@@ ds so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are de@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should note these restrictions .
after you have commented on it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the descriptions will then be saved .
in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata in the files . however , this is always done when you choose a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu .
the rating is written in the IP@@ TC field Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords applied in this &amp; edited session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword . you can limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the entry field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , these will be saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword filter section .
the keyword filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , date , keyword and search views . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available .
you can also drag and drop key words . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter stands on No keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . you have been selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword from the right keyword has been drawn to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Vari@@ ous .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its , you can easily change it by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
for example , you can set a Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , you need only the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button . the options then look as follows :
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I wrote it mainly on &amp; edited ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why one uses a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scann@@ ers come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scann@@ ers and that the colors that you print or publish in your digital dark@@ room .
when the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflow . in addition , you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow fulfil@@ ls all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management .
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
your only other picture issues are e @-@ mail or web where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should I use a different color space to think about colour management ?
a visual sample of s@@ RGB limitation in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to sound my monitor if I chose to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to use your monitor as s@@ RGB means that your ; on@@ itor carries the circle . if you work as in s@@ RGB colour space , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , compensate , Automatic balance and contrast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction menu to automatically make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est dot is black and the brigh@@ test dot becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
matching : this method adjust@@ s the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright limit tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
enhance contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the largest possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space with 8 bits per color is worked . so if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction are better avoided .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ron@@ ym .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance then click on the sub@@ window .
the target image preview has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above , a hist@@ ogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful since even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called lumin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadow , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or di@@ mming shadow details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the default settings list . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in white balance . this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load buttons make this exactly this . each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it into a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences knob returns all filter values to its default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed .
8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . colour mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter colour management .
another important tool is to find in the menu with color gra@@ ding correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for several photos . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the digi@@ plug ; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar installation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created by using a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and afterwards inver@@ ted the development of the image . the colored , darker areas protected the delicate photographic paper from the additional light .
the intensity controls the solar process . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar installation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ a@@ ot &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts . the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repe@@ ats the thickness of the ne@@ on light . for large images , the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lens thickness / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is positioned to improve exposure . even if the dialog is very complicated to this tool , you only need the area of the sli@@ der for the application here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked inside and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and to observe how the image changes .
on the right you can see the original and the preview of the picture . the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the picture . on the left , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : with this selection box it is possible to specify whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with linear or log@@ arith@@ mic y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear layout is most suitable . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is more useful .
three regul@@ ators : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color pin@@ heads can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the values of shadows , middle and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input will be adjusted automatically for all shadows , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only previ@@ ewed and there is no effect on the final result .
below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left side displays half of the original and the target image . the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images captured using a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sensible . for images with large areas of constant color , linear mode creates a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue .
for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright sounds , you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the related image pixels become darker .
preview the original photos to see a red marker . if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change , a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value . create a dot on this line and move it to and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , means and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ous curve .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if found in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only previ@@ ewed and there is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Edit &amp; digi@@ plug &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; channel mixer ; image editing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color shades of the photos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
with the channel selection box you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and impact . the left part of the window shows you a preview .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the picture will retain the general brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when mixed with mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space . the color space consists of small diamond @-@ art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel looks different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only previ@@ ewed and there is no effect on the final result .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenery images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky .
orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos .
rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure using a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day . thus , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Red filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : generates warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of having a pressure and re@@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ oner . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; apply the texture texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied in the picture below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the modified one ( 2 ) to be seen . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool frames Add can be a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of a be@@ holder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . throughout , the picture moves with a coloured line , ni@@ p@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , rounded off with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a kno@@ ck effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this convenient tool , you can insert easily a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this can also be done in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply insert the text and place it with the mouse . you will need to customize the text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need . finally , simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Tool templates can apply a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template , there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the template , just send an email in english to the &amp; digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you have copied the template files . these settings will be scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the Tem@@ plate folder appears . selecting a folder automatically updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this knob increases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
size : this button decreases the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to reduce the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very quick and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . in fact , it does not shar@@ pen a bit , it works rather psych@@ ologically . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes a really good job . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for custom@@ ization .
images without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digi@@ tization process colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges becoming a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpen@@ ing . images in raw format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a sharpen@@ er already while reading the image . if you disable it , you will get control over your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing value . you can call it with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting sharp@@ ness .
you should handle this carefully , as the results do not work very naturally : the sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most suitable technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can find more information on the menu entry . below re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting soft m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo .
the filter non @-@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . you can see a demonstration here .
the original image and preview will help you to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tested first . if you make the blur@@ ring mask too strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ ates near sharp edges will produce .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image added to the original . this makes the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focused re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Det@@ ection @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ focused quot ; in which it revers@@ es de@@ focusing . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Vienna filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is usually better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by calling colors re@@ focused in image editing .
in practice , the circular folding works much better than the G@@ auss &apos;@@ sche fold . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the source pix@@ el@@ ae , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is strongly influenced by the distant pixels .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should have 1 good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further deterior@@ ate the image .
G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos; sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is non@@ zero . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you might have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
die size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the die size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the G@@ aus@@ sian sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should select a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , which later leave uncomfortable arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg . as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp masks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ ring mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mask must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimum conditions it can never be possible to remove the effect of the blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp picture has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the follow @-@ up methods in digital images , you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address .
the sli@@ der sets the blur@@ ring of the dark@@ ened area to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the color tin@@ ted ink allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en , France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available default settings are listed below :
if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab smoo@@ thing and advanced settings .
detail maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smoo@@ thing over the image . whereas larger values tend to smooth homogeneous regions and allow details to be sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing should be subsequently subordin@@ ated to the direction depen@@ dency .
directional dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smoo@@ thes out uni@@ form@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is only smoo@@ thed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ulation or CCD noise will produce a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Artef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smoo@@ thing factor above all@@ . p then defines the relative smoo@@ thing . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is going through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is selected small , there should also be a small selection . make sure that small angles produce a long run@@ time . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0.1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value less than 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smoo@@ thing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to let him out .
the Save as and Load buttons make this exactly this . correc@@ ting any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is relatively quick at work . however , it may take a long time to load a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Canc@@ el button .
below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see there is a strange black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the journey . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; edited ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on the sensor noise of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed by this tool .
below you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings dialog can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoo@@ thed and therefore smaller errors are corrected .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel pitch to the front to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edges : controls the edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG @-@ arti@@ facts without lo@@ osing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve an image . these settings do not affect the smoo@@ thing process that is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically more blur@@ red , but also eliminates the shadow areas .
d@@ amping : controls the adjustment of the phase j@@ itter d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smoo@@ ther , if it is too high , noise and phase j@@ itter appear at the edges .
save under and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and corrected with ( 2 ) . the noise reduction was applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpen@@ ing a picture . use the tool to sof@@ ten the soft sign with the menu entry Con@@ duc@@ ting soft m@@ oll@@ us@@ cs and experiment with the smoo@@ thing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo arti@@ facts .
this restoration method gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove G@@ auss &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ulation , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local mistakes that occur in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images .
the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Artef@@ akte reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a loss @-@ prone compression algorithm , it generates some compres@@ sions &amp; quot ; art@@ ef@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Load buttons make this exactly this . any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively quick at work . however , it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on one Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 Film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film gran@@ ulation on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures have been applied to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image can be seen below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
die &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixels makes it possible to remove pictures using a CCD camera gem . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pixel quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Def@@ ects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the matching dark@@ image to the picture to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels .
the image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
select an area to preview the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ cut : an average of the neighboring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the faulty pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cub@@ ical curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) , which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ plug ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the ir@@ is filter , which increases the required shutter speed under certain circumstances , which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an aperture of f / 16 or smaller , as otherwise blur@@ ring effects are caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s felt and color depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a c@@ centric filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter . the vig@@ net@@ ting correction tool turns the transformation into a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which creates an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 .
brightness , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide positive values , since you only have to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ just@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing from the color gra@@ dation menu .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
die &amp; digi@@ kam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree covers the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x shape of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s on the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical distortion can be almost eliminated .
general : this value controls the distortion of the distortion part of the second degree . with negative values , distortion @-@ shaped distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of distortion 4 . this value appears more strongly at the margins than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter General .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and results in a correction first . negative values increase while positive image decreases .
brigh@@ tening : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog contains a preview of the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start .
the ton@@ - or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes . ideally , perform this correction first . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton@@ ed correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal support line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ - / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove it with the cutting tool in the menu Transform@@ ers C@@ utting out of image processing or using the zoom regulator of this dialog .
the next logical step for some subjects such as photographs from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand , you will always have an easy distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the barrel @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ ra movie , see this URL . this movie has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the section for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture .
under the preview you can set two parameters to simulate movie gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable Inclu@@ de movie gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gran@@ ul@@ arity and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in conversion . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes ink duc@@ ts for re@@ producing infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter film gran@@ ulation is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool for re@@ producing film gran@@ ulation on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix great silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion .
the cinem@@ atic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular view especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although higher values are often required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gran@@ ulation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; edited ; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature images and still life are good for this effect .
the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smoo@@ thing controls the smoo@@ thing or , viewed from the other side , the sharp@@ ness .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smoo@@ thing 17 .
the digi@@ plug ; filter char@@ coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a coal sket@@ ch . the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized . images of whose gra@@ dients slowly change are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine the scene you chose to outline you . these would be good pictures to start with it .
there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smoo@@ thing ) .
this is an example of the char@@ coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ plug ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ plug ; Filter Gra@@ in is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important one on the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , Mongo@@ lian landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engra@@ ver filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to res@@ ign in the background .
blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking : blur@@ ring the image by random@@ ly shifting the pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitr@@ arily moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color p@@ add@@ les in the picture and blur@@ bs it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photograph into rectangular cells and then recre@@ ates it by filling with an average pixel value .
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Stop .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops to your image . this gives it a wet appearance to your pictures . it uses a computer protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the dro@@ pl@@ ets . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images . number alters the number and density of drops . fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the image .
you can keep an area free from rain@@ drops using the Edit &amp; Edit menu . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter of rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drop filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . you can find the tools in the menu Transform@@ ers Rot@@ ate or Transform@@ ers Spy .
photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached ? how can you recover the missing information or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm which is used here makes here a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change Transform@@ ers size in the menu and specify the target values .
change the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation for enlar@@ ging an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm Photo blown was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool you want to change the size . these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is checked , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set the more will be smoo@@ thed . this is necessary when a lot of noise is present , as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to produce a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose . each st@@ all@@ ying for photo can be saved as a text file and can be loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time to load a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication for comparison .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . to cut a photo you just have to create the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while moving the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be trimm@@ ed by dra@@ gging on the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The trimm@@ ing button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut to size ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly edited photo .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse .
when trimm@@ ing the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
trimm@@ ing the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
below in the dialog , you can use the Max . relation knob to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
the tool Ac@@ cor@@ ding to the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the settings of the inter@@ connect help make it possible to hide help in order to better assemble your pictures . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ level rule , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal .
golden Middle : the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we perceive as beautiful .
the golden pitch is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed their temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; from where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers .
the golden center provides smoo@@ ther hel@@ pers when you put together a picture . these help are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . in comparison to the third @-@ rule , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flux in this way .
a further rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . this rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als to these lines can be made a static object more dynamic .
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently .
the horizontal mirr@@ oring and mirr@@ oring options can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions .
with the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the auxiliary lines can become invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can do this with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing and tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences knob , you can reset the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after turning a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Transform@@ ers cut from image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic crop function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smoo@@ thes the image a bit after the rotation . note , however , the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tival transform@@ ations are performed at a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : shows the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
corner left above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
corner right above : indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
corner left below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
corner right below : indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image is a little gre@@ ased . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers cut from the image processing .
the loos@@ ening tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction . for example , the upper part of the image is shifted to the right and the lower part to the left . this is no rotation , the image is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
draw your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the loos@@ ening tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is blur@@ red . for a single calibration this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two lines producing twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after lubrication , the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cutting from image processing .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug ;
because of this depen@@ dency on other libraries it is impossible to give here a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF below .
&amp; edited ; shows only files in formats that you know . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of those with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; edited ; you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; edited ; please refer to the Con@@ figuration section for more information .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ plug ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally there are better , smoo@@ ther results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please refer to Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ plug ; see the Con@@ figuration section for more information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ plug ; .
&amp; edited ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ kam . hereby , more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all support cameras can be seen below on Dave Coff@@ in &apos;s web page . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; edited :
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ kam ; is not a film editing program and therefore does not have any built @-@ in options to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; Edit ; the &amp; k@@ de ; Use settings to play movies to start playing .

if you change the steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can perform the first four adjustment with the module white balance .
many tools you need to make photo editing are included in &amp; digi@@ plug ; your description follows here .
all image processing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tening , noise reduction , re@@ focuss@@ ing , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialogue type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture modi@@ fies &amp; quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it , five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontally split without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the top area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; style : shows preview if the mouse is not in preview and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons which you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and drop it on the part of the image you want to preview the preview . preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data come from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or zoom out or hold it and move it . move it while holding the left mouse button . all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used for editing color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pal@@ ettes files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and hot user defined color and last used colors .
in the Portfolio dialog , you can select from a list of installed pallets , or browse the folders for files .
the cursor is shown in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color beside it . the color is described under the pallet view . here the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used to select . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box In@@ m cursor is activated under the button color , the color is past@@ ed from the color panel on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ writing . this mode can be set by selecting the check box over@@ writing under the cursor cursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions to copy , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line @-@ end character , if another color follows . if so , three figures in the clip@@ board can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; diagrams . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program included &amp; X@@ 11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot . the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration into &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph will be calculated and displayed in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component to open
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems starting about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot :
as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; can also note your decision , so that it will be used later . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ cally ; see also .
when you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer , or eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but change it later with the setup dialog .
when you run the program , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the portions of the graph that come on one page will be adjusted to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph .
page preview with one on several pages distributed graph@@ ene without head@@ line and with another font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load site gives the option to specify behavior when a file was altered to the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or program the program every time .
the Open site provides the ability to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub @-@ window of the already running session ) or determine that every time it is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not ) or specify a default behavior ( the files from the last session or not ) or determine to be asked at each start afterwards .
the context menu , which usually appears with a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up further possibilities :
here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered graphs of directional graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for non @-@ aligned graph@@ ene . it produces representations based on the spring spring model . it uses the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm , which is syn@@ onymous with statisti@@ c multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a boun@@ ce spring model for ung@@ rounded graphs . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm as@@ signs the k@@ not circul@@ arly in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give &amp; eg ; den &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; algorithms perform special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of the graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for numbered graphs ) .
if this option is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .
displays the What is the -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse @-@ cursor click a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; Graph@@ vi@@ z ; tools to display . it requires the following program packages :
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid , in which you draw the symbol .
creates a new icon . if the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose to create the symbol from a template , or if you want to start anew from scratch .
re@@ stores the last revers@@ ed step . if you did not make a step backward , this function is disabled .
insert the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current icon in gray scales . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol Palette .
does not change the symbol , but sets the current drawing color to the color of the dot you click .
the status bar shows the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
insert the contents of the clip@@ board as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialogue with the three pages templates for icons , background and symbol grid .
with the Add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove , you can modify the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .
select Transpar@@ ent pixel or display lin@@ e@@ els and set in color : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as transparency display . you can also choose the size for the chess board : select the car@@ os on small , Medium and Large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you open the scanned image , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear by replacing the default duc@@ ts default values to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , lower corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed .
after pressing the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image .
screen shots you can create after you have selected in the Im@@ por@@ ter &gt; Screen photo menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ station . if you have selected the entire desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ spaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog of the target image appears with the options already described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to send his photos to people that are important to you . you can show your favorite photos of the world , make photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be led by the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so , it is your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is launched to allow you to login to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after the successful registration the module can send pictures to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
when the module ex@@ porting to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which shows the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . currently , the module does not support any other per@@ missions .
the button lets you add photos once you have set all other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , the upload of the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server starts .
the keywords field can be filled with a comm@@ a @-@ del@@ im@@ ited list of words . these are added to the image as key words during high loading .
with the options open , friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can adjust the access per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the option Modi@@ fy the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos before up@@ loading will be changed in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the geographical location of the K@@ IP@@ I module allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF section of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic loc@@ alization module provides tools for loc@@ ating ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ ati@@ tude are used here .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS trace as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images together with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the top @-@ to @-@ see dialog will then appear . in order to result in a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera length must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera zone here .
the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below the data is merged together . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next , you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set by the displayed card . select the region in question and increase si@@ e.@@ Run this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to allow for the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab sel@@ ector allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the sample preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page .
the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . the option for each image creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page . if you then click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer ,
the Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course it also affects the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nail allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Ri@@ der for thumb@@ nails , which are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
when the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occurred during the creation . the web browser will be automatically launched at the end to preview the preview of the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . for example , this can be found in the P@@ NG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ Team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy from the main program and then invo@@ ke the Import function . this then opens the file selection dialog where you want to copy the target image .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into each target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please refer to i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file in the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of images or the content of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre@@ configured and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that displays a picture . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as soon as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the button . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the Sli@@ deshow when you are back .
if an indication appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings right below .
the print wizard allows you to print multiple images on one sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is , for example , useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module directly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats of JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect from d@@ cra@@ w not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera creator . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the raw file to convert and launch the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the essential parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect .
once you &apos;re satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the fil@@ en@@ ame will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TI@@ FF , retains all information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or later use them elsewhere , you shouldn &apos;t choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose to JPEG as a storage format , the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG data in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the trigger button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el .
the batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , they have the possibility to over@@ write existing file automatically . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the orientation of the image . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size .
non @-@ proportional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . this option changes the aspect ratio .
preparation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images in advance .
after you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images to the images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be displayed on the right .
you can also drag images to the list of images and drop them there to add the list of images to be sent .
with the button removal , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the OK button . you only have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you selected are attached as attachments .
pay attention not to sending too many images at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of sending emails . it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending images . your configuration is stored and used again each time you change them .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in an attached file , the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added the mail .
the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG under Pictures file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can see the status messages on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Sli@@ deshow , a window with questions like you would like to have displayed your slide show appears . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL @-@ Transi@@ tions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the file name option displays that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop . you can then manually cancel it with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select make sure that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the images in the album .
the time interval between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 mil@@ lis@@ ec@@ onds are equal to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , each transition between images chooses a different effect .
during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the upper left edge of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn on .
with this toolbar you can pause the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the left bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the location of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have any documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Back@@ ground is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected sub@@ menu option , as a background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; browse through these , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , there are now in every group , i.e. in people , places and in group keywords .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse on the entry , the view of the browser will change . see picture .
if you select another person you will only see the images on which both persons are to be seen . by this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single pictures .
if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can use thumb@@ nails to view the images of your sphere of activity .
in the image , each person has the same symbol in front of their name . they can store their own thumb@@ nail with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , but this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture .
to view images next to the names , select the button located on the right of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable pictures for your keywords ) .
however , you must choose which image should be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the image view window ( in more detail ) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu . now you can select the image for the corresponding person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off .
when you enter the Find entry in the main window , a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the image again .
if you enter a string in the lab@@ eling or description field , the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total dat@@ as , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the bottom of the window you can search all pictures by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here is shown on pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the User Manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functionality , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and watch the fast entry , screen@@ shots and introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; launch demo . then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try them .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the Homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name says , it displays date statistics on the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview toolbar ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the tim@@ est@@ amps . if you select an area , preview only images of this time period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides two possibilities to create HTML pages with your pictures . the one is available in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML ... menu .
before creating HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout , and finish . in the following , each area is described more precisely .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML @-@ sample pages you can see an example of these settings .
next select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created which is visible on the overview page .
finally , you can select which information to appear on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; currently , all images are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why it is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 do not need to download images , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set . so you can search your images with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting , you specify the various folders and the URL where your site is stored .
best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and next time automatically added . this allows you to select the location for all future images . here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if these are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . to enable the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs . a sub@@ folder will be created in them , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images . however , if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information , people on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you need to do this work with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file , which can import others into your database .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a short@@ cut to images . the advantage of storing all the images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and share this file so independently . however , the obvious draw@@ back is the file size .
you can create a .@@ k@@ in file either directly from the File Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in a tw@@ o@@ fold way . first , it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
the following describes the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can access via the File Export menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
if you want to copy manually to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying , for example , that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File Im@@ por@@ ter menu , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the im@@ porting images are to be copied .
it may be that you specify the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the file to be imported and which categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can reconci@@ le the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture .
it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual , you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) setting the information about your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program to manage your pictures , but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but often this also includes videos .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copying to a disk or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want them .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder where your images are stored and automatically re@@ use it for future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
via the Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will find the various settings options .
to the left you can see six different icons , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting there is a detailed help available , which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums .
you can see the dialog used to process existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group set at once in a group rather than all groups of a member like explained in .
in the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this modular system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . more information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; but most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules are used together by multiple applications , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own images The &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; demo database can be accessed either by command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules use via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , so it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not working . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications record their images in albums : an album is simply a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order of albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all images that show you the picture preview right now .
in addition to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have to pass a list of albums . here &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then every entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so whether you would have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used from any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and a toolbar at the top . under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . currently , we will return to this window , but now click on the pictures to show you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each image with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture , where the image was taken . you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously .
all these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you will always use them once more , when you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on shifting the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are m@@ apped , you can find that the names used are moved up to find and assign people more quickly .
if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the Sor@@ ting icon after the date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons below the image to the right .
if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S. , and San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window displaying the USA as an overview . to show you that it is an over@@ board , a special symbol is displayed .
in the Comment di@@ alogs context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub @-@ category . in addition , you can simply drag and drop an entry to a sub@@ category of this entry .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window pane .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button . among other things , you can save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to get this window being displayed again later , use the button options ... and here you can see the window in / out . this process can be seen in the picture .
if you select the pictures in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you have not set a filter . for example , you can see the size of thumb@@ nails , by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button , configur@@ ing it . just try it .
if you drop an image on the background of your desktop , this image is set as background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , this will be shown in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ove button or select Del@@ ete Sel@@ ection from the Edit menu . now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use the images somewhere , thus &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard disk .
images in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk . however , for the images 5 @-@ 9 the thumb@@ nails are present , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view these images as well . you can also not view these images with the picture viewer .
as you see this feature requires that you copy files from the folders and then copy them back into it . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to avoid irritation about how to avoid mixing your images , please purchase a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the Image menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those remain who wish to make you in@@ accessible for others and click Current View locking in the Privacy Menu . alternatively , you can also select all the images that your little sister may view , and lock the menu item except current view .
with this you have set which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item pictures to lock , so that all the images that you have locked are hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which needs to be typ@@ ed to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select the password from the privacy menu .
for one , everyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml may read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar with the view to private pictures .
the reason you are all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider it sometime . for this reason &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; via an image _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
the viewer can see you . it naturally shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was done , etc .
if you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can also drag and drop them somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all of these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
some words in the Info@@ Box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the appropriate entries for this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be accessed from the context menu .
if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is it able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete place on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can move in and out into the image . you can easily pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . the plus key zo@@ oms in in the middle of the picture . shows how a zo@@ oming rect@@ angle is marked and shows the zo@@ oms result .
with the point key you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the Sync button sets the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes on the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter . in this you see a picture where the characters A , B and C are set .
once you have put features on your pictures , they are available to you in your browser . so if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add them all at once with notes . this is described in . after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview view . if you let categories display in a preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case you allow &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in order to switch the painting mode from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the picture from the context menu . to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient but the documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an already selected object , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the correct position :
del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit , or from the right mouse button context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and then click Apply or disc@@ ard the changes with Canc@@ el .
if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press a preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the texture selected . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you wish to render a part of the texture ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is shown in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as absolute value . objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level selected in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement , you can set it arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple windows orders and simply switch between different arrangements .
to anchor a window above or below a present view , drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle indicates the new position .
to create a new column , drag the starter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , you drag the starter in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window order is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to resolve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the cham@@ fer@@ ing bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place .
you can save the current window view with View window order ... save it . it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 is up @-@ to @-@ date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported .
to render the current scene , click on Ren@@ dering The Ren@@ dering icon in the toolbar , or select Ren@@ dering the View Sc@@ ene menu item .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar , or in the View R@@ ender mode ... select , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense to use a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
in the box map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the quality drop down menu you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a ray per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because of the super @-@ sampling the neighboring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively , because each pixel is repeatedly broken down and adaptive because the rec@@ u@@ per@@ ation depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you select the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam of pixels . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference then is :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre@@ defined threshold , the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are further followed and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . when you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for ren@@ der@@ ns quality is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection calcul@@ ates . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly finished , you can find the reason here .
to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray scene , select File Im@@ por@@ ter ... and select a file in the dialog window .
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command scope of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; want to import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Begin and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can include source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on help in the property view , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . set the path to your document and the version here . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( such as elevation field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type features .
you can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail for two directions separately .
if you cross High detail fi@@ del@@ ity for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this feature results in a better approach for projections , but requires more time for rendering .
if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
when you cross the floor , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours .
if you tick edge smoo@@ thing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing windows orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders , it explains how you can create and save window orders .
the standard window order drop down : displays all existing window arrangements . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing windows arrangements . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views for the selected window order . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Rem@@ ove button .
with New column , you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with card board you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating up the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start with no more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this tutorial , you should be able to create the ultimate yet simple scene , among beginners is very popular : a sphere on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black image .
if you don &apos;t include sources of light , your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black image .
if you have installed everything error free , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons . please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this tutorial first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item . so you now have a scene without objects .
the view of the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view shows you the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation on &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see for more details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera . simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position .
when you press the user button or the Enter key , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a box ( insert final body boxes ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some way to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as a floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or Enter . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , even if at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane will expand up to the horizon .
when you view the object tree exactly , you will notice that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only find the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift .
in this scene you should move the floor to the practice a unit under the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows :
first select the floor to set its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases , a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object . the pigment is then displayed in the property tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the pigment preview only shows a matte black material because you have to input settings for the pigment . always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the Qu@@ ader and Sphere in the preview , then click on the Apply button and then go to the Pre@@ view button .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result :
of course this is not the color you expected . here are more settings necessary . in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
choose the color in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already do this step , since you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be easily done just like the floor :
in view of object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , as you have moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
once you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the ground , give the sphere a pigment as color :
choose the first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment . click on sphere pigment , then select Col@@ ors and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the adjustment of gloss effect and reflection already results in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal is not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ ing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical beams from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is just black . obviously , every scene you want to be row@@ ed requires , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and disk space .
re@@ covers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage is dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ing command . you can only select this menu item if you have used editing automatically .
stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , the short@@ cuts and the default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can use this option to modify default short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . you can add and remove tool icons for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; add and remove commands .
a B@@ ump @-@ Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel based , by applying an image file as a color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
using &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking on the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a particular file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in dialogue Con@@ figuration - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ de Show , you can set the modus oper@@ and@@ i of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in both other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
is this point activated , loads &amp; balls show ; already the next image in the folder , while you still look at the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in the window mode the window is larger than the picture , the background is filled with the selected color .
you can set up &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; to set up only some of the file types that the program can display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is enabled as default .
specifies whether the slide show should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or small arrows right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or small arrows right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of activity of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for your browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short description .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the picture .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the images . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed if no browser window is open anymore .
show the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ foto ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo editing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; editing . &amp; show@@ foto ; is part of the &amp; edited ; project .
show@@ Photo ; is a fast image editing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ foto ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to at least problems and possible improvements .
show@@ Photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu contains an entry to report problems or requests . if you use it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . all the information you need is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ Photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user of show@@ graph , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions about other users of &amp; show@@ foto . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to join &amp; show@@ foto ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ foto ; .
show@@ Photo ; tries to give you as much control over its work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of show@@ graph ; to access these settings , you will need to set up the Settings show@@ foto . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display the colors with what you should display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of the show@@ picture ; has a side@@ bar on the right edge , which provides important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side@@ bar in image editing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that do not make more than scan and save images .
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make more than scan and save images . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image or save the images immediately in a given folder with automatically generated name and format .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; with the command h@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog box for selecting the scanner is opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel &amp; chant ; quit .
the other settings include more detailed options of the driver . &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options very much .
to scan a picture , the user can start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview button is started by the preview button .
to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
when the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
if a preview is displayed in the settings before saving , then the image is displayed in a preview window as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image is saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demo@@ lition and you return to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image , if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving . if this preview is not desired by the user then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; to select images . open dialog for each image opens the dialog before each scanned image . if you want to save them automatically with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking a fil@@ en@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder will be used as default for the dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... Change .
this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images to be stored automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix which is displayed every time a picture is saved . the string # # # will be replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE help with the &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings shows the dialog for settings and closing can be used to quit &amp; chant .
&amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by the client under L@@ GP@@ L . note : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of short@@ cuts and their function . you can set up the global key short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting Global short@@ cuts . you can set up the key short@@ cuts by right @-@ clicking in the player window and set short@@ cuts .
you can set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . a sample call for the D@@ CO@@ P function break could look like this :
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command @-@ line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of depen@@ dency . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script is not running .
begin require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ ale Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script .
in the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most of the scrip@@ ting languages allow external programs and commands to be executed . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings should be written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if it has no use for it .
configure Sets the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change signals that a new piece is being played . the script could now and z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , additional information about the new piece ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volume Change new@@ Volume signals a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Ke@@ eps the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a user @-@ defined menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry to the menu , you can use the D@@ CO@@ P feature d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( Sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , e.g. storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the suff@@ icing amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should correctly name your script packages .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file per@@ missions :
if your script package is finished , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re just searching for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists but can never decide which one you want to listen to ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , choose the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player .
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used . see the System Requirements section for details .
activ@@ ates de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; lets you set up the setup dialog without effort . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
show player windows in addition to the playlist and / or exit the player window . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok has been compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the tuning bar@@ ometer .
drag files to the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) .
external browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
use other browsers : you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save Play@@ list when you exit , automatically stores the current playlist at the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist at the end of the playlist .
relative paths to manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep up @-@ to @-@ date play in the play @-@ out causes the playlist to pop up / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when changing the context browser , automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font list , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . by selecting O@@ wn scripts , the otherwise gray presented section is enabled . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist windows , player windows , and context browsers . press Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
by selecting Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector , which has been activated , for foreground and background color .
resume playback when you start , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , resume playback with the piece at the point where it was stopped at the last end .
the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display enables you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is used , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be shad@@ owed in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards the O@@ SD can be adjusted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ in@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment should appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio @-@ output flash@@ card lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate more settings in this tab card .
the card collection collection is used to set all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folders , the &amp; Amar@@ ok , search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders .
search sub@@ folder recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to search both the critics and their sub@@ folders for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all play@@ lists found in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is required .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l device section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : will enter the computer on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is made .
use username : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card contains the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
sending off played pieces and updating the profile : this setting enables &amp; Amar@@ ok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar performers : after activating this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar performers to the played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the features and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs .
some functions such as the O@@ SD pres@@ upp@@ ose that your window manager considers the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ k@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause difficulties for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because these provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also app@@ end the file that caused the crash .
usually this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ info from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more sophisticated .
make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok are compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b was compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will result in crashes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable automatic switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will automatically open in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash , and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ information , but they do not flag as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten . adjust the status de@@ activ@@ ates to gray and semi@@ transparent . note that in some cases , you must click a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok uses the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which cat@@ oc@@ app _ _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable to seek help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok , only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there now ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the Start sub@@ window has been transformed into the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras Statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for evaluation by the user while points are calculated automatically .
to rate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column view rating . click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for one piece . you can also use the Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; short commands . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove , and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Play@@ list from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and let them fall there exactly as you would do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , the button playlist is stored . click on it .
probably the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config is missing . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer can be found in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be : what media types supports G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ M ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and p@@ ng !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are supplied ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ sink , the device must provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and at the same time output audio . this can be achieved by using a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ se@@ sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send a MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes your data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this bug report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts Code@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less iner@@ tia the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer you have to register all the components . carry out the follow @-@ up register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the G@@ Stre@@ amer module folder ( you will find the module folder with you @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report to us at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and run the alarm to this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command leaves &amp; Amar@@ ok ; playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft sounds of the music you have stopped prior to bed .
how do I get to know the current song in &amp; Amar@@ ok , when you &apos;re on another computer ?
if there is a working SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the current piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user _ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes your identification is present in ~ / .@@ ss@@ h / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; windows can be separated . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button represents a piece in the click order in the queue . pressing Enter to search in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the Control Panel &apos;s system section ?
click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database can &apos;t be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play on Audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading , go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg .

basically this fits the previous evaluation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking with the right button of the mouse on a column heading in the playlist window . there you can change the rating of a piece as well , namely by clicking with the right button of the mouse on the piece and editing : select or press F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Met@@ adata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified release plan that is not associated with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok , which some users can easily find ner@@ vi@@ g . disable the option icon when playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select set up toolbar ... and take the desired changes there .

if you want to use AL@@ SA then please the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports .
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ?
you probably have to use a distribution that will install the development files separated from the actual program . even though G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . you must now install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install again .
I receive the bug G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix this ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without a shr@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I get an error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .

I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok the second sound@@ card ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output gives you the device . typically , for example , h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with a on@@ board AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
p@@ c@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; ct@@ l.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 } p@@ c@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , des@@ elect the check@@ box on sound card supports m@@ map .
sorry , but the audio output with arts is not supported any further . you can of course take this problem yourself into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed main@@ tain@@ er for Arts : )

the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation area . in the navigation area you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser .
the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and artist . the context browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and artist .
if you have previously used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you may notice that the bottom @-@ window has fallen away . the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . furthermore , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) .
the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the artist and the album .

to display cover images in context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ p@@ ng formats are supported . the context browser will also display covers images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next area , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on any of these pieces , it will play immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favorite pieces of this performer . this section shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .

this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if no text script runs , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database , no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the lyrics for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group@@ ing - group@@ ing only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing artist / album - First the pieces are sorted by artist and below will be a further distribution according to the respective album . if you want to see compositions or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under various performers .
group@@ ing artist / year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically by each other . the performer is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces are displayed first by genre and among them by artist .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting functions as well as the above , but is additionally sorted by album under the performer .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the collection settings . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folder . if you own a lot of pieces , this might take a while .
there is a search filter right below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . notice how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a drop @-@ down box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to a year .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you get the following options .
load - This will emp@@ ower the current playlist and add the selected pieces in the currently valid order in the playback .

( n ) Move files to the garbage b@@ ins ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under various performers .
picking up a selection - Chan@@ ges a record marked as a compilation album back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be displayed under different performers but under the respective interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes the handling of many play@@ lists quite easy . among other things , it also contains smart play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the playlist browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
you can also add created smart play@@ lists . click Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist . there you can enter all the criteria for your new playlist .
the media player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by performer , sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to the list Interpre@@ t . if you are finished , click Apply . thus , the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is completed , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod .
under the toolbar there is a search area where you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from an entered URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z , you can access music in the file musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simple dropping . in this case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert lost files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all the pieces you want to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all the search terms . for example , if you enter one two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter the OR between the search terms , it is searched for entries containing either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with ge@@ ese feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ . This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : - Som@@ e@@ thing looks for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variants with each other as you wish . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bath . this is looking for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist items .
next , the buttons will follow and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar there is a unique , expanding analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that which you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok , &apos; s configuration .
there are many more buttons available for the toolbar , for example ren@@ dition controls and volume controls . you can set up the buttons shown by clicking on the menu and set up toolbar ...
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed simply by double clicking the mouse button in the appropriate display area .
you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . using this menu , you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plug window . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok .
behind this entry is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the Cover Administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by choosing actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the Cover Administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu you can choose what should be displayed in the cover administration . select from :
the queue management received your big move into &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you will have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece in the queue , a number will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on .
if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( details for setting up these follow later ) .
fill up your playlist with random items from your entire collection and add more random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to operate this dynamic playlist .
double click on the playlist you want , drag it into the playlist window or right @-@ click on it and then select &quot; Load . &quot; in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist . you should , under certain circumstances , save the old playlist !
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list mix instantly complete your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist receiving pieces starts with an empty playlist and you need to add at least one piece itself from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added at the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . using the same menu entry , dynamic mode can also be disabled again .
the New button cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit play@@ lists will open the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the option to click Edit . as a result , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not be heard in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed , taking into account the setting Songs .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be stored at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have recently been played .
this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the right @-@ hand settings are already described in the previous section . on the left @-@ hand side of the dialog , you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random items from each of the selected play@@ lists .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking Settings .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . after installing the script , a new entry will appear in the list . once you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 Decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code@@ c for loss@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module , allowing you to read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , ff@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with ff@@ m@@ peg it is possible for example to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ x Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : an auth@@ oring system fully equipped for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can result in an unpleasant effect that the pieces of music will be played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically play all the videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ load recently opened projects . the corresponding sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise a new file name will be asked .
saves the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog storage is displayed , which allows you to select the folder and fil@@ en@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file Save .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what will happen . you can then choose between storing and making changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project , just as if you had called for each project file closing .
closes all opened projects and closes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project it is asked what to do with it as if you have called a file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project by the appearing dialog . that has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Project Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is that ? -@@ help described ( achiev@@ able by right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session to the current project . this is useful when you are not using files for a multi @-@ session CD .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove any files from the medium , it only hides the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD onto another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can create only a copy of a CD that you can then burn later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this enables copying a DVD to another medium , even without a project file . alternatively , you can also create only one copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later . the converting / reduction of a DVD with the help of copying a DVD is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD + R ( W ) , which will delete the content completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between write modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
the dialog promp@@ ts you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button . ( Ner@@ o * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burning a previously created DVD image . the dialog promp@@ ts you for an * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the Burn button .
a previously loaded DVD video can be converted . this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even possibilities for changing size and cutting black edges .
displays information about the submitted media . this information is displayed in the content view and includes features of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of toolbar units of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
when this is checked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and un@@ locking the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in folder view .
the head@@ line is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can change the key signature to it below .
this will start k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for system administrator ( root ) when the wizard is started .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work right away . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine @-@ adjust the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality for example can be controlled via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line , or the slightly more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and style of your task is crucial to which of the contribut@@ or programs you prefer .
in this chapter we assume you are using the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you need to make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then type something like the following in the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have all &amp; k@@ de ; program in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ting DVD and other features for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DVD Project ( ) void copy@@ rights ( ) void bur@@ n@@ c@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ image ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project @-@ method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the above K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void la@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ l , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ UR@@ ur@@ ls , Q@@ String Transpar@@ ent ) void reg@@ ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then inserts files into the new folders :
# ! / bin / b@@ ash PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT statement / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; k@@ de ; . with it can easily be audio CD ; s read and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders encoding those wa@@ v files ( compression ) . currently l@@ ame is supported for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) .
first , the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss @-@ free and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or also to other formats like loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is being used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions but it is probably not necessary to install something yourself .
which encoding / file format should be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ver gives a small introduction to enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . in any case , &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection . simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be inv@@ oked as often up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD will be explained later . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble over at the beginning .
can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; fet@@ ches information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is only a short list of the main window commands . for example , there are more information on how this program is used , as well as screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for configur@@ ing the program .
launches the CD@@ DB request of CD data in accordance with the establishment of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
starts reading and - if a encoder is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default . it must be noted that the En@@ co@@ der has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
open the file manager so that an already read file is selected to en@@ code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as logs , pic@@ ots ) for program events ( like reading the &amp; CD ; finished ) .
opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , for setting the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes tone quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . in addition to FLA@@ C , there are others like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but over this bit rate , the differences become less important since both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless provided with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG play devices is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format .
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . takes up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate around 5.5 . still needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate around 11 128 k@@ bps for all songs of a song . good enough for music from you@@ ths , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or fet@@ ched through the program from the fre@@ ed@@ b over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / are used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the &amp; CD title to keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs instead of entering the information instead of entering the computer . it must be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artist , name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : this means the author ) bin not attorney . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b it can be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address as the one installed in the system . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( this can only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which select program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . to note is that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this has not yet happened .
to save the selected wa@@ v files , the encoder and therefore the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab to set up the encoder . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab yourself .
the encoding package needs to be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined encoder .
after installing a encoder , you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) .
this can have many causes . check the device description of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , write and reading real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio encoding of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . that could give an indication of what is wrong .
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the cover of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step @-@ by @-@ step example . even if you use other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure of what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) .
you have to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can for example be found with a search engine , as it is considered as non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write privileges on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD .
here we determine the encoder to comp@@ ress the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them in any reading of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device identi@@ fier is passed to the reader program to read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device identi@@ fier of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device desig@@ nations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
the card general settings . there is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left as shown / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
select only for incomplete information , so you will be informed when information about creating keywords ( tags ) is missing .
the cardboard card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; download data automatically via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the fre@@ ed@@ b server while reading the &amp; CD .
the second drop down box is simpler , becomes a &amp; CD ; entry found , immediately starts reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you later are un@@ happy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory and fil@@ en@@ ame is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; tag and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , disable the selection boxes and fre@@ ed@@ b is not used . however , this is about 6@@ 20 MB big , consider this twice as this is worthwhile . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection boxes need to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card board .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to receive the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b . set everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org page and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls bo@@ cken the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 because the TCP / HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to send any &amp; CD ; data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take over the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously reading pieces : excuse , is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , so simply try himself .
disc@@ ard CD ; after reading the last piece : tick this to the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard at the end of the process .
custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then the path / folder must be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files are created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wa@@ v files yourself .
enter everything in the same way as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , something needs to be fli@@ pped to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted as needed . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section it describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; to the hard drive runs off . we will create and set up MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard drive , was written in the previous section and set up . first , a connection to the internet is established as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will be retri@@ eved .
since we use a &amp; CD ; that is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look slightly different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD now has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , check the FAQ and answers to the Help section or go back to the previous section on the basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully obtained from the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives , a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fetch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of CD data and title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Update title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Update title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the bottom comment field can be used for individual comments or individual pieces , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply collectively for all pieces of the CD .
note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b , the CD editor is not empty , it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this option will be set on the encoding settings section ; take a look at the &apos; Core Settings &apos; section .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that is apparent with the style of the read @-@ on CD ; in this example it is not important since we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to the web site of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the Windows editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear when you download the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the parts list .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches on or off the selection of the piece . make sure all the pieces are selected , or press the All Parts button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
was started by clicking the button Select the selection process , this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what &apos;s going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the toolbar buttons .
this is the window to control the orders . the first piece is just read to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
this error message lets you see if you are trying to work with a coding that you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the list of orders .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read out and code parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . for low @-@ performance machines , the result is unclear .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . res@@ p . 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maintained in the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the k@@ de@@ multimedia package . if you are familiar with CVS , you can download from there an anonymous copy . however , most distri@@ butions include already a pre @-@ compiled package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; install the package k@@ de@@ multimedia from your distribution . if you read this , you probably already did it ...
this section is aimed at people who compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package for their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs when it &apos;s running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls for many different programs has many variations of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any indication of how to go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately , no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; intended . whoever wants to add or modify something useful may do it . at least until after cont@@ acting with the author . and if you read this , he left this section and therefore agrees with this proposal .
strange if you have managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de , SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke player of &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it has real @-@ time graphic and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of lyrics also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also support &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( rec@@ lam@@ ation or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the method used .
session support . when you exit &amp; k@@ de ; during the playing of a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song again next time .
supports external MIDI syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; this works also with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the Play button in the toolbar , select the play from the menu item , or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and change the playback speed . to restore the original tempo , double @-@ click the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu piece , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type will be automatically determined that uses a song , so you don &apos;t have to manually adjust the kar@@ a@@ oke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way .
if you want to specify an event type , select the entries text events or rec@@ tile events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze , which will be played in the series . in this section you can see how to use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the Collection Manager . you can find it in the Collection menu under the point Organ@@ ize .... Click on New and specify the collection name .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection .
if you have more than one collection , you can set each one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when you leave the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song to the Add a button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied . this collection is then added to the still opened pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Rem@@ ove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the row from the sub@@ menu selection sequence of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text .
to jump a song further , select the Next Song button , select next song from the menu item or press the arrow key to the right .
to jump back a song , select the button Pre@@ y piece , the entry Pre@@ y piece from the menu piece or press the arrow key to the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers that are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) .
there are no programs available to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI @-@ Map is a text file that stores all the necessary re@@ aliz@@ ations for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except for the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section will start ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
in this section you can see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all tones that this instrument needs to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . to do this , enter the following into the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section :
so if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant , where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument .
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence . so you have to create 128 entries .
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map tones to the perc@@ ussions channel . see , for example , the provided key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swap the first and second channels , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI to channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel which is m@@ apped to the N channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map will be used with the name name for that channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored , which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , this is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then rel@@ a@@ yed only . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM tells that a keyboard that gets a pitch use event is supposed to play a pitch higher with 40@@ 96 . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave up . to find the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog , which can be found in the Settings menu , point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are played straight .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has two different views ( up to now ) to display the played sounds . view the view from the Settings menu under the point Channel view : settings
the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the tempo of a song . so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support compiled . to solve the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually .
simply drag and drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window .
first , make sure to set Automatic Add to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the standard tempo , double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; windows with my MIDI @-@ folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( when I play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) , I only need to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; switch the window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you want to listen to a file only once , without adding it to a collection , turn on the Automatic Add to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection .
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ M. , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so , set the setup Automatic Add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then you decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid .
&amp; k@@ mid ; written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; made of Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to make MIDI files , make music and prove phrases .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kara@@ oke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an enlargement of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
they really make me happy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ a@@ oke file from a local group . all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will contact with friends by &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file already .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money from anyone . I would like to stress that I only get more programming because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also goes to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ theim , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a fault alert or even a supporting e @-@ mail .
and of course my thanks also apply to all these outstanding musicians on the web , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ a@@ oke files .
in addition to this can be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and see pictures . you will also find there links to sites with other kar@@ a@@ oke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , because the sound quality depends substantially on your sound card . it is not the same whether you are using an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; compile with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then works as if you have a sound card , unless you can of course listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and ff@@ m@@ peg . the program is used for playback of video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playing DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the documentation for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; k@@ app@@ Name ; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned in it .
it is possible to save the preferred links under the Book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Play@@ list .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level . if you select an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the selected entry .
the categories &apos; current play &apos; , TV and permanent play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; not running . the various files in the directory ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / , can also be changed by an editor , then select from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing x@@ ml files , you have to select a playlist from the S@@ ame menu and select either the Edit Mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; K@@ M@@ Player , some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modi@@ fying &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; will be aware of the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / K@@ M@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would fail during the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ d ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ bo@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / body@@ suit ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of K@@ M@@ Player . here is the output of mp@@ layer .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file , such as setting the back@@ end using mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played using the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; it can even add the special field em@@ bed to YouTube in the playlist XML .
for the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; module as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file Zu@@ ordin@@ ations of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors here , the Back@@ end Edition is inside &amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu to check ) .
so that a given back@@ end is taken for a particular mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c file . for example , Phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files :
&amp; K@@ M@@ Player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure V@@ DR ( Video Data Recorder ) settings in the K@@ M@@ Player , the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there should be detected ports from which one is selected . the code to be used must be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of K@@ M@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be supported for the X server . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must contain the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) :
internally , several names are used by K@@ M@@ Player for the sources . at the time of creating this documentation , this dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ resource .
is there any hint that I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is a user root to run after plug@@ ging the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure / dev / c@@ drom is shown on the CD@@ ROM drive .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; kick .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems , probably the package &amp; lyrics ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) is used .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; installation should be included in the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . they allow easy installation without further complic@@ ation and are included on the box ; website included .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly need to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the Ki@@ le ; website should be established .
if you have any questions or if you wish to compile &amp; drop , this should be addressed to the mailing list Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical surface and within this a simple , immediate and customized access to all &amp; latex programs . in conclusion , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; latex ; reference and the powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; Po@@ sters ; and to learn about its possibilities the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
for &amp; latex ; is the right language : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex ; difficult to use , a lay@@ man can also use mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while there is only a good over@@ sight to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for this . to be able to control properly , good books should be used e.g. H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Start Assistant by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an useful feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; selecting the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) provides some possibilities for creating the document . some of the settings can also be made to the document .
document classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; PDF &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : with this the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used add @-@ on packages for natural latex ; they only have to be selected in the check box .
articles ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . they should always be used in the preparation of German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - as well as other source text editors - high@@ lighting the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is saved by the modest appearance of the output file anyway .
with the automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line to the lie@@ uten@@ ant of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be disabled in the settings box ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled .
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the document to be sub@@ divided into the following elements ( the highest and the most sub@@ paragraph is the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex files , the check search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file is created , skip &amp; drop ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the standard output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices .
when using the check search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected with the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked into the DVI ; file , the exact opposite is used . as soon as a section is cli@@ cked in the &amp; latex ; source code is cli@@ cked , the corresponding point in the DVI ; viewer j@@ umped .
master document : this function is used for working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set on project project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; latex ; source is compiled and the result is displayed automatically ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
file monitoring : in this mode , the DVI ; file is over@@ clo@@ cked and no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction .
when viewing the Edit Tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection boxes have been developed for the quick inclusion of common elements into the document . the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document into sections , chapters , sections , ... The available &amp; latex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are :
the Other is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes no@@ des or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a term is created for a section , an image , or a different element .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choice of a selection box possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can also be written by hand .
the last selection field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ e is used for the determination of the font size . it can be specified the font sizes for the main text , the joints , etc . the following fonts are available :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch .
the brackets after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font name . if the font name is not specified at the beginning , this can also happen later in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the simplest way to do this is using the Men@@ Ã ¼ s Building or the Button Fast@@ ening .
the source code must be saved prior to compile . &amp; Ki@@ le ; does the storage automatically execute .
if you fail to compile the document , you should search for errors in the recording . when using fast construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , logging in should also be considered .
an environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font . the command \ \ started { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } necess@@ it@@ ates the alteration of the font .
the changes are supervised only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end } . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , grease pressure , ital@@ ics pressure , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands can either end with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a phrase can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and concludes with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
after the background for writing the source text is presented with the &amp; latex mask , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; box ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , a few adjustments should be made to improve the read@@ ability of the document . for this purpose , min@@ d. a quote , a few positions in the fat and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem can be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl @-@ E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer the window has to be closed .
once the DVI ; file was created , the document can be printed out or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ ape ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th Step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI file into other formats . once the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex ; source code was created , the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the kno@@ bs in the toolbar .
the pre @-@ search feature allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all and latex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . for this purpose only Modern must be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools can be selected .
in order to execute the default search , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on the preview search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI ; viewer is then taken .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the appropriate &amp; latex ; open and jump to the appropriate line . for this purpose &amp; box ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; set as text editor ( configure the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if there is no error when using the &amp; DVI file system , there may be an error . if there is an error , this will be shown in the log file or in the message window .
the log file exec@@ utes the source code of the source code . in the editor , then the buttons of the La@@ Te@@ X error and the default La@@ Te@@ X error can be used for jumps between the errors . to view the faulty line , click on the error in logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jump to the defective line .
when cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will pop up to select the template to use for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can be re@@ written either from scratch or used to quickly create a new document . further information can be found in the section .
H@@ Ã ¤ u@@ fi@@ ge users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be placed in &amp; Ki@@ le ; created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file is opened or a new file is created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template by means of a file New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings General .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are sub@@ stituted by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document was created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard ones .
a template can be created from any and latex ; files created easily for creating a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and carried through the steps described below .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about it and its possibilities the manual of K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of &amp; kate .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; latex ; command reference that can be called via the Men@@ Ã ¼ T@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex , as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with a pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that clicking on \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with a pressed shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; latex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assistants can collect additional jump marks . these are a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items Edit J@@ ump marks or the respective keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump mark is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; kate ; features already excellent possibilities , were added into &amp; Ki@@ le ; used always many environments and groups and therefore supported &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit Settings , the following commands are included for selecting the text :
contains a complete paragraph ( group of rows containing an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only explo@@ iting thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the ab@@ sc@@ ings are separated by two blank lines .
the word is selected under the current cursor position . this selection also has an expanded meaning since this command also contains &amp; latex ; -@@ commands with a back scre@@ ened ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end .
to delete a part of the document , it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; kate ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility . under Edit Rem@@ ove the following commands to delete the text :
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit select paragraph .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more orders under Edit environment for a possible easy work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is located before or within the \ \ begin { environment } command , it will jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the over@@ views can be lost quickly . this command completes the last opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment is not destroyed .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command is used to jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the pad@@ lock .
if the cursor is in front or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , the group will jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
with the input of many ne@@ sted bra@@ i@@ ded groups @-@ brackets you can quickly lose the view above . this command completes the last opened group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the appropriate implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is used for two simple instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and serves two adjacent marks for &amp; latex ; one . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this automatic double @-@ entry badge can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
ad @-@ specific settings can also be used ( e.g. n@@ au@@ or french ) and thus German or French annex@@ es . there are also many other languages available .
for the shift of Shift , Enter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a line break but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a spread@@ sheet environment , close &amp; drop ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or custom environments . these can be set under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to sort the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby assign all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among themselves . &amp; Ki@@ le ; tries to make this possible . while this tab is unfortunately not the associated table , &amp; Ki@@ le ; some space for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; kate ; already offers a good source code completion , this has been added to &amp; ki@@ le ; there are three different modes installed . three of them work on demand and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different ways under Settings Ki@@ le ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
when starting a new environment by command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and , fortunately , the completion list increases . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command . alternatively , a jump to these positions can be added , so that a jump to these positions can be possible and the desired parameters can be entered .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Compl@@ et@@ ely you can make adjustments to these lists . you can select various wi@@ fes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands as well as wi@@ pes of the general language used .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . it must always be entered a few letters with \ \ begin and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of ambient conditions . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for the completion of environments available .
when calling the completion mode above the volume editing environment or the key / key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically filed and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient capacity can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of completion mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; -@@ commands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of deriv@@ atives , which can be replaced immediately through lower strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ Compl@@ et@@ n@@ ug . as an example of a replacement list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word completion mode is initiated above the editing process or the key C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar , the character L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string .
large wi@@ gs are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it was found that many wi@@ pers in one document are written more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written wi@@ re@@ ters .
this mode can be set up in the settings box ... Ki@@ le Compl@@ et@@ ely shiel@@ ded . here you can also set the threshold value for displaying the completion .
the completion files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / cart@@ le / complete / mode / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / etc / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
the graphic design dialog creates the impression of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be carefully considered .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can be re@@ arranged and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to examine the results of the work , the source code must be compiled . all tools are group@@ ed in groups in the Cre@@ ating , Imple@@ menting and Cre@@ ating View menus .
for compilation of source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used to Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI file can be viewed using Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into one PS file and be viewed using Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the command prompt , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project will be available on the Men@@ Ã ¼ project New Project .... In this case , the following information is available for the project :
when filling the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified from the .@@ kil@@ n project file .
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be administr@@ ated via scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be purchased in further versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = dump ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different aids to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; &amp; &amp; tex@@ as ; supplied with many documents , including a documentation for the packages included and another &amp; latex ; reference .
a complete re@@ ap@@ se for &amp; tex ; and for its &quot; registered &quot; friend . it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex commands and is therefore ideal for searching for a certain format@@ ting .
due to the amount of documents supplied with &amp; tet@@ ex ; / text live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ til ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all the to &amp; Ki@@ le ; delivered documents and here a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for package names or keywords . von &amp; Ki@@ le ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer to the document .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source editor available for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; k@@ de ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; Ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .
many thanks to those who asp@@ ire after the progress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project aiming for many hours for the development of tools we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; current information about the contribut@@ ors exist in the Men@@ Ã ¼ up@@ f &amp; Ki@@ le ; .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command line interface , you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . through many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails more varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is made from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day , you use it to use different signatures , as with the random signatures you create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this will give you an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and paste it in the lower section . signature @-@ sample Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org

anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has known my@@ pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . if we take it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more relies on a terminal ; simply cli@@ cked the icon for the XML processor and done !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is in the ear@@ nest working folder , then leave the current working folder cli@@ cked . if not , remove the current working folder and specify the folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files are deleted every time my@@ pro@@ c is started .
as I have said before , anyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , simply select the current working folder . if not , select the current job folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , its file is fla@@ wed . please check the bugs reported and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply cli@@ cked . if not , delete the check@@ box in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection .

type the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in its home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality right away and don &apos;t have to wait for someone to use the plugin in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . read more about it below .
to install a plugin or a part , we start editing plug@@ ins . this will open the following dialog :
this dialog enables you to manage all of the included plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this path to search the plug @-@ in .
many people often work on a project in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
a member may have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze + button . the currently selected member ( her identity ) appears fat after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important with regard to news and comments . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
in addition to an overview of your team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project , so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it , or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that takes a file into CVS , once it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
events can be created , edited and deleted on the event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
an E@@ Mail will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
input Notes is simple . it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text .
in this case , the syntax is @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , whereby nick@@ name is the chosen nick@@ name of the team member , role play a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project leader In the area and sub @-@ project leaders , the respective area or sub @-@ project names should be given , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but whit@@ esp@@ ace around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is DT@@ D @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only via &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; with regard to tags including car completion , this can be modified .
large / lower case @-@ case of tags : large / lower case case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower case @-@ case means that tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
upper@@ case / lo@@ wer@@ case of attributes : large / lower case @-@ case of automatically added attributes . normal size / lower case @-@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically close : if checked , it will be added to tags for which the closing tag is optional .
do not include optional tags automatically : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
automatically update start and finish day : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding coding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using the Def@@ ault button , the default settings can be restored .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) .
standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D has not been detected . however , this setting is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
create a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies regularly , so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
previ@@ ewing and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , making it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
reset the window settings to the default on the next start is useful when the user interface has changed by changing the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ext command line parameter .
the warning section is used to control the display of warnings by stop @-@ stop warning .
the place to change behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change it . it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the representation of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Stru@@ c@@ tural Settings section , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree , the refresh frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty knots are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such in which no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are part @-@ applications from third side , which can be re @-@ used by any part @-@ enabled application , the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load a component in &quot; read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load . only @-@ read @-@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if the plugin is correct , select it even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should later be installed .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented which allows different implement@@ ations of plug@@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , supporting the use of &amp; gu@@ ed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; In@@ serts .
using the Deb@@ ug@@ ger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger @-@ Plugin drop@@ down box , the specific settings can be changed .
when a de@@ bu@@ gger is activated for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view that displays the contents of monitored variables . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all stops are listed , with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock .
a view shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . normally appears in the bottom dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it divi@@ des the plug @-@ in to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally it is not necessary to pay attention to it .
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session Star@@ ted the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug @-@ request . this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output view .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , execution will be continued . if the script is started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , the execution starts as soon as a request is made .
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include it is properly pur@@ ged .
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there is not the current one .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable .

&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two ways , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the Script languages and / CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag Archives contain two file types , which include text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool boxes . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars allow for fast inser@@ ting of tags into a document without the risk of a writer .
tag Fol@@ ders are not as folders . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag Fol@@ ders carry the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better look and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but element type over itself otherwise nothing .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( family 2 only )
only valid for the Type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( family 2 only )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( family 1 only )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a type element only element .
prints the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source of the data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag group@@ ing the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a only element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each element ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a only element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a only element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declarations start : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces influence nothing , but look at &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialogue at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . an additional dialog will appear , with simple instructions to follow .
this function is currently not currently available . currently , the check is performed only when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ loading feature is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; error &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; option &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for using DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; General &#93; Version = Re@@ verse 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... created . click New Action will result in the same dialog :
this action assigned short@@ cuts . by clicking the user defined button you can assign a short@@ cut ; with K@@ ON the current short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that will change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the Quick Start Di@@ alogue or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be given . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line , like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . On this way try &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variable that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with PID the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be added to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used by the external script .
parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the project file .
in addition to the above methods , a script input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus can be used . in the input field , input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , which should be specified with the text written on the standard output , by setting the value to the output drop :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the pop @-@ up .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it , enable dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available to allow an input when using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ugly symbol . who should remember the action associated with that symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , chart Additional programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually regarded as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least be sign@@ aled a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it must still be associated with the action . this happens via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field there is a button , press it .
select the folder where the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags as there are some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( on the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar can believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by using all the symbols to make sure everything works .
after real@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust its &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that its toolbar ( s ) is loaded ( will be ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most popular extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second we handle here .
# K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in main index Top element = Your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax syntax ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the box depth ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but look at &amp; lt ; notes . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files will be replaced .
the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which serves to shape the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script to display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . there are only two types of entries here : the context List ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of separate context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use .
if you are sure that these are good and worth sharing , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; community . you will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the lost resources ( D@@ TE@@ P pack@@ ets , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places there is an Email menu item , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , send tool bar tool bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the Scrip@@ ts tree .
the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . to contribute to this , we recommend signing the resources to what it requires a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . this ensures the origin of the resources , both for our team as well as for later users .
when up@@ loading , you are asked for your private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New Resource dialog , you will need to fill out the input fields ( URL preview can remain empty ) and start up@@ loading with clicking OK .
the Up@@ load can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D File menu ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , upload tool bar tool bar , and start the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in case of problems it warns and it can then be broken down . in case of problems it warns and it can then be broken down . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a notification appears with the specification of the resource of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert DT@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package .
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D File menu and the conversion of a DT@@ D . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D Description which should be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
doc@@ type Defini@@ tions line : the string that appears in ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; adapted . it is recommended to use this possibility .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand this and to be able to draw full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbar , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user &apos;s directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are available only within a particular project . this can be all from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most constra@@ ined size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the construction views , the tabs with information and the tool bar .
right @-@ click the tabs to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all of the tabs , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jumping to a book@@ mark or exec@@ uting CVS instructions to the current document .
right click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste / paste ) , edit the tags under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional acts as a standard for which a set of tool bars is shown . in the course of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; insert into your document , then click the icon representing the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog box for different fields .
the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable you to navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and ro@@ am . in the display with tabs , files , project , pattern templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation are available .
project management is a powerful tool called &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows the management of files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from storage media can be performed with the context menu displayed .
a further possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . the category depends on &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can access the available information to a script .
with this view , the internal structure of the active document is displayed . by clicking an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an item opens a list of commands regarding navigation and ref@@ res@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can quickly alter attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add project @-@ specific documentation , edit and be viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tabs at the bottom of the window , which can be accessed through the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
this tab shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an E@@ Mail , they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; auto@@ conf has a number of options passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the PAT@@ H in front of your bin folder . the same applies for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to occupy himself with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer restricted to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
now , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; following , in good use of free software , the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation can increase dramatically .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
for more detailed documentation , help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or execute k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ eur Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use . see the section on Tem@@ plates . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder folder , only one error is reported .
converted when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there included special characters for &amp; HTML ; write , so that they are displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ Description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
switches or outputs the block selection . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go straight to a line number . this is very useful when your &amp; PHP ; script outputs error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expression to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of script actions and de@@ bu@@ gger .
start and turn on the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to place book@@ marks with a click of a mouse .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries Pre@@ y or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
upload the files in your project to the server . the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details .
load a project tool bar . these are stored in project you / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . actions only need to specify the name . actions must be saved by setting actions ... Settings . tool bars are stored on tool@@ bars toolbar , or you will be asked when you exit , whether you want to save the toolbar .
removes a tool bar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team in order for the toolbar to be present in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
enables the up@@ loading of tool bars to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in .
invite one &amp; DT@@ D ; who has made you or anyone else and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refresh@@ ed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bars . if the default ( HTML ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activated or de@@ activated the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the insertion is denied by means of a tool bar if that day contradic@@ ts the rules .
in the Plugins menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed under the menu items mentioned above . click on them . click an activated plug @-@ in de@@ activ@@ ates it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of high@@ lighting schemes depends on the type ; version .
sel@@ ects the type of line ending . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
veri@@ fies the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
instant switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in K@@ DE libraries , change@@ over can sometimes need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . when selecting an entry , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated .
switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
changes in this dialog affects any application using the K@@ HTML @-@ part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
displays the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate , you can find details .
a dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar , or add which can be added and the sequences can change .
this should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lo@@ wer@@ case letters and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can specify the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected log will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to include files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
allow if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached . if a project is started from scratch , do not stop .
this option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub @-@ window profile or changed using the Shift ; F@@ 7 key short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this way the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the bottom @-@ window profiles , high loading profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile , by pointing out its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration dialog , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete events . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as saving a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the last project opened , cannot be influenced at present .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project or Project Icon Project open from the toolbar . the dialog Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders will behave as well , but the entries are missing and opening with ... in the context menu available with the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removing the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be da@@ zz@@ led to prevent the removal .
the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by program@@ mers . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather uns@@ af@@ e password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; many high @-@ load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port .
depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a risk . use them at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can &apos;t be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be stored , opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via Settings toolbar Project Tool@@ bar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity , but also allows adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own way of working .
as mentioned above , tool bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best discussed . use and addition differ . the addition of tool bars is treated at the bottom in the addition of tool bars .
the toolbar and the symbols can be set either using the context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which a new toolbar can be created , other actions can be removed such as toolbar , ren@@ ame tool bar or set tool@@ bars to indicate which actions on this or other toolbar are to be displayed .
by calling the context menu to an action toolbar , the entries will be removed and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbar buttons in the Settings menu ... and set Settings ... set .
templates are basically document skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . you can copy , move or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in example the limitations you imagine for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on the template tree is available .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents can be created in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in the appropriate way to be efficient . see in for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents . you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system based on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for entire websites . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summari@@ zed in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As a template Save as local template ....
once this is done , you will notice that ( even if it is saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree .
select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file only to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the tree or project files , you can click on a folder on the right and create site template , enter a name for the template and secure . by default , it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template .
project templates provide a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can make head@@ lines and foot@@ ers , or dynamic with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files laid in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led once el@@ ter@@ ly attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set so it would disable templates in this path , except they would be explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or reproduced text for templates in this folder . this could be common he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy all templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers for a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( show the right mouse button ) via a full command collection to add folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source code editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second one spl@@ its the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code editor if necessary , in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code are visible .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor in a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green symbol shows the default of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; to edit and PHP ; there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works exactly like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor synchron@@ ously . pressing F@@ 9 is enabled , this mode is already active , the key press moves the active cursor from one window to another , while maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is adjustable by settings Qu@@ anta . when selecting V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation : a small range for fast machines and a large range for slow computers .
suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; editor is possible . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to reduce the manual encoding . this allows you to change the following :
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows changing the content , e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword key words 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules using the buttons below the list . a change over the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the cursor is as usual in a word processor , due to moving with arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves as usual . the selection works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of a button or a range key .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way using the toolbar , as in the source code editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously does not remove already existing identical tags , e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded by text , must be removed every other surrounding ar@@ mature day .
some toolbar assistant or Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later on &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists tool@@ bars must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of the style sheet can be followed .
um &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to be able to compile successfully , you need lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present in a typical installation .
support in a template , in one place in a style or x@@ ml file loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , the orph@@ aned retention points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g retri@@ eves the full path from a file name without path input . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . for example loading a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following entry is possible :
this command will check for a partial or entire match with a template named QNAP or a specified model name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP that contains the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the given &quot; QNAP &quot; will be extended to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file , x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stopping point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is automatically executed when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . re@@ taining points will be re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

if a value is specified for the &quot; search@@ result set &quot; option , all output files are stored in this folder . otherwise , the folder of the style template will be used . by default , search@@ result .x@@ ml will be edited by search@@ .x@@ s@@ l , with the option &quot; pre@@ fre@@ e.@@ &quot; search@@ .@@ ht@@ m@@ l@@ .x@@ s@@ l is used .
if the command &quot; search &quot; is executed , a x@@ ml file named search@@ result .x@@ ml will be created . this file can then be edited with a custom style sheet to show the data in another form , if the prefer@@ red@@ .@@ txt option is not set , the file search@@ resul@@ t.@@ txt is displayed .

&quot; &quot; &quot; start a shell . then type the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; help &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; command to get an overview of the help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
inserts the parameter with the name &amp; lt ; NA@@ ME@@ TER ; and the value &amp; lt ; V@@ AL@@ U@@ E@@ TE ; add to the X@@ SL environment variables . see also the documentation on the command &quot; add@@ par@@ am &quot;
exec@@ utes the conversion 20 times if --@@ repeat is double , the conversion is 100 times executed
the input documents are treated as HTML files when the support for it has been activated in lib@@ x@@ ml
activ@@ ates the X@@ Inclu@@ de processing of the input document when the support for this is enabled in lib@@ x@@ ml . this is turned on as default
on systems with an installed re@@ ad@@ line library , you can scroll through the cursor keys to / from the previous commands .
multiple commands require more than one argument . quotes can be used to pass compound expressions as an argument . &amp; eg ; : with the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as argument a holding point is set in a file named &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template consisting only of the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name like &quot; x@@ s@@ l : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;
fil@@ en@@ ame : a valid local fil@@ en@@ ame on the user &apos;s system . on Unix or Cy@@ g@@ win systems , the name may have the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; as a short form for the personal folder .
path : a path to change the folder . on some operating systems the pre@@ fix &quot; ~ &quot; is replaced by the path to your personal folder .
data : the XML data or the XML document that is processed by the style template . see also &amp; lt ; FI@@ LE@@ NA@@ ME@@ TER ; and &amp; lt ; UR@@ I@@ ts ;
run@@ time commands : { bye _ BA@@ R _ exit _ BA@@ R _ quit } , step , Step@@ Up , Step@@ down , next , continue , run , trace , set@@ option , options
there are many graphical tools to compare . why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts when merging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the merge and merge of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result expected . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for folder merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s colour monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is the same , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder
the opening dialog enables manual typing of file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog will remember your selection and displays it again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files will be performed .
via the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the merge or merge of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the other two folders .
if merging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later when saving .
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start the merge / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the open dialog , you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you &apos;d first need to create two corresponding files , load them into &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , paste , and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at this time you can do nothing &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse over the line for a while . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu . )
if a difference is detected , the color indicates which file is different . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . that is in the next section ( merging ) well to see .
if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . )
the vertical line dividing the abstra@@ ction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line is rendered to dotted lines .
the result window ( among the reference windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ alters &#93; if you have edited the result . usually , it contains text by automatically merging text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge button to find next solved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts ) .
if only two comparison bars are used , any difference at the same time is also a conflict that has to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows , where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black beam .
sometimes , through automatic merging or manual editing , no more line is left in the group ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; no line in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder for the case that you may change your mind and maybe again select another source . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a selection you might copy and insert somewhere else .
the text &amp; lt ; conflicts of merge ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function .
note : if selecting the sources ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
navigate mainly with scroll bars and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and string end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs .
in the display window , you can also use the other buttons for editing . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insertion and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation which allows you to skip to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ above ) to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ click Move / C@@ trl @-@ Image Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the poin@@ ter to the clip@@ board , you must copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ paste ) . there is also the option option automatically copy . if this is checked , whatever you mark , is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and the manual copying is om@@ itted . be careful with this option , because you may accidentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors are using a new@@ line \ \ r \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart re@@ circulation + new@@ line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the game and restored at the next start . ( menu Sett@@ ing@@ s- &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you enable this option , differences will be displayed in itali@@ c script . if the font selected does not support this representation , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered straight . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
when this option is checked , pressing the tab key will insert the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise a tab character will be inserted .
when you press enter or return , the ind@@ entation of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line .
when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copying the manual to the clip@@ board is om@@ itted then .
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files , try &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all the completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . in this step white characters are not ignored . even when merging white marks are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart track \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ spr@@ int &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others save only a new@@ spr@@ int &apos; \ &apos; , but then files with different sizes may look identical in the page @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but if this option is enabled , this option must be disabled .
in default , this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
by default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely search for even smaller differences . the option is activated by default . it is effective in complex and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
this is useful when white characters are less important in many files . if you need this only from time to time , then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on how to scan folders and execute a merge . look for details under Docum@@ entation to compare and merge .
if a file is saved and already an older version exists , the original version is app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it is deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and re@@ boot for the change to be active . ( this option is in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
the code for encoding results in a short notice of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your code@@ c . ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
switch this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white characters in text or overview columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color coded transitions column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection of A &amp; lt ; &amp; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ see column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply fill out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . the current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . you can use this function e.g. for cutting out annoying parts or for correc@@ ting the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is used for the input of this command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program this themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this command for line synchronization to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s \ \ \ ( \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert character strings generated ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword produced text $ . you can change the list as needed . \ \ before $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in feature in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line matching . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every Sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , thus quasi @-@ deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead of sed you can use something else , e.g. per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / ZIP . however , per@@ l needs only a few details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) needs , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor are maintained for display and merging . further operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre @-@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers have to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate the merging and displays the simulated changes without real@@ ising it .
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as a base . if no destination folder is specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merging . to start the merging , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow . )
while reading the folders , a small message window will inform you of the current progress . if you cancel the scanning of the folders , only the files that have been compared up to that date will be listed .
when scanning the folders is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
you can open a folder by clicking on the + / - , or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions spo@@ ilers and all sub@@ directories where you can open or fold up all folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears .
the symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the A / B / C column and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merging is started , you will be informed about problems of this kind again .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . in folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copying B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such faulty objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the Synchron@@ ization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified , and if the option synchron@@ izes directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging ( uns@@ af@@ e ) is enabled , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange such errors are not eliminated , merging the folders cannot be started .
during merging , one file is processed after the other . you state @-@ column displays completed if the merge was successful , and according to other messages when something unexpected happened . if merging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
when in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display other columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only indicated when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( File or O@@ dner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merging actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging .
please note : if you don &apos;t have a destination folder , then C is used as destination in the three @-@ folder merging mode . B is selected as the target when merging two @-@ folder merging , and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as destination .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . in order to merge only the current entry , select Run the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid merging actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
if you merge all entries , a dialog box will appear with options , simulate and cancel .
choose Sim@@ ulations if you want to see what would happen without the actual changes made . you will then receive a complete list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window will open ( note the screen@@ shot of the screen ) .
if you are finished with a file , select start / continue the directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved it , a corresponding dialog will appear . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work will continue with the next entry .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to make a mistake , a message and detailed status information appears . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . so you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging .
if some entries have been merged individually , note &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not merge them together again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered finished . only when you change the merge operation , these entries will be merged .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( setup menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merging with these options :
only files matching the given pattern will be displayed in the element tree . you can enter several patterns . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders do not have to match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as a separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder can be specifically configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a preceding point marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the Ele@@ mental Tree or not . this option is enabled by default .
for links to files : when the option is turned off , symbolic links will be compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated by default .
when the option is turned on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not responding to possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of resolved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that contain no text . ( specify a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it may be quicker to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to confidentiality the modification date . there is no real comparison . the files will be considered identical if they are equal . this may , for example , be useful when copying the modified date . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
activ@@ ates Synchron@@ ization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified . in this mode , the merge suggestions are selected to be identical to both folders . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default .
if there are differences , instead of merging it is suggested to copy the newer file as an action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in the default setting .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version is renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , this will also affect the normal merging of individual files , not just merging entire folders . this option is enabled by default .
normally the folder merge view will remain visible during merging individual files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the folder &amp; text window in the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by alternating between the directory and the text window .
you probably prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . to do so , the status will be returned to completion and the file will not be merged even if you start the folder merge .
this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory again : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening , located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with one on an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . you should note a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , whit@@ esp@@ ace &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or you can &apos;t tell if a link to a file or folder shows . then a file is always accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ates from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch will start to restore the missing file .
in Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . the merging or comparing of folders is not supported in the part mode .
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now hot comp@@ actors ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this path or going to do it like that .
you compiled the program from sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default configure installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines will be treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line will not be treated as identical .
the editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C . this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . in order to edit large amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , suddenly lt ; No sr@@ c has been set ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can that be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , if difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mailing lists of it .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) copy to the clip@@ board and delete the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position or replaces the current mark .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder doesn &apos;t already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the let@@ tering A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the rows from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) .
in default , this option is disabled . under@@ scores in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a mini preview of all virtual desktop spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ space , change their size , finish them or move them . this works in both a desktop and several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ spaces as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button you can move windows inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working areas .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager to set up ... and exit . if , however , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas .
when this field is checked , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops is displayed in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is inter@@ sec@@ ted with name , the names are provided with atomic numbers , eg ; 1st desktop .
when this box is checked , the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displayed .
when this box is checked , the current programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty work@@ spaces are displayed to enable them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply displays simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon displays the windows with its default icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , all virtual work@@ spaces appear in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical line , which is very well suited for display side@@ ways on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , which can display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar .
right @-@ click within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set up sel@@ ector switch ... lets the dialog box appear .
at the moment this can not be changed in the Settings dialog . you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ .@@ If you do not have a write permission for the file , you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key win@@ dow@@ banner mode and assign it to this value . possible values are :

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; k@@ mag ; to enlarge a part of the screen so as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation is intended to be a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag .
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high performance computers .
if you want to start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of the screen shows the magni@@ fied area of the screen . in the following , this window is called a magni@@ fication window . the picture shown in the magni@@ fication window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window below .
in the default setting , &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively you can &amp; k@@ mag ; to do this , set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fier window ( select window ) or the environment of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse poin@@ ter . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter .
in the drop @-@ down mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fier window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fier window . this also works with the arrow keys .
in addition , press the &amp; Shift key or press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window stays fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&amp; k@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
starts or stops the updating of the display . stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , magni@@ fiers and size &amp; etc ; .
k@@ mag is also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use a screen magni@@ fier , so as if you are using a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artists to web designers or visually han@@ dicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter remains in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and cause pain to every mouse click .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; em@@ ulate a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter remains in the same place for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can b@@ ypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this is not done yet .
to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by mouse click , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break the motion briefly .
if the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button . the smart move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if Smart For@@ ward is turned on , the turn@@ table setting time ( 1 / 10 s ) becomes active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is waiting , before releasing the mouse button , before releasing the mouse button again , if no moving of the mouse occurs .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click by mouse shift . if this function activ@@ ates , a slow moving to the right and back leads to a double click . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these moves are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time it is started , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can move &amp; k@@ de ; move to the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and click here the tab General . there &apos;s a sli@@ der sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at every start of &amp; k@@ de ; this function is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there .
reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog . if you have already pressed the user button , the settings will be reset to the status after the last press hit .
the best thing is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the smart move should be turned off . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later accept the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in sounds .
first of all , you should be aware of where a mou@@ sec@@ lick remains without effect : clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link will not result in unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first of all you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rollers . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scratch with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using the smart move , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to a different location .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it . but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input . thus , a acci@@ dently moving mouse cursor can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit lyrics .
the smart move is an advanced feature of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very probably possible to copy text , copy it into the clip@@ board , or run any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . however , it will probably only cause problems . here are some advice :
do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this will each time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button hits a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when shifting the sliding time . later , you can also use the smart move without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . but that requires some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test Expansion for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should already be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers , and these are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is short . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and causing pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that allows silent users to speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences which are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command , which will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details , see the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the standard text passages . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can reconci@@ le the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words are included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a memory of the already spoken pro@@ positions ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
you can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is app@@ ended to the memory memory . you can select phrases that are to be spoken again .
with the Settings k@@ mouth menu entry , set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page .
in the input field of the language edition , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding and the text will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text is to be passed on to the voice generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text is passed on as a parameter . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
of course , the command for voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this are provided in the app@@ endi@@ x .
this option is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; applications provide a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first drop @-@ down menu action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or the choice of a text passage in the menu item text@@ book or the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage will be added directly to the input field by selecting In the input field . the selected text passage is only entered in the input field with the selection of In the input field .
with the second drop @-@ down box closing the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text passage book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text passages , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text passage book will not be saved . select Before Sen@@ ding , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passage book should be stored .
the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the drop @-@ down box .
select the desired language for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , in order to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries will be merged and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; add new entries automatically to the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passage book , you can only change its name .
you can either add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting from the menu bar , toolbar , or via a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the memory storage .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the memory storage .
the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the memory memory .
if this menu entry is checked , a sliding toolbar with buttons for commonly used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is inter@@ sec@@ ted , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is inter@@ sec@@ ted , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is located directly under the tool bar via the editing pane . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another location .
you probably have not entered the command for the voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator written in &amp; Java . currently it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge without further restrictions .
to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in / usr / local / fre@@ eware . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following command samples :
for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ e@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows down the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 / de@@ 1 - / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v

the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since setting the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you just have to use the possibility of using kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice command in &amp; k@@ mouth .
for setting , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; you need a voice generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with which people who cannot speak can let text output through the computer . it stores a list of already spoken pro@@ positions which the user can always re@@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth does not include any voice syn@@ thesizer . a voice syn@@ thesizer must be installed on the computer .

before you can use it , you need to install and set speech speech to speech . see also
on the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card card holder will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card General will be displayed .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female ones , or those that differ in volume or speed . they can also set up multiple variants for a syn@@ thesizer . they should at least set up a speaker before you use &amp; kt@@ ats ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ chers are used by the default speakers .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer can be compared to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
if you click on the tab &quot; Spe@@ aker in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , &quot; the card holder will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers already installed appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear in the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output if there is no interpreter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a click of the mouse , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a click of the mouse and click on this button to push the speaker down one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; system .
choose a type of mood here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the card board speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; already almost use . go back to the map General and check if voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to start the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ats ; click on the card board to create and manage text jobs .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start the language distribution system by &amp; k@@ de ; click on the tab @-@ tab General to open this tab . here you can set some general options .
tick this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ats ; this will start the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed , and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled .
if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , it runs &amp; kt@@ ats ; further , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr automatically appears in the Control Panel &apos;s system area while reading it , it disappears once the reading is finished .
with buttons in this series , you can start , cancel , pause , and resume text jobs .
with buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for an order .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all pages .
the debit card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the tab @-@ tab General and tick the language edition there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ats ; runs . then select the text to read before , and select text in the main menu . after a short time , the speech output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ ressing lines and other invisible brands are also read before .
in &amp; kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de , you can read the displayed text . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ats ; runs . then select the text to read before and select the Text text in the main menu . then the speech output should start .
this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; News &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which informs you about events you have set up . you can also read and read the text of this news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de , you can set up various types of messages . you can set up &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; for example , set up a message appearing in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ats ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for C@@ Noti@@ fy vary depending on the application .
the file k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the scope of delivery by &amp; kt@@ ats ; is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , as it can be assumed as a premis@@ e in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced features of &amp; kt@@ ats ; . for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ats ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech speech tool . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain defici@@ encies of speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the speech tool &quot; speech speech &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ats ; distinguishes four types of text .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other jobs and keeps these orders . when the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important messages such as eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will resume after the output of the warning .
messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you leave &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can begin with &amp; k@@ mouth ; messages are also news .
the rest are simple text jobs . every order you use from the debit card is a text assignment . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text jobs . text jobs are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es , except the output of screen readers . when an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ats ; just reading such , this output will pause and stop .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there are still further types of filters available .
string sub@@ stitutes replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ats ; is provided with pre@@ defined string creation filters that allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format to another format . included in the scope of supply ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speech selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text , or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ats . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , the text will remain unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; message is sent , it is processed by all activated filters created on the bottom of the page . processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed in series from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs will be shown below .
you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for the setup of string enforcement filters . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged for the related sub@@ stitution text .
enter a name for your filter . you can select this name as you like , it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks for the text assignment one of the languages registered here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl ; key pressed .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID running programs get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter cop@@ ete .
the string release filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filters when matching . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
in comparison to words , the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited by del@@ im@@ iters ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to assemble these terms .
XML ; Trans@@ former Trans@@ former &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is available through the environment variable PAT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is sufficient .
the speech selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the card board speaker or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ats ; if a text is passed to the filter , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ats , and the characteristics of the speakers set up on the card board are selected .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the specified regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want to use . if the text fulfil@@ s the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to match the required requirements . click the button on the right to see the dialogue of speakers .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speech selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; , with the program@@ mers can give their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ats ; this syn@@ thesizer can be used .
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; see the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object node .
here is the text of the text to read and write a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands enter
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . first start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Con@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival pages , web pages are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does work at all . you must do this yourself if you do not use this voice for reading websites . make sure the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing grass is output . what can I do against it ?
first of all , make sure the encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may possibly be corrected by a string release filter .

the language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ats have their own license you can find in the related documentation or on the respective websites . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package kt@@ ts@@ d . you can also find the source code of k@@ dump under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .

K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer which can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above may be incomplete or out@@ dated . therefore , drag the description of the syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to the supported languages . look also on the website of kt@@ ats ; , for information that is not yet included in this manual .
the speech tool &quot; speech speech &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to compile , you need a current development environment in K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the speech &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech speech pat@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you get the source code from &amp; kt@@ ats ; from the source code archive for c@@ un@@ plug@@ ins , or have downloaded the tar@@ ball each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use your speech syn@@ thesizer , first check if you are using speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ats ; which uses the speech speech tool . the kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr utility should be developed in such a way that it is possible to set up speech by speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is divided into individual sentences . the user can leave set or paragraph style , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ats , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for output . for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender female , it is used , otherwise the best suitable speaker will be chosen automatically . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ats ; a speaker , you will see in .
if you click Add Sub@@ scribe to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the tab card holder device will be shown below . for example , the setup of the module for festival Interactive will be shown below . you will find details on the modules below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter the festival .
select the text encoding for text that is passed to the Festival . if you are aware of votes that are &amp; kt@@ ats , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slov@@ ak@@ ian use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
these sliding controls allow you to adjust the volume , speech speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controls and display this grey , the selected voice will not let you select these settings .
some voices like multi@@ sy@@ n voices need several seconds to load due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are loaded already at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so that ( with larger memory usage ) the first set is syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to click Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will appear on the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click the icon in the system section to view the program window .
if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running yet , it will appear in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the preview .
here are all jobs listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the precisely edited set . the speaker id corresponds to the column ID on the card holder spokes@@ man .
with the buttons in this series you can proceed or go back or forth in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK all changes of the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click the audio map audio . see also .
here only text jobs are listed and managed . output of screen readers , warnings and messages will not be displayed . for more information on the message types of &amp; kt@@ ats , please see .
select here the type of audio output . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ats ; either compiled without support for the corresponding audio module or &amp; kt@@ ats ; cannot load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ 1 ; % corresponds to approximately half the normal speech rate . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ats ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text assignment is interrupted by a message with higher priority .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other jobs and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen reader is read , the retained orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important messages such as eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text .
messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you leave &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room .
if a text message is interrupted by a message , warning , or output of a screen reader , inserts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queue .
this audio file is always played when a normal text assignment is interrupted . if both the introduc@@ tory sound and the introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . there are no special promotions for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers if they are interrupted by a higher priority message .
to read with &amp; kt@@ ats ; to read K@@ noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts .
tick this check box to enable reading &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ats ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played are deleted by &amp; kt@@ ats ; not read before .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone in an IR@@ C message men@@ tions your nick@@ name .
all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ats ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ats ; do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following wild@@ cards :
you can enter the characteristics of the desired speaker here . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the card board speaker . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action is executed for all other events of the specific application .
the event All Noti@@ fications for Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the noti@@ fications to be sent as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications to a file . use the Save button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events are merged with the events listed in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all items except All Noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard .
currently supports &amp; kt@@ ats ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British Male ) since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog do not set 100 % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and set level detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds divide text into individual sentences . this means that only the first set needs to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , not the whole text order .
here you see the set level detection filters . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ats ; a set limit detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further by@@ laws filter filters , but beginners will be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to select the speaker is to select the speaker &apos;s selection . turn on the language selection and enter text to read . switch on the box menu assignments , which speaker &amp; kt@@ ats ; select some properties and check how the speaker is selected , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ats ; then faster to start reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block of text , which can take a long time ,
you can then pause or cancel text assignments on the card board , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set Level detection filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ul@@ ator sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers .

I invited an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ve / vocals added the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch together with the URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developers .
in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the PAT@@ H environment variable . some syn@@ thesizer modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card board for microphone setup . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active .
the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ats ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ fers .

Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ats .
you must install at least one language . help is found in the instructions supplied with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
you need to compile an additional module for these voices , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to type for the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , look for the festival as the first one on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA and Syn@@ thesizer . then festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; resulting from it the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full language distribution system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this Di@@ phone . Festival generates this from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phone from German texts .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code is added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice synthesis voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files will not be installed in &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folders are installed , but in the / li@@ b / . manuals you will find under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allowing management of network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ s.@@ -@@ package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ create a simple interface for the user to perform the following tasks :
after the installation , a new module network settings are displayed at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; started .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ the device at all displays and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed to install and install Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module will be loaded when the network settings option is selected at the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; when the module network settings are started , this will automatically detect the system used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection will be offered . it is the platform from the list that best fits the distribution and the Rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by selecting the setting No @-@ Again the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , then this selection will be pres@@ et automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode . previously , all options are gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you get system management mode at the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password .
in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tabs :
the tab interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed from the tab network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the dialog box .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options .
in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start , so you can choose either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP according to the system .
by selecting Man@@ ually , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field IP address . the net@@ mask must be specified in the net@@ mask input field .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the network , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in case of doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . switching on a switched off network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned off as required . disable an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking the interface ....
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located .
a computer with DNS support replaces a full domain addition by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer requ@@ esting ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the calcul@@ ator for name resolution Part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS entries can be re@@ arranged by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the buttons down or down in priority .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . then the entry will be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button ....
the name known calcul@@ ator describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when there are no DNS servers available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally the list of names known by name contains some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4 .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit .... Edit Calcul@@ ator dialog will be displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then click OK to update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be dep@@ rec@@ ated .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is sufficient if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a package ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool can be used with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution .
for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are required with libraries and others .
this is recommended by experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile the following commands .
in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology will be given , and in the second section all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ configur@@ able configuration files will be discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is given .
currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found widespread dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future .
one of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface . in external networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace is the network administrator to use a valid IP address or if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , so any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are usually used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is needed for the IP forwarding .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circuit .
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections , so it is not surprising if in the case of active DSL connections , there is another content to be found there .
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . a different stand as expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also offered the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective packing . the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take to secure ?
before a tape can be used , it must be taken from &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways :
&amp; k@@ dat ; return the tape and read the pre@@ st@@ ressing information of the tape . recognize &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t know the credits on the tape , you &apos;ll be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted .
recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre@@ text , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by folding the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; there is a change in the symbol for the band to see the connection for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be ej@@ ected without any danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; format@@ ted .
a band type needs to be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires that a tape needs to be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you can format it from &amp; k@@ dat . flo@@ ppy disk drives usually require format@@ ting of the tape , but DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the tape name and the capacity , the tape continues ; with the format of the tape , all data on the tape is lost ! after the format@@ ting process is finished , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be saved . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup is started , the dialog box opens . in this dialog , you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings .
when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including data rate and time remaining .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu item Veri@@ fication ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog box will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for the review .
if you confirm the verification settings , the dialog appears to check . this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
before you can initiate the restore , the files that need to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the Settings dialog will appear . in this dialog , you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery .
when you confirm the recovery settings , the Rest@@ ore dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the band index file with the content of the tape . this process er@@ ases all existing index files for this volume . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can specify the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is updated automatically according to the currently selected work folder .
for all folders listed in backup files , only the files in the same file system will be backed up as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be added separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others .
perform incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then are backed up .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
&amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ; &amp; gt ;
you can set the settings on the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can do the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding device of the tape device .
this setting is active , transm@@ its &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is mounted , the command will be loaded to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading and writing operations can be performed .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; to lock the throw from the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives .
if the option is turned on , when releasing the &amp; k@@ dat file , the tape will automatically be ki@@ cked off . do not use this option for flo@@ ppy drives .
if the option is turned on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band id will be used to find a file named in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file folder .
the rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified presentation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system leaves the various protocol files .
moreover , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access , for example , to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and will be explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shots , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after the start , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open . will not show you this , and instead it opens a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very likely not with system administrator rights . the protocol files are usually found in / var / log , for normal users usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or entered string . add a string to the filter bar . the list of the log lines will be changed automatically , so that only the log lines that match the selected filter will be displayed . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term will then only be compared with the entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the name of a process , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . tran@@ script lines of level errors are indicated with a more eye @-@ catching color as minutes lines of the level indication . the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled setup dialog .
if you only want to display a specific process ( e.g. in the system log or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can show the process identification ( PID ) in the trial column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar .
in addition , you can enable the Add to New Lines option in the Main Window &apos;s context menu to display all the new lines that are added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website at ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. There you will find more current information on the sources of reference &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find the following folder in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the System V In@@ it is fast becoming the standard for controlling program start when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re @-@ format@@ ting . the &amp; Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc This folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for each system service you want to start when you run the system or when you switch to another run level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial that is started only once . such calls include r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port .
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up something , then you can fix it by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line like this :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script is inv@@ oked with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; run a server run level that only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; running . in addition , I could also have a user -@@ Run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc ; starts .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start ( or stop ) at this level .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ stit@@ n or change the position within a level by moving somewhere else . this will only happen when you remove an entry from the range of available system services .
note : entries are moved if you drag them into a new section . to simply copy them to a new Run@@ level , you need to explicitly select from the Edit menu item or from the context menu and paste it to the target area -- even if the same entry has been in the target area of the action .
the Sor@@ ting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case you need to edit the Sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again .
note : at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the tab key to activate the various work@@ spaces ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or bottom of the previous .
to move an entry to another Run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of loss of data , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available .
I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ stit@@ n and now the machine is constantly re@@ working . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be in order ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; run under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you are using Su@@ SE or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not conform to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check if all configuration files are present ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as eg ; Apache and ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or mis@@ configured .
the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ all level varies from distribution to distribution , may even be different from version to version . if you are using any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to begin , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you must save it . either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save in the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two flash@@ cards , the user name and the user group list . to edit select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry .
some flash@@ cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you have enabled space constraints ( quot@@ a ) for users , a flash@@ card will be created where you can make individual adjustments .
the password management card appears in case shadow passwords , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Unix , are installed .
this card will only appear if for at least one fil@@ esystem space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( identi@@ fiable to the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field fil@@ esystem with limited space limitation
the flash@@ card groups inform about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Pri@@ mary group field . furthermore , the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works similarly .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , remove , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more .
