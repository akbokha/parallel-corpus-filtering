<seg id="1">The module website can be found in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras site. select from the drop-down list the source and target language of the translation.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated at the location of the entire page.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is only very rudimentary. Babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make any important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated at the Babelfish-page itself, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror; by readily available.</seg>
<seg id="6">More information about using & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual at & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror; to load, choose settings extensions... Open the card card tools and select the desired modules there.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings modules from the kde; addons. please note that there may be more modules on your system if you have installed additional software.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page that has & konqueror; crash, or delete the list of crashes, if present.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module Angle filter (also called the folder filter) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Extras view filter. with the module you can filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in the & konqueror, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed website. as default the display starts with the root node of the document, for example: documentElement, all other nodes are subelements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory for local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different toolbar and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The feature of & FSView; is to graphically represent nested folder hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView; the size of a folder is the size of a file or folder, and the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily identified, even if they are located far down in the folder hierarchy. consequently, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView; is an entry in the Treemap representation a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. to facilitate navigation, the rectangles have meaningful colour and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can represent either depth for easy detection of nesting depth or representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labelled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is available at all, only if there is enough space for representation or if the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used (and therefore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle).</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemaps rendering algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView; frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and this framework will need space which will not be available to the subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How splitting the area of an entry is carried out for the subordinate entries remains up to the implementation. here it is always advantageous for the labeling and avoiding of space losses through frames so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods concerning this are lines, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum displayed area for an entry over the menu entry View Angle over area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widgets designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">You can find the picture gallery in the & konqueror; -menu under Extras Gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Picture Gallery, a dialog opens, allowing you to specify the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The images per line option has a slider and a turning field to set the number of thumbnails in each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">Check the filename of the image to see if the file names are shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="32">You can use the check box to include subfolders with a slider or a turning field to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Use the check box to copy the original images to see if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the check box comment section, you can specify a comment file for the caption of the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own colour depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails as in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; settings gives you easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML settings. the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the & konqueror; menu under window navigation area or with the shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation area of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition adds a menu entry in & konqueror; with which you can change browser and operating system identifier for individual domains. this is useful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a website that refuses to access this browser, change the browser ID to one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the password in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need MSIE browser recognition to use the & konqueror; call Hotmail.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug; working together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& edited; includes fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, review and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can easily be extended with KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & edited; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support raw conversion by libraw, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, as & eg; via the camera or lens to search for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde, programs is also & digikam, an open source project. that means it is dependent on the support of the end users. therefore, they should report problems and improvement opportunities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& edited; tries to make the reporting of problems or suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, your web browser will open a page in the bug reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the bug reporting system.</seg>
<seg id="61">& edited; is a project that is supported by a community. that is, the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we want to encourage you to answer questions to other users of & edited; however, in this mailing list English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digiplug; homepage to visit news about released versions and other information about & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digiplug; to participate, registration is available in the developer mailing list. instructions to login in the developer mailing list from & digiplug;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & Edit; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data will be saved. this path will remain the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digiplug; will use additionally as an Albenlibrary. settings digiKam setting up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as a base folder. & edited; viewed every subfolder as an album. no picture will be changed. while browsing the folders you will get a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& edited; Durlooks recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude subfolders, unless it's iste in hidden folders. this allows you to execute exceptionally and digitize; execute a point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My AlbenList do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can in & digiplug; set up your digital camera. after that, you should learn how to use My Albums and My keyword list to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw File Support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, you may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported video cameras in the help of raw camera support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set this up and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly into & digiplug; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the gphoto2 library. of course, each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug; working together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a disk drive. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">Photo2 is a free, distributable software collection for digital cameras supporting an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transmission of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digiplug; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gPhoto2 through. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the preview images from digiKam. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you may not be able to see thumbnail images or the creation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the nicest things to come & see is how easy it is to extend its functionality through modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIP plugins: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digiplug;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide the modules for all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & edited; by writing a small module to complete a function when the changes in & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode using F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albentree, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only limitation is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, data list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. this way, the filter will only work on the file name if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields can be displayed can be configured in the Albendings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos created by & edited are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were recorded on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created, the date can be changed in the properties of the album.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select an album Importing images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the then appearing menu, you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, right click on the album and edit the album features in the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- collections: are a method to select your albums to be grouped under a common name. the collection you have placed is used to sort your photos by selecting from the toolbar or sort by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The Eldest, Average, New Year buttons: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest image or that of the album's average. to do this, first try to calculate the average of images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first open an album in & digiplug; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as Album icon, click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; Add as Album View. additionally you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& edited; supports entering keywords for individual photos in the field My keyword list on the bottom left in the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window gives you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album the first time, you need to wait a little while the thumbnails are generated. you can avoid this by using the Tools menu to recreate all thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information about each image is displayed below the associated preview. what information this is, you can edit about Settings digikam. set up the albums page and adjust the area preview pictures to your liking.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you let the mouse pointer rest for a moment above a picture. the help shows the most important properties including all keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the section introduction to the main window shows such help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in a way that fits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can choose all the features that come with & edited; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or the editing of the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open image editing using a photo by selecting either F4 Image Edit... or selecting the right mouse button of the image. in the digiplug section, you will find a guide how to edit your photos. with the image editing you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digiplug; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub-menu of opening. for this, and how to customize it to your needs, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after editing by other image editing programs, there may be problems with the metadata contained in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF data and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& edited; provides two options to rotate. the easiest way is to click the thumbnail to preview and rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & Edit, it will be moved into the garbage bins of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Delete If you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslisteem; organizes your photos by means of the data. & digiplug; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of the last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown.</seg>
<seg id="109">Tags are a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalogue your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned individual photos or whole groups. as soon as a keyword has been assigned a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Tags can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your tags logically. you can also fold parts of the tree & quot; My keyword lipips; so that you can find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the tags are re-imported when the database is lost; the pictures notice.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either & quot; My keyword; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you add a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will become the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it there. then a menu appears that gives you the opportunity to postpone the keyword. a keyword can be only once in a tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keyword;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, select the image with the right mouse button and select as a Album View in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the Album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To take advantage of the functionality with keywords, you must first add your photos. this can be done in two ways: once you select the photos you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword; drag and drop it there. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the images and select from the context menu keyword.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can have a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be shown once you choose one of the keywords allocated to it. in this way, you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place on which the photo was taken, one for the event with which it was made etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be shown in the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the menu item menu. the menu only displays the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view displays a time-based adjustable histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved using this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection frame that displays the time unit. this displays all the corresponding images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection. it will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Include all database elements: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more.</seg>
<seg id="125">In addition, the search box is a small lamp that will be green when the search hits. if you click here the filtering will be deleted and all pictures will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with the binoculars. if you open this you will save a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press OK and the search will be done. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your selection after the search again, you only need to select the corresponding entry in my search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the form to enter the search appears again with the previously entered search information. if you choose to edit as advanced search, the dialog for advanced search appears to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Search in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search provides you with an advanced search form with many search parameters, which you can search in certain fields of & digiplug; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albendatabase. all rules will be added to this list by operators separately. any option can be added to this list with search group / search group deleted or deleted from it. in addition, you can create search of type & quot; AND NICHTquot; & quot; & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digikam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they match. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar. by using a threshold, the result selection can be enlarged or reduced. if you slide a picture from somewhere above the icon of the inaccurate search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hand-hand drawing sketch: draw a quick sketch and digiplug; find the matching pics. also here you can set a threshold value.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or zoom out or hold it and move it. move it while holding the left mouse button. all pictures within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. it will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geofolder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digiplug; provides a luminous table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the luminaire and its window is opened.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview window, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare to the left or right part of the window. a small arrow will show you which copy in which window area is to be seen. if you choose preview from the toolbar and carry out a zoo or move operations on one of the images, you can then compare the same area of the two images.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a picture series. if you use pair-wise navigate from the toolbar, then the two first pictures are automatically loaded into the areas for comparison. now use the left mouse button on any preview screen to view it in the right pane. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All picture information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed arrows. to wave the visible area of the image, you need to click it and hold the & LMB. in the preview mode, both images will display the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zooming works as well as in other views. just use the zoom knob under the images or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out. this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital inventory management - aside from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers each part of the process followed after the image was taken up to the final output and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management. most of us do this, however, not in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos again. we concentrate on the procedures for digital photographers the & digikam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, extracting, storing, archiving, optimising, waiting and export of image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital inventory management refers to, indexed, categorized, secures, searches, transformed, confectioned and exported contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is, according to your definition, data that provides information about or a documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">If you don't even know how many photos you have, then use it not & digiplug;. the approach to save the metadata both in a database and in the image files guarantees very quick searches and a secure archiving on which you can freely access other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you engage something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide if you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc; note that you will have to change to a larger drive someday.</seg>
<seg id="151">You might be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be quickly found about your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos then you will use subfolders as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc; export. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have other requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new files from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend the option to save Metadata in the Settings page of the metadata in & digiplug; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album View menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change it? add & digiplug; you have a metadata editor available for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign stitch words, labeling and evaluation to each photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value.</seg>
<seg id="158">Now let's use keywords, keywords, as you frequently refer to other programs, or continue categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digiplug; automatically insert the tree for you or place the images in the correct place. reassuring the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can be easily done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digiplug; updated as it tracks the subtree.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata is intersected. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata consists of many sections. filenames and calendar data refer to properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most people don't want to let anyone see your photos, you want to share them with your friends, family, photographers and agencies. you're sure to be interested in how your photos will arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance it is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachou; in French Normandie 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream of associations, memories, the historical time span is again present, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who view your photos, the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer, to help him about the subject you moved has to understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lettering for itself.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as an inscription. you can even export it for a selection of pictures. if you export your pictures to web galleries, then these labels are exported to your wishes in the lettering and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of Google Earth? good, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now runs with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips by means of images with geographic information.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice to use copyrights to remove limitations concerning the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the direction page of & digiplug; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should include your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, for example to protect the identity of the photographer, the name of a company or organization may not be changed. this field does not support commas nor semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title: linked to the author. this field contains the photographer's job description. examples can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a note of the author field, this must be filled in as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who works the photo. if the photographer works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you offer the picture to others. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group / agency that offers the picture here is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright-sections, even though they do not offer protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify those embedded in the image. for private individuals, this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digiplug; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, power breaches, ECC, transmission errors, ageing of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, spread superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you can find problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which cause data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, you have to be cautious and you can't trust longer than a couple of years. of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold-coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for yourself.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good shooting devices and store them in the correct way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just written them. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect themselves. despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there's a convenient program called IsoBuster which apparently works wonders in CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but it is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged disks, hard disks, flash drives, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray Disks seem to capture the format war against HD DVD. a Dual-layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual-layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said about CDs and DVDs is of course also true for the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Write the media with a description, date & author and store it on a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives: floppies study</seg>
<seg id="187">Electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART is the most common error reason, SMART is the most common error reason. SMART errors are the most common cause of failure. this is especially reading errors and displacement counters. the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you have secured the files, but these losses can usually be recovered without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices do not make much noise, the devices with computer chips and high-speed processors look different. these can cause serious damage. thus, these anomalies can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboard and other defects. protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounded the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector strip. remember, however, that not every connector also contains an overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should ensure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should ensure that even all peripherals connected to your system are protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage contactors that also include a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are especially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and you also have the protection for the modem. this makes it ideal for traveling.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in a non-interruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system ordered down. if you purchase a UPS then you should be sure that it meets the same quality requirements as an overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software are interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in current disruptions with the cost of avoiding this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to 50 euro; this is only a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. at the end, you should always remember all the cables before you go on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can use it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are in comparison to the hard drives at home however very expensive - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparably slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your pictures in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">The web solutions are very safe from the point of view of the data backup. transfer errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain on the computer. all transfers are vulnerable to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs provide at least data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred, not when this happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you open one day a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS of Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk errors on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows is available.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in Alpha status. it uses the same protection mechanisms using the ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data loss in the notebook and 46% of the workstation systems. in case of laptops, the percentage of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; has not been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFS and XFS to name the most widespread file systems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: wrong, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file was not saved completely before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human error are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical boundaries. it is meant that as the technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is already too high for compact cameras and a high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions, you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so make anyone responsible for data loss. 6% of all PCs are affected every year from a data loss. therefore, backup your data frequently in accordance with a plan and test this backup before you make any hazardous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the replacement of disks or the resizing of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your fuses on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash strikes you lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane accidents: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of the physical separation: as said above, a common reason for a data loss despite security is the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time in which such a backup was made. this backup is the closest one with the exception that is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP meetings or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of the files that were really changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have stored them on your computer on a DVD or other optical media.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure gives you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you get a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata, stored in the image file IPTC data, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, retrieving images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, viewing devices,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">In order for valuable pictures to survive the next 40 years that is about the time span you really are interested in because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable due to your nature, you have to consider all that is said today with caution and evaluate anew while time goes by. unfortunately, you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your images, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned the scalability and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new record was detected by the system, but don't hang it up.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of the disk in MBO; # works with ext2,3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadc1 # change the size of the number if necessary</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day there is no more software that can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will become easier by year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market, so you shouldn't use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG has been developed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC Metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignments on heterogeneous platforms.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a license-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. it is developed on the TIFF / EP format and required to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already providing DNG and we hope the competitor Canon and Nikon will use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image Resource block; .XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmptu; stored for XML / RDF.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in raw format. XMP fits because it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, you should consider whether you are using DNG as a container and put everything together there.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections, and enlightening efforts to achieve far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the images are on the camera directory, you can use this as temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layer editing, you can use external programs. if you edit the images again & edited, then you should add the metadata again. these were under certain circumstances cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them only in web galleries, encode in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; to get. in the addition of a photo to an album you will find a description of how you can add photos you already have on your hard disk. however, the camera interface provides you many advanced settings for importing images to your Albendatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on. another description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera will appear. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol for the file, photos, movies, music etc. are displayed on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the sidebars properties and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog shows file characteristics and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The tab metadata displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as the Metadata page toolbar from the main window of & edited; or the image processing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this downloads all photos of your camera into a single album in & digiplug;. downloading the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures were securely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all the photos, you can select only those you want with the default selection methods of & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download button and select Selected. the selected button can be downloaded as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New is available. these images have not yet been edited by & digiplug; downloaded. in this case, the new images are selected with a star in the preview window. if you choose this option, only the new images are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">If you use the All or Selected buttons, a dialog appears with which you can select the destination album in which the photos are stored. you can read the list of existing albums in the My Albums section. select the destination album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once, by using the Delete All button. if you only want to delete some, you need to select them first and then delete the selected delete.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to recover photos that you have deleted from the camera. you should therefore carefully check if the photos were successfully deleted into a & digiplug; you should carefully check if you want to remove them from the camera. if you want to delete the camera cher completely, you should do this via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras use as file names for the photos often not particularly meaningful names. the file names are normally used again after the photos were deleted from the camera. this can cause duplicate filenames if you upload photos from different recording sets into the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time on which the image was taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for turning and mirroring the image and for database-based sub-albums. if you use this latter option, a folder is created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The first two relate the data to the author in the section Standard Autory Identity. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information to the IPTC Fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you want a different date format than the standard format, you can use the prefix photo% Y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S in the edit field. to do this, turn off the date & time option. for more customizations, you should read the support strftime.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you use the camera filename option, you will have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters, or in capital letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new filename, which & edited; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview. your renaming settings are stored and automatically used when you open the next time the camera window.</seg>
<seg id="267">& edited; can use all information about the camera's orientation to the point of time recording to perform an automatic rotation during the download. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't deliver this information, & digiplug; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic rotation, use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the lower part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, you can use it to automatically create sub-albums in the target album. all images with the same date are uploaded to the same sub-album. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section, you can check which information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually turned off, and in this case saves & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog box appears, where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asks & digiplug; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder chooser dialog appears for the camera. select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload. the images are not deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this means a position indicated in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be done by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatically recording the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser showing the area with a click. if you want to send a postcard to another, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is how to get the GPS data in the picture? first you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. the question is actually more how the data will come into these fields? there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the right hardware, through a post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographic mapping (manual) and last via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit. but there are a few who work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmitting the data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from one device can be done using gpsman or gpsbabel. you need to save this data in gpx format, as this is the only format supported by the geographic mapping module.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of pictures and GPS. on the following page you can do the same: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the degrees and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the accidentals of havred coordinates created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& edited; tries to give you as much control over its workflows as possible. there are many settings that the behavior of & digikam. change. to access these settings, you must set up in the Settings menu. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on embedded preview or editing image editing. you specify the default behavior of & digiplug; fixed when you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardization and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also during a database synchronization, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for the author line: this field should include the photographer's job title. this can be names such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a more detailed description of the author field, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Editor is a synonym for providers: use this field to specify the photo. this does not have to be the author, if it works for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here as this is the image of others & quot;. if the image is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the image will be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC rims. it is achieved that metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digiplug;. this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported; imported without getting lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image inscriptions as embedded inscriptions (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. thus, your captions can also be read by other picture viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the information that appears when the mouse pointer is in the main window above a file. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digiplug; to view, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. each file in a digiplug; Album Folder that has none of these extensions will be ignored by & Edit; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the button Update to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">You can set the default values on this page. however, each time you open the light table these settings will be switched on if possible. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. if you have one then you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select it here. you can disable the toolbar if you use image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">Chroma-Subsampling means that the images are coded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the colour information. please read this article in Wikipedia for more information.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 a high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the TIFF file option, you can compress the delate compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality, since the delate algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting of lossless JPEG 2000 files, you can save lossless. even if you select the loss-prone setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JPEG. when this paragraph has been written, metadata has not yet been supported, but was in the planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & edited, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react to more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels on odd rows, this difference creates a grid pattern in the output. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used when the white balance is not set. standard is to use a solid color balance based on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that under exposed images in four steps more details can get in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The standard is the top lights, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned, due to the inability of your camera to capture the pointed lights, as through continuous white. use the setting of continuous white in the settings. last but not least, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as quickly as green and red. & redkam, and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the still not saturated blue pixels. of course, this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it slightly higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the editing options of the & digiplug; image processing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A demo voicing algorithm is a digital image process in order to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">And Drapw provides you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG Interpolation and AHD Interpolation. after some tests it looks so. VNG Interpolation (Variable number of gradients) was the first algorithm used by Drapw. it creates color artefacts on the edges. bilinear is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for color grading correction, as it is performed during raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to restore it. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information how to translate color information from one color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when an image is opened in image editing / color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color profile folders set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you save all your profiles. & edited; then examines this folder during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have the option & quot; default squot; for your profiles to be stored here. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here only your pictures do not color the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like e.g. Canon, that do not color tone mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma isn't correcting 16 bit depth. this means that you have to do the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are more options like the Soft Proof Profile, which you can emulate as your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print image because your printer has a smaller color area than your camera and some colors therefore can work very saturated. this could be manually adjusted, rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it's pretty obvious which color profile is intended for. unfortunately, not with the models of Canon. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is of course inofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension lets you realize the style for the target: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a series of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by providing this interface, & digiplug can support; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has installed the KIPI modules, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these are then downloaded by & digiplug; these modules will appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition you will find some also in the context menu of the Previews.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by Modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper control adjusts the time between the picture transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the images while the ad is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show a list of all the currently supported cameras on the left. on the right side there is a button auto detection, which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, switched on and in picture display mode. currently, here are serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage supports.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active when you select a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & edited; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera model and port manually. once you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can paste it all here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the confirmation dialog for moving &gt; images to the trash bin, you can display the dialog from & Edit; when deleting a photo into an album, you will find further details in the deleting a photo and deleting an album.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes by the right sidebar can be tacitly applied by & Edit; apply if you use the option changes in the right side bar without prompting. otherwise, you will need to save the changes using the button Changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also sign & Edit splash screen display; disable when starting. this will speed up the start process of & digiplug;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The Set Beim start looking for new photos forces forces & digiplug; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this lengthens the start time of & digiplug;. if something has been deleted from the base folder, asks & digiplug; you, if it should delete it from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be in & edited; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected in Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug; to create, you will find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& edited; provides fast image editing with some basic tools. you can use it to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on thumbnail preview and selecting the item View / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image editing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digiplug; so you may not be part of your distribution. for more information about the KIPI modules, see the section Image Processing.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnifying factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top edge, including the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or the Save button from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">You should possibly make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with file Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or using the button The button Restore image processing in the toolbar. you will then lose any change that you have done in the photo since the last store.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any image editing action can be undone or restored. the last action can be undone by restoring or restoring the Edit Restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should use the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and remember Ctrl; -Conschalt-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press a button for a moment on the return or restore button in the toolbar, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between will also be undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started image editing, you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword, using the navigation buttons in the tool bar, picture high, down picture or using the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes in the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter the photo and zoom out into which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the view menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select Enlarger</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode. you enter the normal view where you use the Esc key. normally, you can see this in the Edit dialog from & Edit; edit it from the Edit & Edit menu. see the section for setting up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select Print Image from the File menu and get the standard & kde; print dialog. you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or entire sentences. entire image preview finishes can be printed from your selection. you just need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Export Collection Wizard. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & edited; main window has a sidebar at the right edge, which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrows, even in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Repeated clicking on the same tab allows the sidebar to appear or disappear into the border again.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the caption view you can type or insert labels with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are permitted. the lettering is copied into the EXIF and IPTC Fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are deformed. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should note these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented on it, use either the user button or simply switch to the next image, the descriptions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">In addition to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database. however, you can also write the metadata in the files. however, this is always done when you choose a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written in the IPTC field Urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword overview shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords applied in this & edited session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the entered keyword. you can limit the number of possibilities in search for a keyword quickly. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The entry field at the bottom is a further relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you have entered different keywords, these will be saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not to the entire selection if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword filters are used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, date, keyword and search views. if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed. all created keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop key words. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day. the keyword filter stands on No keywords, which reduces the amount to three images. you have been selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword from the right keyword has been drawn to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at any start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Various.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or its, you can easily change it by double-clicking on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">For example, you can set a Advanced search on all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you need only the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group button. the options then look as follows:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? the free disk space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution there.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was mainly written by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I wrote it mainly on & edited; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why one uses a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanners come with a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor are similar to those of your camera or scanners and that the colors that you print or publish in your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflow. in addition, you should provide links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow fulfills all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about colour management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You are working on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Your only other picture issues are e-mail or web where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should I use a different color space to think about colour management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual sample of sRGB limitation in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in sRGB colour space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I have to sound my monitor if I chose to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in sRGB colour space or not, you need to use your monitor as sRGB means that your; onitor carries the circle. if you work as in sRGB colour space, you must either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, use a matching monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, compensate, Automatic balance and contrast extend from the Correcting Automatic correction menu to automatically make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the luminous values over the entire image, so that the darkest dot is black and the brightest dot becomes as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Matching: this method adjusts the intensity factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. this results in very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic matching: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and bright limit tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Enhance contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the largest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible with washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space with 8 bits per color is worked. so if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction are better avoided.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyright by Pawel T. Jochronym.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left side you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will dynamically adjust the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance then click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The target image preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel below this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above, a histogram shows that dynamically changes when you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful since even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dimming shadow details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the default settings list. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly this. each setting of the white balance you have set allows you to save it into a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences knob returns all filter values to its default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save it, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. colour mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is to find in the menu with color grading correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to use them for several photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The digiplug; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also called Sabatier, was an effect that was created by using a partially developed pressure of a short flash light and afterwards inverted the development of the image. the colored, darker areas protected the delicate photographic paper from the additional light.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar process. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar installation effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called "Velviaot" effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated color in daylight and high contrasts. the characteristics make it a film of choice for wildlife photographers.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeats the thickness of the neon light. for large images, the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not unusual for you to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can experiment to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tool gradation and the simple lens thickness / contrast / gamma, the tool is positioned to improve exposure. even if the dialog is very complicated to this tool, you only need the area of the slider for the application here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked inside and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control and to observe how the image changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right you can see the original and the preview of the picture. the preview will be dynamically updated based on the settings of the picture. on the left, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this selection box it is possible to specify whether the histogram is displayed with linear or logarithmic y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear layout is most suitable. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case the logarithmic division is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three regulators: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pinheads can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the values of shadows, middle and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded later. to do this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input will be adjusted automatically for all shadows, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the preview of the original image to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only previewed and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left side displays half of the original and the target image. the preview will be dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this selection box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box there are two symbols to switch between a linear and a logarithmic view. for images captured using a digital camera is mostly the linear mode of the most sensible. for images with large areas of constant color, linear mode creates a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve to the right, for example the bright sounds, you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker output tones and that the related image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos to see a red marker. if you want to shift this mark to the area you want to change, a matching line will appear on the curve representing the original value. create a dot on this line and move it to and down until the value is adjusted according to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. each curve that you created can be stored in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, means and sun tones. enable the color pipette you want to use and click the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminous curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if found in more than one channel, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only previewed and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set using the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">"" "the" "" "Edit & digiplug" "" "channel mixer; image editing is a tool for improving color channels or changing the color shades of the photos." ""</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how you can correct the channels by looking at the relative distribution and impact. the left part of the window shows you a preview.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right below: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the picture will retain the general brightness as well, as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when mixed with monochrome, the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the color space. the color space consists of small diamond-artefacts that do not appear at the same spot in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel looks different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to find overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only previewed and there is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been re-adjusted. the option Luminance is enabled. the original image can be seen below (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film rolls profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenery images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure using a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day. thus, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Red filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: generates warm light and medium tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of having a pressure and redevelopment in a Sepiatoner. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; apply the texture texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper textured effect has been applied in the picture below. the original image is (1) and the modified one (2) to be seen. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; Tool frames Add can be a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a beholder in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image. throughout, the picture moves with a coloured line, nipce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white pictures), rounded off with a nice three dimensional frame which is ideal for a knock effect and decorative inserts a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this convenient tool, you can insert easily a formatted text into an image at any place. this can also be done in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply insert the text and place it with the mouse. you will need to customize the text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need. finally, simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you selected for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; Tool templates can apply a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu apply in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template, there are no limitations concerning the size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the template, just send an email in english to the & digiplug; mailinglist digiplug-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you have copied the template files. these settings will be scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the templates, a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the Template folder appears. selecting a folder automatically updates the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">There are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this knob increases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Size: this button decreases the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to reduce the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digiplug; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very quick and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurred mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. in fact, it does not sharpen a bit, it works rather psychologically. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes a really good job. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is probably the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for customization.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus, as well as most digitized images require correction of sharpness. this is because of the digitization process colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges becoming a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">JPEG images often have a camera internal sharpening. images in raw format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpener already while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control over your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. you can call it with the menu entry Conducting sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should handle this carefully, as the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, the most suitable technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you can find more information on the menu entry. below refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the image a little soft is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Conducting soft molluscs and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog will show you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter non-sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. you can see a demonstration here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help you to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tested first. if you make the blurring mask too strong, noise and the impression of grates near sharp edges will produce.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. this makes the sharpness of the sharpness set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the use difference amount. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred mask was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digiplug; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Detection-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries a picture to & quot; refocused quot; in which it reverses defocusing. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Vienna filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is usually better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by calling colors refocused in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauss'sche fold. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also dependent on the source pixelae, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese inverse of the Gauß's folding is strongly influenced by the distant pixels.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should have 1 good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1, eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are only rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further deteriorate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss' sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is nonzero. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you might have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Die size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the die size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the Gaussian sharpness. note however that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should select a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity adjustments on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, which later leave uncomfortable artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurring masking a larger neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp mask must always produce artefacts. even under optimum conditions it can never be possible to remove the effect of the blurring. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in the processing of small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp picture has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the follow-up methods in digital images, you can consult a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider sets the blurring of the darkened area to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The color tinted ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen, France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available default settings are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothing over the image. whereas larger values tend to smooth homogeneous regions and allow details to be sharp. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening should be subsequently subordinated to the direction dependency.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes out uniformly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is only smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulation or CCD noise will produce a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set the more will be smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, there should also be a small selection. make sure that small angles produce a long runtime. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0.1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value less than 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more quality you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to let him out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly this. correcting any setting of image errors can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is relatively quick at work. however, it may take a long time to load a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see there is a strange black artifact in the foreground that caused by a poor film shift during the journey. the original image is below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & edited; noise reduction is a very powerful tool for reducing noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens, too. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on the sensor noise of digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed by this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">Below you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced Settings dialog can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter per pixel needs and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller errors are corrected.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel pitch to the front to determine luminance changes. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG-artifacts without loosing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve an image. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more blurred, but also eliminates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustment of the phase jitter damping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother, if it is too high, noise and phase jitter appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crunchy for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than sharpening a picture. use the tool to soften the soft sign with the menu entry Conducting soft molluscs and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration method gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauss's noise, film granulation, scratches, compression artifacts and local mistakes that occur in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefakte reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a loss-prone compression algorithm, it generates some compressions & quot; arteftequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons make this exactly this. any setting of photo restoration can be saved into a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively quick at work. however, it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on one Ilford (tm) HP-5 Film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film granulation on the faces. the original image is below (1) and the corrected below (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures have been applied to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts that were caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image can be seen below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">Die & digiplug; tool Hotpixels makes it possible to remove pictures using a CCD camera gem. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are protected by copyright by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and 'quot; bright pixel quot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file into the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to capture the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD Defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the matching darkimage to the picture to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and preview will help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">Durcut: an average of the neighboring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the faulty pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square corners (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubical curves (1-dim), which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digiplug; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the iris filter, which increases the required shutter speed under certain circumstances, which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an aperture of f / 16 or smaller, as otherwise blurring effects are caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's felt and color depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a ccentric filter by using an equivalent transformation on a raw image without this filter. the vignetting correction tool turns the transformation into a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of intensity absorption at the point of greatest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which creates an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide positive values, since you only have to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, leave the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the & digiplug; image processing from the color gradation menu.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected picture.</seg>
<seg id="575">Die & digikam; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. colour distortion cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circuit effect, but flattens on the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth degree corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometrical distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the distortion of the distortion part of the second degree. with negative values, distortion-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of distortion 4. this value appears more strongly at the margins than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter' has the inverted character of the parameter General.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and results in a correction first. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the picture. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase them.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog contains a preview of the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The ton- or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before any cutting or size changes. ideally, perform this correction first. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a toned correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal support line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the ton- / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove it with the cutting tool in the menu Transformers Cutting out of image processing or using the zoom regulator of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some subjects such as photographs from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand, you will always have an easy distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the barrel-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate infrared film of the Gimpguru.org website which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfra movie, see this URL. this movie has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the section for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture.</seg>
<seg id="592">Under the preview you can set two parameters to simulate movie granularity and film sensitivity (ISO). enable Include movie granulation if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film granularity and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in conversion. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes ink ducts for reproducing infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos since the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is shown below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; Filter film granulation is an easy-to-use tool for reproducing film granulation on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix great silver grains of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The cinematic effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, granular view especially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although higher values are often required, set to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film granulation effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that processed the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; Filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & edited; Filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting. nature images and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">The upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothing or, viewed from the other side, the sharpness.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the editing is marked with the (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smoothing 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digiplug; filter charcoal drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a coal sketch. the lines that define the outlines in the drawing are emphasized. images of whose gradients slowly change are not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine the scene you chose to outline you. these would be good pictures to start with it.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smoothing).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the charcoal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digiplug; filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digiplug; Filter Grain is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important one on the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, Mongolian landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filter. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraver filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and let it look as if it is seen through glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the wave-blocks 1, the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom sharpness: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from a center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurred the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring: blurred the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographed, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking: blurring the image by randomly shifting the pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrarily moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color paddles in the picture and blurbs it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photograph into rectangular cells and then recreates it by filling with an average pixel value.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Stop.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops to your image. this gives it a wet appearance to your pictures. it uses a computer protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the droplets. since the droplet size does not automatically increase with the size of the image it is often necessary to decrease the size for small images. number alters the number and density of drops. fish eyes changes the visual effect of drops on the image.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can keep an area free from raindrops using the Edit & Edit menu. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter of raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrop filter. the original image (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. you can find the tools in the menu Transformers Rotate or Transformers Spy.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo bubbles is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with a minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you blow up a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into an image when the limits of resolution are reached? how can you recover the missing information or guess? the CImg algorithm which is used here makes here a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. select to change Transformers size in the menu and specify the target values.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation for enlarging an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm Photo blown was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool you want to change the size. these settings are available in the New Size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is checked, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set the more will be smoothed. this is necessary when a lot of noise is present, as it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to produce a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load Buttons are used exactly for this purpose. each stallying for photo can be saved as a text file and can be loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time to load a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example for photo bubbles by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear standard magnification for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. to cut a photo you just have to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while moving the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. this will give you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be trimmed by dragging on the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button The trimming button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut to size (Ctrl; + X). use the file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly edited photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="644">When trimming the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Trimming the aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">Below in the dialog, you can use the Max. relation knob to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">The tool According to the aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the orientation (horizontal or vertical). if you use the trimming tool the next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the interconnect help make it possible to hide help in order to better assemble your pictures. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-level rule, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden Middle: the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things we perceive as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden pitch is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks who designed their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; from where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous numbers.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother helpers when you put together a picture. these help are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. in comparison to the third-rule, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this type of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flux in this way.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The golden triangles also derive from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonals to these lines can be made a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersections and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirroring and mirroring options can be used to reflect the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the auxiliary lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the auxiliary lines can become invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are rotated by an angle. you can do this with the & digiplug; image processing and tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the Preferences knob, you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After turning a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transformers cut from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic crop function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the rotation. note, however, the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspectival transformations are performed at a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: shows the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Corner left above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Corner right above: indicates the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Corner left below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Corner right below: indicates the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image is a little greased. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you have adjusted the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformers cut from the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The loosening tool is used to shift part of the image in one direction and move the other part to the opposite direction. for example, the upper part of the image is shifted to the right and the lower part to the left. this is no rotation, the image is distorted into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Draw your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview area.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the loosening tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the image is blurred. for a single calibration this effect is usually negligible, but two lines producing twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After lubrication, the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transforming cutting from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digiplug; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug;</seg>

<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digiplug; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images. redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. generally there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless if specified in the settings.</seg>

<seg id="716">In the Portfolio dialog, you can select from a list of installed pallets, or browse the folders for files.</seg>
<seg id="717">The cursor is shown in the pallet view as a line. it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color.</seg>
<seg id="718">It shows the color beside it. the color is described under the pallet view. here the color name can also be changed.</seg>
<seg id="719">It can also be used to select. to create such a selection, click on the area next to a color to move the cursor to it. then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="720">If the check box Inm cursor is activated under the button color, the color is pasted from the color panel on the cursor. the color is either inserted or overwrites a different; depending on whether the mode is selected overwriting. this mode can be set by selecting the check box overwriting under the cursor cursor.</seg>
<seg id="721">A selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions to copy, cut and paste.</seg>
<seg id="722">& kcoloredit; uses the following format for data in the clipboard: for each color three values for the proportions of red, green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line-end character, if another color follows. if so, three figures in the clipboard can be inserted as a color in & kcoloredit;</seg>
<seg id="723">The colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphically; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; diagrams. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program included & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project aims to replace these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphically; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot. the & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphically; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly GUI; it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration into & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change in the graph will be calculated and displayed in & kgraphically;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; to open or to open the graph in & kgraphiviewer; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Loading large graphs (currently there are problems starting about 1000 nodes and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphically; is a & kde; program, which presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate sub-window. initially, if you start & kgraphically; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the symbol file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot files, the main window looks like in the lower screenshot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is larger than the canvas. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by factor 10. below you see the maximum size reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph should be recharged or if you want to ignore the change. & kgraphically; can also note your decision, so that it will be used later. if you want to change your decision later, you can set up the menu item Settings kgraphically; see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graph file outside a current & kgraphiviewer, or eg; in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; or want to display the graph to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but change it later with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you run the program, you can open all graphs of your last session. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how to split the graph to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the portions of the graph that come on one page will be adjusted to this page. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled by the respective sections of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with one on several pages distributed graphene without headline and with another font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Load site gives the option to specify behavior when a file was altered to the hard drive, eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or program the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open site provides the ability to set the behavior of & kgraphiviewer; specify when a graph is opened outside a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a sub-window of the already running session) or determine that every time it is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to set the start behavior of & kgraphiviewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not) or specify a default behavior (the files from the last session or not) or determine to be asked at each start afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears with a click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up further possibilities:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered graphs of directional graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for non-aligned graphene. it produces representations based on the spring spring model. it uses the Kamada Kawai algorithm, which is synonymous with statistic multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm creates a bounce spring model for ungrounded graphs. it uses the Fruitman pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-grid solver for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm assigns the knot circularly in accordance with the description of Six und Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that is executed by a shell. the command should accept the graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give & eg; den & graphviz; algorithms perform special options, or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of the graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type (dot; for directional, & neato; for numbered graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this option is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: uses the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the scanned image, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to get the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that the Kooka window will appear by replacing the default ducts default values to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the button scanning, you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to set the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the type BMP is not compressed and therefore very large files created. you must also select the folder & # 160; select or create by saving the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screen shots you can create after you have selected in the Importer &gt; Screen photo menu. a window appears in which you can set the different screen photomodes:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program window is selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workstation. if you have selected the entire desktop, only the window will be read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts. if you need to switch to other workspaces, you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog of the target image appears with the options already described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr allows you to send his photos to people that are important to you. you can show your favorite photos of the world, make photos of your camera online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The exporting module to Flickr can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be led by the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication. so, it is your ID to Flickr. a browser is launched to allow you to login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After the successful registration the module can send pictures to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after you have pressed Yes, you get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">When the module exporting to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which shows the current access permissions that the module displays. currently, the module does not support any other permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button lets you add photos once you have set all other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. when you press the Ok button, the upload of the photos to Flickr server starts.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keywords field can be filled with a comma-delimited list of words. these are added to the image as key words during high loading.</seg>
<seg id="804">With the options open, friends and Famillie you can adjust the access permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you select the option Modify the size of the photos before uploading, the photos before uploading will be changed in size. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>
<seg id="807">The KIPI module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server</seg>
<seg id="808">The KIPI module gallery export does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="809">The geographical location of the KIPI module allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF section of the image and the localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools for locating geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and latitude are used here.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data, you need a GPS trace as an XML file in gpx-format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization correlator. this interface can lead a number of previously selected images together with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the top-to-see dialog will then appear. in order to result in a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera length must be converted to GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera zone here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for the maximum time variance gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below the data is merged together. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have appropriate data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlate to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful when you have made a number of photos at the same location. since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next, you only need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set by the displayed card. select the region in question and increase sie.Run this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between card mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module picture gallery is a tool for exporting a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to allow for the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selector allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right, you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the sample preview and the text will appear in the header of the HTML page.</seg>
<seg id="824">The Rider Appearance defines the general appearance and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. the option for each image creates a gallery in which each image also gets its own page. if you then click on a picture a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default image viewer,</seg>
<seg id="825">The Album defines the settings where and how the gallery is to be saved with all your associated images. select a folder where you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLExport which contains everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">You can change the default color depth with other color depth. of course it also affects the file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnail allows you to customize some of the settings from the Album Rider for thumbnails, which are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">When the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occurred during the creation. the web browser will be automatically launched at the end to preview the preview of the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. for example, this can be found in the PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool for connecting your computer with a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI-Team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy from the main program and then invoke the Import function. this then opens the file selection dialog where you want to copy the target image.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write into each target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please refer to iv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG encoder module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG encoder module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file in the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slide show. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Diaschau. after that you can create the module via Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of images or the content of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preconfigured and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that displays a picture. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value produces very sudden, a high contrast very smooth image changes.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG output file. keep the extension mpg as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start the creation of the movie with the button. depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the Slideshow when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If an indication appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can adjust the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the button Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print multiple images on one sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp. this is, for example, useful to improve or print with the Gimp module directly.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your images stored in RAW to one of three formats of JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect from dcraw not that it produces the same results as the software from your camera creator. sometimes you get with dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to convert and launch the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image. with the button Preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance. the essential parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the picture later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected for you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch does not have any effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you're satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename will remain the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes for it.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, retains all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or later use them elsewhere, you shouldn't choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deteriorated. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose to JPEG as a storage format, the metadata contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG data in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the trigger button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">The batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at once. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar indicates how far the conversion is advanced.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in an album. it uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can reduce or enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on the orientation of the image. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen size.</seg>
<seg id="870">Non-proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. this option changes the aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="871">Preparation: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, will be adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images in advance.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the images window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images to the images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be displayed on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the list of images and drop them there to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the button removal, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After selecting all the images you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the OK button. you only have to add the addresses and the subject. the pictures you selected are attached as attachments.</seg>
<seg id="877">Pay attention not to sending too many images at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of sending emails. it might be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window is used to change the settings for sending images. your configuration is stored and used again each time you change them.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in an attached file, the comments will be added to the images in a text file and added the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats like TIFF. you should therefore use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG under Pictures file format and are the original files in JPEG format, then the original exifdata will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can see the status messages on the search for errors. your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Slideshow, a window with questions like you would like to have displayed your slide show appears. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL-Transitions option in the presentation will enable very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The file name option displays that the file name of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in an endless loop. you can then manually cancel it with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select make sure that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time interval between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds are equal to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transitional effects between which you can select. randomly, each transition between images chooses a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar at the upper left edge of the screen. move the mouse into this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this toolbar you can pause the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the left bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the location of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have any documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Note: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module Background is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected submenu option, as a background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations, you can browse & kphotoalbum; browse through these, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the image, there are now in every group, i.e. in people, places and in group keywords.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your pictures and videos with annotations. additionally there are entries to look for EXIF-based information, view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse on the entry, the view of the browser will change. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person you will only see the images on which both persons are to be seen. by this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images to a few single pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all the people, places and other settings, you can use thumbnails to view the images of your sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the image, each person has the same symbol in front of their name. they can store their own thumbnail with & kphotoalbum, but this also applies to places, keywords and other categories you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images next to the names, select the button located on the right of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can view e.g. symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable pictures for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must choose which image should be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the image view window (in more detail) and select the image for the corresponding person in the context menu. now you can select the image for the corresponding person. in the view window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image should be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you enter the Find entry in the main window, a dialog appears that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog on the image again.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the labeling or description field, the descriptions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to search for; the date can be either a part of the total datas, for example 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two data, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the bottom of the window you can search all pictures by certain names, as you can see in the picture. here is shown on pictures, on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User Manual for & kphotoalbum; if you do not like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functionality, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the Homepage of & kphotoalbum; and watch the fast entry, screenshots and introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, select the demo if you start & kphotoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu entry kphotoalbum; launch demo. then some sample images will be loaded and you can try the functions of & kphotoalbum; try them.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the Homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a related HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name says, it displays date statistics on the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays a different unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image of this date will be displayed in the preview toolbar) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview view.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the timestamps. if you select an area, preview only images of this time period. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides two possibilities to create HTML pages with your pictures. the one is available in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). the following part of the user manual is described in & kphotoalbum; integrated version that you can create via the File HTML... menu.</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages, you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout, and finish. in the following, each area is described more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description, which should contain the HTML file later. on kphotoalbum; HTML-sample pages you can see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a & kphotoalbum; -export file should be created which is visible on the overview page.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to appear on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid displaying information that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that & kphotoalbum; currently, all images are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this section you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why it is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. this means that those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 do not need to download images, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have set. so you can search your images with low resolution, which results in a lower transmission time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting, you specify the various folders and the URL where your site is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">Best select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the main folder in which all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and next time automatically added. this allows you to select the location for all future images. here you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if these are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages have been created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. to enable the import function, see, properly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described above have all three related to base folders and URLs. a subfolder will be created in them, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family party, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the images. however, if you have already spent a lot of time applying the image information, people on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you need to do this work with & kphotoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file, which can import others into your database.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a shortcut to images. the advantage of storing all the images in the file is that you can have all the pictures together and share this file so independently. however, the obvious drawback is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can create a .kin file either directly from the File Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kin file along with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in a twofold way. first, it scans the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following describes the dialog for exporting images that you can access via the File Export menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">If you want to copy manually to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatically option to copy to the .kim file, copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most pictures have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .kim file would otherwise be very large. here you can limit the size by saying, for example, that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Importer menu, & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the importing images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog box to import the categories of the file to be imported and which categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can reconcile the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual, you will go through the various steps of (1) setting the information about your images, via (2) browsing and watching, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures, but it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual you talk about pictures, but often this also includes videos.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copying to a disk or revisions in CVS, where you want them.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; notice the folder where your images are stored and automatically reuse it for future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / company / images / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Via the Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can go to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will find the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different icons, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting there is a detailed help available, which you can call by pressing a button on the F1 key and one click on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each image, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">You can see the dialog used to process existing groups. for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the section subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group set at once in a group rather than all groups of a member like explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the left half of the window you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this modular system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface. more information can be found on the homepage of Kipi.</seg>
<seg id="958">Modules can and will not be described in this manual because they are not part of & kphotoalbum; but most of the modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used together by multiple applications, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own images The & kphotoalbum; demo database can be accessed either by command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use via KIPI are very different, so it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; not working. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications record their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order of albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">In addition to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have to pass a list of albums. here & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then every entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you have set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do, so whether you would have selected persons to view and pass it on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. start the setup dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used from any other KDE application, you will see a menu and a toolbar at the top. under the toolbar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database. currently, we will return to this window, but now click on the pictures to show you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see each image with annotations. this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture, where the image was taken. you can set each image either individually or for a larger number of pictures simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these comments can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these notes if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">You can see three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you will always use them once more, when you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on shifting the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are mapped, you can find that the names used are moved up to find and assign people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to receive an alphabetically sorted list, click on the Sorting icon after the date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add these images with annotations. in this case simply click on the front and back buttons below the image to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have taken several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Multiple entries at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S., and San Francisco and Los Angeles are in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window displaying the USA as an overview. to show you that it is an overboard, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialogs context menu it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new category or sub-category. in addition, you can simply drag and drop an entry to a subcategory of this entry.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by dragging it outside the window pane.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button. among other things, you can save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to get this window being displayed again later, use the button options... and here you can see the window in / out. this process can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the pictures in your browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you have not set a filter. for example, you can see the size of thumbnails, by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button, configuring it. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop an image on the background of your desktop, this image is set as background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, this will be shown in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the corresponding images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete Selection from the Edit menu. now the window will be displayed that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use with & kphotoalbum; you can also use the images somewhere, thus & kphotoalbum; you can see the view from & kphotoalbum; if not all the necessary pictures can be loaded from the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is cut is not stored on the hard disk. however, for the images 5-9 the thumbnails are present, so & kphotoalbum; you can view these images as well. you can also not view these images with the picture viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you see this feature requires that you copy files from the folders and then copy them back into it. & kphotoalbum; if you want to avoid irritation about how to avoid mixing your images, please purchase a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the Image menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures in such a way that at the end those remain who wish to make you inaccessible for others and click Current View locking in the Privacy Menu. alternatively, you can also select all the images that your little sister may view, and lock the menu item except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have set which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item pictures to lock, so that all the images that you have locked are hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which needs to be typed to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select the password from the privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">For one, everyone who can access the file index.xml may read or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar with the view to private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you are all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to consider it sometime. for this reason & kphotoalbum; via an image _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">The viewer can see you. it naturally shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the information box on the upper part of the image you want to see, you can also drag and drop them somewhere else. you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all. all of these options are available after right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the InfoBox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the appropriate entries for this. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the images of Anne Helene. as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have loaded multiple images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons picture high and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be accessed from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If multiple images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & kphotoalbum; then loads a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; is it able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete place on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can move in and out into the image. you can easily pull out a rectangle with the mouse. the plus key zooms in in the middle of the picture. shows how a zooming rectangle is marked and shows the zooms result.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the point key you can reset your zoom so that the image is not zoomed. with the Sync button sets the zooms, so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work in videos that are in and out with the plus and minus key are.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can turn the image. this does not work with videos. you can make notes on the current image using the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture. in the moment you can view this and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper. to see which photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to paint pictures with features while you look at them. features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by clicking the corresponding letter. in this you see a picture where the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">Once you have put features on your pictures, they are available to you in your browser. so if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add them all at once with notes. this is described in. after that you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview view. if you let categories display in a preview view, then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. you can see this here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case you allow & kphotoalbum; to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In order to switch the painting mode from & kphotoalbum; switch on the picture from the context menu. to finish the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the program & Povray; not fully proficient but the documentation on & Povray; should you absolutely have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wiremodell- views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an already selected object, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the toolbar icon or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu will be displayed to allow you to select the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">Deleting either from the menu bar under Edit, or from the right mouse button context menu, you can remove selected objects from the scene previously.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and then click Apply or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">If you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press a preview in the property view and a small sample of the scene will be rendered with the texture selected. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you wish to render a part of the texture (for example, a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map), tick locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is shown in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as absolute value. objects will only be displayed if they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level selected in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmoder; has a window order as default. the object tree and view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the standard window order or if you need a different arrangement, you can set it arbitrarily. you can also store multiple windows orders and simply switch between different arrangements.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or below a present view, drag the starter to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle indicates the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the starter to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on one another, you drag the starter in the middle of another view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the card tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to resolve a view from the anchorage, drag the starter to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing to the left in the chamfering bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the chamfering bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu you will find entries for each type of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any place.</seg>
<seg id="1034">You can save the current window view with View window order... save it. it will display a dialog where you can save the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render it. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 is up-to-date. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0 is not supported.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click on Rendering The Rendering icon in the toolbar, or select Rendering the View Scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview up to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar, or in the View Render mode... select, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense to use a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the quality drop down menu you can select the properties that & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the User Manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one ray per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a Moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than a ray per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because of the super-sampling the neighboring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively, because each pixel is repeatedly broken down and adaptive because the recuperation depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you select the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam of pixels. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference then is:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the predefined threshold, the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are further followed and tested for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. when you turn on Jittering, changes & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for renderns quality is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray;, the diffuse light reflection calculates. it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can specify whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the associated beams have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly finished, you can find the reason here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray scene, select File Importer... and select a file in the dialog window.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supports & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command scope of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog window displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; want to import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for & Povray; this adds the source code of the object into the opened text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can include source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on help in the property view, open & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; user documentation for the displayed object. set the path to your document and the version here. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (such as elevation field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type features.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object catch of the points on the grid in the context menu of the wire model views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time for rendering. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the level of detail for two directions separately.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross High detail fidelity for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections. this feature results in a better approach for projections, but requires more time for rendering.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross a wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you cross the floor, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a chessboard pattern of two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing windows orders or create new window orders. in the section window orders, it explains how you can create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The standard window order drop down: displays all existing window arrangements. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders shows all existing windows arrangements. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views for the selected window order. new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New column, you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows, with unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with card board you get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating up the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start with no more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this tutorial, you should be able to create the ultimate yet simple scene, among beginners is very popular: a sphere on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you don't set a camera, no rules for rendering can be applied, as a result you get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you don't include sources of light, your entire scene is in the dark and you will only get a black image.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything error free, see the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing toolbar icons. please read the documentation so that you can get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will often have to use these menus and symbols, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this tutorial first you need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the Edit Delete menu item. so you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The view of the scene from the camera's point of view shows you the scene from the camera's point of view. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the various parameters of the camera can be found. in the user documentation on & Povray; see for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is reserved for later instructions, but note that the camera in the view has control points with which you can change the point of view of the camera. simply click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When you press the user button or the Enter key, the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. for example, you could insert a box (insert final body boxes) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome way to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually offers a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as a floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or Enter. in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, even if at the moment only as a limited finite level. if you render the scene, the plane will expand up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you view the object tree exactly, you will notice that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case, you will only find the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the practice a unit under the horizontal line just to get to know some of these parameters. select shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to set its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens in which you can select how to insert the object. the pigment is then displayed in the property tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = bottom-pigment), with a click on the button Preview you see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the pigment preview only shows a matte black material because you have to input settings for the pigment. always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the Quader and Sphere in the preview, then click on the Apply button and then go to the Preview button.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now with a click on the symbol, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course this is not the color you expected. here are more settings necessary. in the color list you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this also more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">Choose the color in the object tree each time and change the colors in the view of the object properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should already do this step, since you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be easily done just like the floor:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In view of object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or the user button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground, as you have moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now results in a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">Once you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as with the ground, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Choose the first object and change the name for example in sphere pigment. click on sphere pigment, then select Colors and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as shown in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The adjustment of gloss effect and reflection already results in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metal is not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what possibilities you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracing is a Render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three-dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical beams from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog effect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also don't see anything, the image is just black. obviously, every scene you want to be rowed requires, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you need to enter a name and disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Recovers the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage is discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu item can only be selected if you have not yet saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversing command. you can only select this menu item if you have used editing automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, the shortcuts and the default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcuts. you can use this option to modify default shortcuts for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. you can add and remove tool icons for & kpovmodeler with this option; add and remove commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A Bump-Map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic elements are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies. these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel based, by applying an image file as a color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">Using & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can use by clicking on the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a particular file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1181">& Amarok; uses like all other shortcuts. below you can set up a list of shortcuts and their function. you can set up the global key shortcuts by right-clicking in the player window and selecting Global shortcuts. you can set up the key shortcuts by right-clicking in the player window and set shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="1182">You can set up any existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as & Amarok; short commands work. this makes your keyboard a & Amarok; control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts. a sample call for the DCOP function break could look like this:</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kdialog for the user to know why a script is not running.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Corundum' Resale LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most of the scripting languages allow external programs and commands to be executed. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings should be written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore the events even if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure Sets the script to display the setup dialog. to save and load setup data, each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok puts the working folder on the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signals that a new piece is being played. the script could now and zb; with DCOP functions, additional information about the new piece (for example the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Volume Change newVolume signals a change in volume. the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Keeps the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a user-defined menu entry is clicked. to add an entry to the menu, you can use the DCOP feature dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (Submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the signal SIGTERM to the script. this signal should be processed, e.g. storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script management can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the sufficing amarokscript. for this reason, you should correctly name your script packages.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is finished, you can download it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok. for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok, you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to go through endless menus. maybe you're just searching for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have some playlists but can never decide which one you want to listen to? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you. and if the decision is still hard, choose the dynamic mode and the smart playlists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1203">Amarok has excellent support for Apple's iPod, iRivers ifp and many generic USB devices. besides, many different audio systems can be used so YOU can choose how to listen to your music. these and many other useful features make Amarok the most advanced audio player.</seg>
<seg id="1204">Usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake used, you should not have any trouble while compiling. if you encounter problems, please report them in the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options that you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>
<seg id="1207">For some of the compile options, certain dependencies must be fulfilled so that they can be used. see the System Requirements section for details.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Activates debugging symbols. you have the choice between yes, no and full. if you want to help with the development of & Amarok; you should use full.</seg>
<seg id="1209">& Amarok; lets you set up the setup dialog without effort. the setup dialog has several flashcards to set up the different functions of & Amarok;.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Show player windows in addition to the playlist and / or exit the player window. if the option is off, only the playlists window will be displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1214">External browser: lets you choose which browser of & Amarok should be started when a browser is required.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Use other browsers: you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above.</seg>
<seg id="1216">Save Playlist when you exit, automatically stores the current playlist at the end of & Amarok;. enable this option if you don't want to lose the running playlist at the end of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1217">Relative paths to manually saved playlists: when you enable this setting, & Amarok; relative paths to the music files, starting from the location of the playlist, use. otherwise, the absolute position of the music files is stored.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Keep up-to-date play in the play-out causes the playlist to pop up / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">When changing the context browser, automatically changes the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section you can customize & Amarok's appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the font list, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok. by selecting Own scripts, the otherwise gray presented section is enabled. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist windows, player windows, and context browsers. press Select..., so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">By selecting Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and you can set your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selector, which has been activated, for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback when you start, that & Amarok; after the program start, resume playback with the piece at the point where it was stopped at the last end.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The subwindow on-screen display enables you to switch on the OSD. if on-screen display is used, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select the desired font for the OSD from the dialog. the check box shadow causes the text to be shadowed in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection. if your own colors are not activated, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The display text input field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering wildcards the OSD can be adjusted to your own needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinama users, so you can specify which screen of a multi-monitor environment should appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio-output flashcard lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate more settings in this tab card.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection collection is used to set all settings for your collection. this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders, the & Amarok, search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes for setting up how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Search subfolder recursively: this causes & Amarok to search both the critics and their subfolders for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). in addition, an incremental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok to add all playlists found in your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection. the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlist browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup in the MySql subwindow is required.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql device section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under calculator: will enter the computer on which the MySql database is located. then, under port: the network port under which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is made.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data required for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The last.fm card contains the support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current piece if required.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Here you enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Sending off played pieces and updating the profile: this setting enables & Amarok to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Retrieve similar performers: after activating this setting, & Amarok; a list of similar performers to the played piece. you can view the list in the context browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the features and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and otherwise no further KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD presuppose that your window manager considers the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause difficulties for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because these provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developer at bugs.kde.org and also append the file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Usually this is because taglib crashes when reading the meta-info from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for this in & Amarok; is a bit more sophisticated.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of the libraries used by & Amarok are compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib was compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this will result in crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then disable automatic switch off when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or use at least no value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace by e-mail (the e-mail will automatically open in case of a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash, and you send us a good backtrace, the error is guaranteed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-information, but they do not flag as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARGV [0] does not exist" unless -f $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $MP3- &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>
<seg id="1253">This script needs the Perl module MP3:: Mplib. it can be reinstalled with this command: Perl -MCPAN -e'install MP3:: Mplib '</seg>
<seg id="1254">& Amarok; s symbols in the status bar (random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist) are always active in KDE 3.4.0. this is a known bug in KDE 3.4.0. sometimes the symbol effects will be forgotten. adjust the status deactivates to gray and semitransparent. note that in some cases, you must click a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1255">If you get this error: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixERK7Qpixmap, then check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. you can see this with ldd'which catocapp _ _ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any colliding Qt version or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most of the installation problems are most easily solved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help from other users or developers. use the forum and IRC under irc.freenode.net in channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable to seek help. please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok, only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come in there now?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is easy. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1261">To keep the surface intuitively, the Start subwindow has been transformed into the Statistics window. you can find it under Extras Statistics.</seg>
<seg id="1262">The meaning of these symbols has changed with Amarok 1.4 Fast Forward: stars are for evaluation by the user while points are calculated automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1263">To rate pieces, the review column must be displayed in the playlist. click on the title bar of the playlist and select column view rating. click anywhere in the new application column to specify the rating for one piece. you can also use the Windows + [1-5] short commands. this also works if Amarok is in the background.</seg>
<seg id="1264">Select the files you want to remove, and then press Del on your keyboard. or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From Playlist from the drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and let them fall there exactly as you would do with other files. that's how easy it is: -)</seg>
<seg id="1266">In the toolbar of the playlist, next to the Add button, the button playlist is stored. click on it.</seg>
<seg id="1267">Probably the program xmms-config is missing. install the xmms-devel package and install & Amarok; new. look for libvisual, this package contains many very nice visualizations.</seg>

<seg id="1269">No! yes, that's true! no! & Amarok; uses a backend independent approach, therefore the actual question must be: what media types supports GStreamer / xine / Arts / NMM / MAS / KDEM?. as you can see, we support pretty much every imaginable audio format. GStreamer can even decode text and png!</seg>
<seg id="1270">It may! maybe you use Fedora / Red Hat Linux, with which no MP3 decoders are supplied (for patent reasons). the solution: Alt-F2, gg: RedHat mp3 kde, Enter key</seg>
<seg id="1271">Start the YaST online update and install the 'Multimedia Option pack 1'. well... & Amarok; plays MP3's: -)</seg>
<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa-sink, the device must provide a blender. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and at the same time output audio. this can be achieved by using a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the problem cause and a solution. for GStreamer you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. ossesink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just send a MP3 to ALSA, you would just want to hear a white noise. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>
<seg id="1275">XMMS also decodes your data first. GStreamer can print directly to ALSA, just like xine.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Use either the GStreamer driver (really great!) or optimize the settings of Arts. open Control Centre Sound & Multimedia Sound System. enable sound servers with highest priority (real-time priority) and increase the size of the sound buffer (warning, see next point of the FAQ!). make sure that artswrapper SUID is set:</seg>
<seg id="1277">With KDE 3.2.x there are problems with KDEMultimedia codecs that can cause disturbed playback. read this bug report. to enlarge the sound buffer in your ALSA setup file .asoundrc can also help well.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Either do not use the Arts driver, but instead GStreamer or xine, or install KDE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts Codecs (libarts _ mpeglib.so & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="1279">Use a different driver (the xine driver has been heavily optimized for Analyzer), or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound & multimedia, sound system. the smaller the buffer, the less inertia the visualizations. yes, this is a mistake, please help us fix it.</seg>
<seg id="1280">GStreamer is installed, but if I want to switch to the GStreamer driver, crashes and Amarok; why?</seg>
<seg id="1281">After installing GStreamer you have to register all the components. carry out the follow-up register to register all the GStreamer components.</seg>
<seg id="1282">Read the GStreamer FAQ. if that doesn't help, you can also ask IRC channel # GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="1283">Try this (finish Amarok before!): - Download ffmpeg, compile and install it. then run all ffmpeg files in the GStreamer module folder (you will find the module folder with you-config / GStreamer-config) and run it again. start now & Amarok;.</seg>

<seg id="1344">The context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and artist. the context browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and artist.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have previously used earlier versions of & Amarok, you may notice that the bottom-window has fallen away. the information presented there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. furthermore, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras Statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music subwindow displays information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to recreate the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You will find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz symbol. you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To display cover images in context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png formats are supported. the context browser will also display covers images that have either been downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on any of these pieces, it will play immediately.</seg>

<seg id="1354">You can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also right-click it and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script runs, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the lyrics. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok's collection database, no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the lyrics for the running piece (in an external browser window).</seg>

<seg id="1359">Grouping artist / album - First the pieces are sorted by artist and below will be a further distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums will be shown at the beginning of the list under various performers.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping artist / year - Album - sorted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order (the latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>

<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the collection settings. note: & Amarok; will automatically collect your collection once you change something to the selected folder. if you own a lot of pieces, this might take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter right below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. notice how to use this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a drop-down box with which you can filter the most recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to a year.</seg>

<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes the handling of many playlists quite easy. among other things, it also contains smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlist browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok's built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. the smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">You can also add created smart playlists. click Smart playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist. there you can enter all the criteria for your new playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1385">Under the toolbar there is a search area where you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar with which you can get music from an entered URL. if you enter for example tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz, you can access music in the file musi.tar.gz. now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simple dropping. in this case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful: this will automatically insert lost files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all the pieces you want to play. you can change the order by simply drag the entries with the mouse to the desired place. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by whitespace, & Amarok will search for entries containing all the search terms. for example, if you enter one two three, the search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter the OR between the search terms, it is searched for entries containing either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then close the search term with geese feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not for entries like Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: rating: &gt; 50. This is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: - Something looks for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants with each other as you wish. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bath. this is looking for all pieces that either contain Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. the entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. on the left, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist items.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1477">The folder view includes an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the content view is enabled, their content is displayed in the content view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locking and unlocking the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD is selected in folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The headline is a narrow area that is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the headline has no real function, it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can change the key signature to it below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start k3b; setup wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for system administrator (root) when the wizard is started.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work right away. this dialog is meant to personalize and fine-adjust the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality for example can be controlled via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP; functions, you can either use the dcop command line, or the slightly more comfortable program Kdcop. both programs are identical in functionality, so your taste and style of your task is crucial to which of the contributor programs you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume you are using the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP functions, you need to make sure that & k3b; then type something like the following in the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that have all & kde; program in common, supports & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides functions such as copyCD, formatting DVD and other features for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataCDProject () DCOPRef createVideo CDProject () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () DCOPRef createMovixDVD Project () void copyrights () void burncdImage () void burndimage (KURurl) void burndImage (KURurl)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject-method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then a reference to the project by using # dcop k3b K3bProject currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectinterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the above K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void laurl (KURurl, QString Transparent) void addurl (KURurls, QString Transparent) void regurls (Qstring path) void renameItem (Qstring path) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, several folders and then inserts files into the new folders:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT statement / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; reader for & kde;. with it can easily be audio CD; s read and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible depending on the encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders encoding those wav files (compression). currently lame is supported for MP3, oggenc for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First, the title of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (loss-free and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these wav files (usually one per title) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or also to other formats like lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, is being used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this must be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggvorbis (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions but it is probably not necessary to install something yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? chapter Welcher Kodiver gives a small introduction to encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection. in any case, & kaudiocreator; even do not handle the mechanisms of copy protection. simply avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be invoked as often up to a suitable configuration), the daily handling of reading a & CD will be explained later. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble over at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert to many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; fetches information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, with everything being recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is only a short list of the main window commands. for example, there are more information on how this program is used, as well as screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for configuring the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Launches the CDDB request of CD data in accordance with the establishment of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>

<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection with another encoder can be read as the default. it must be noted that the Encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Open the file manager so that an already read file is selected to encode instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (such as logs, picots) for program events (like reading the & CD; finished).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog by & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (like Encoder, for setting the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes tone quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is lost, a lossless audio format is required. in addition to FLAC, there are others like 'shorten' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate, the differences become less important since both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is nevertheless provided with most distributions free of charge, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (at high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG play devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support the MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard' = This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. takes up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate around 5.5. still needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR joint stereo, compression rate around 11 128 kbps for all songs of a song. good enough for music from youths, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality regardless of the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched through the program from the freedb over the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / are used with & kaudiocreator; and the coding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD title to keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs instead of entering the information instead of entering the computer. it must be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator: this means the author) bin not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed. all information can be obtained anyway with a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb it can be used with another (counterfeit) address as the one installed in the system. in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (this can only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which select program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note is that the cdparanoia package needs to be installed from the appropriate distribution first, if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the selected wav files, the encoder and therefore the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the tab to set up the encoder. other encoders can be added on this tab yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoding package needs to be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can get more information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device description of the & CD; / DVD drive, write and reading real on it and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoding of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;). try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. that could give an indication of what is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the cover of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step-by-step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure of what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You have to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can for example be found with a search engine, as it is considered as non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure the / usr / share / cd directory exists and that you have write privileges on it (eg; by trying to copy something with the konqueror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; something that is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each reading & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoder to compress the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change them in any reading of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device identifier is passed to the reader program to read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device identifier of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device designations for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The card general settings. there is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left as shown / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Select only for incomplete information, so you will be informed when information about creating keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The cardboard card CD; settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; download data automatically via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet to access the freedb server while reading the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop down box is simpler, becomes a & CD; entry found, immediately starts reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you later are unhappy with the database entry and the resulting directory names / filenames or tag entries, they can easily be changed. the directory and filename is changed with Konqueror- &gt; tag and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, disable the selection boxes and freedb is not used. however, this is about 620 MB big, consider this twice as this is worthwhile. to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection boxes need to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following card board.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to receive the CD? read the section on freedb. set everything as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the freedb.org page and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, since many firewalls bocken the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80 because the TCP / HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send any & CD; data to the freedb server. disable the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Simply take over the settings from the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously reading pieces: excuse, is there a reason why more than one at the same time with only an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, so simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Discard CD; after reading the last piece: tick this to the & CD; discard at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">Custom folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then the path / folder must be specified in which the wav files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files are created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something with the wav files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything in the same way as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances, something needs to be flipped to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting compression ratio is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags can also be deleted as needed. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change of the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudiocreator; this configuration is used as a standard for any reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it describes how the process of reading the & CD; to the hard drive runs off. we will create and set up MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard drive, was written in the previous section and set up. first, a connection to the internet is established as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb will be retrieved.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a & CD; that is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look slightly different from the data collected for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of retrieving it from the internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try to find the & CD; this example is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not yet done, then the & CD now has to be inserted into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment, the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this only if the & CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, check the FAQ and answers to the Help section or go back to the previous section on the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully obtained from the freedb, all titles of the pieces are already filled and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; gives, a window appears, and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query by freedb (on the page & CD; settings in the dialog for the settings), you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 step 02: the CD Editor - Input of CD data and title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Update title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Update title' unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The bottom comment field can be used for individual comments or individual pieces, the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply collectively for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Note: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb, the CD editor is not empty, it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudiocreator; this option will be set on the encoding settings section; take a look at the 'Core Settings' section.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is apparent with the style of the read-on CD; in this example it is not important since we do not transmit the & CD; for more information go to the web site of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK', go back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The Windows editor window appears again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear when you download the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches on or off the selection of the piece. make sure all the pieces are selected, or press the All Parts button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking the button Select the selection process, this window appears to confirm. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, directly below the toolbar buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to control the orders. the first piece is just read to the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">This error message lets you see if you are trying to work with a coding that you haven't yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the list of orders.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the temporary files and destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The order 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read out and code parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. for low-performance machines, the result is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is encoded in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window appears with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator;, you need & kde; 3.x. resp. 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so it should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; support also support & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed buttons on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop that you can drag in & kde; any MIDI file from a & konqueror; -window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text in MIDI files (reclamation or text events). kmid automatically determines the method used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you exit & kde; during the playing of a song, kmid will start with the same song again next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -window to the & kmid; this works also with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the Play button in the toolbar, select the play from the menu item, or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you drag it to the & kmid; (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows left and right of the template and change the playback speed. to restore the original tempo, double-click the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar appears like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry break in the menu piece, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be stored in one piece of music in two ways. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type will be automatically determined that uses a song, so you don't have to manually adjust the karaoke text. however, you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the entries text events or rectile events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize, which will be played in the series. in this section you can see how to use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the Collection Manager. you can find it in the Collection menu under the point Organize.... Click on New and specify the collection name.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then specifying the name for the new collection.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set each one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When you leave the application, this collection is not saved. remember that when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there, you can add a song to the Add a button. again, the file dialog appears, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not activated, when opening a piece, the temporary collection is activated and emptied. this collection is then added to the still opened pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the row from the submenu selection sequence of the menu collections, the songs will be played in the order they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To jump a song further, select the Next Song button, select next song from the menu item or press the arrow key to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump back a song, select the button Prey piece, the entry Prey piece from the menu piece or press the arrow key to the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter as it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers that are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and thus always sound a trumpet when originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">There are no programs available to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the appropriate file from hand (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all the necessary realizations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except for the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of Keymap"... END Define keymap "Another Keymap"... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section will start (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you can see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are available in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you cannot change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to set all tones that this instrument needs to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot. to do this, enter the following into the PATCHMAP section:</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if now a MIDI file should play a note with patch 127 (gun shot), it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant, where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc.) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are displayed on a specific channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map tones to the percussions channel. see, for example, the provided key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channels, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI to channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel which is mapped to the N channel. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap will be used with the name name for that channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored, which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, this is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then relayed only. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM tells that a keyboard that gets a pitch use event is supposed to play a pitch higher with 4096. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave up. to find the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog, which can be found in the Settings menu, point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has two different views (up to now) to display the played sounds. view the view from the Settings menu under the point Channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the tempo of a song. so if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; so the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to solve the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files individually.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Simply drag and drop. simply open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, make sure to set Automatic Add to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow playback. to restore the standard tempo, double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have on a & kde; desktop a & konqueror; windows with my MIDI-folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a MIDI file) or attached (when I play a karaoke file), I only need to switch to the & konqueror; switch the window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file only once, without adding it to a collection, turn on the Automatic Add to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.M., B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so, set the setup Automatic Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then you decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to program on & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; made of Maacute; laga (Spain). I'm studying mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much time for my hobbies, but I try to make MIDI files, make music and prove phrases.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an enlargement of & kmid, or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">They really make me happy if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. all who send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will contact with friends by & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file already.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and no one gets money from anyone. I would like to stress that I only get more programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>

<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, because the sound quality depends substantially on your sound card. it is not the same whether you are using an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>

<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called andockable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that is only displayed when information is returned in it.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred links under the Bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level. if you select an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the selected entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current play ', TV and permanent playlists can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files. of course, you can only do this if & KMPlayer; not running. the various files in the directory ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer /, can also be changed by an editor, then select from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup, only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing xml files, you have to select a playlist from the Same menu and select either the Edit Mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without matching the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & KMPlayer, some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and modifying [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & KMPlayer; will be aware of the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would fail during the end-animation however, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be displaying a favorite photos: & lt; smild; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; / bodybo.gif "fit =" meet "/ lt; & lt; / bodygt; & lt; / bodysuit; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt; & lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file, such as setting the backend using mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played using the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & KMPlayer; it can even add the special field embed to YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">For the & KMPlayer; to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer; module as service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file Zuordinations of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages concerning the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors here, the Backend Edition is inside & KMPlayer; (view, console, or console from the context menu to check).</seg>
<seg id="1726">So that a given backend is taken for a particular mime type (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manual modification of the ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc file. for example, Phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& KMPlayer; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this needs kxvplayer). before watching TV, the device to be used and the TV channels must be configured. to do this, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog, or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure VDR (Video Data Recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog appears in the settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port. there should be detected ports from which one is selected. the code to be used must be found (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension must be supported for the X server. therefore, the XFree86 server must contain the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config):</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, several names are used by KMPlayer for the sources. at the time of creating this documentation, this dvdnavsource, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrresource.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Is there any hint that I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is a user root to run after plugging the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure / dev / cdrom is shown on the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why must each time my CPU be checked for its performance?</seg>

<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex files, the check search can be very helpful. as soon as a DVI; file is created, skip & drop; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is besides PDF the standard output type of & tex; or & latex;. there are many tools for viewing, converting and printing DVI; files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the check search, the elements of the DVI; file are connected with the editor and as soon as an element is clicked into the DVI; file, the exact opposite is used. as soon as a section is clicked in the & latex; source code is clicked, the corresponding point in the DVI; viewer jumped.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used for working with multiple files. with a master document, working with other .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set on project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the & latex; source is compiled and the result is displayed automatically (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File monitoring: in this mode, the DVI; file is overclocked and no call from & eyepiece; after the fast construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit Toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be noticed. the selection boxes have been developed for the quick inclusion of common elements into the document. the first selection box is for the quick breakdown of the document into sections, chapters, sections,... The available & latex; -commands for the subdivision are:</seg>
<seg id="1770">The Other is for inserting items such as keywords, notes nodes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a term is created for a section, an image, or a different element.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choice of a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; -files can also be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last selection field with the name GrÃ ¶ e is used for the determination of the font size. it can be specified the font sizes for the main text, the joints, etc. the following fonts are available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile; two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document can be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] sets the font name. if the font name is not specified at the beginning, this can also happen later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the simplest way to do this is using the MenÃ ¼ s Building or the Button Fastening.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved prior to compile. & Kile; does the storage automatically execute.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If you fail to compile the document, you should search for errors in the recording. when using fast construction & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, logging in should also be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font. the command\\ started {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} necessitates the alteration of the font.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are supervised only within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end}. there is no restriction (number) for the changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, grease pressure, italics pressure, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands can either end with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a phrase can be displayed italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and concludes with\\ end {quota}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text is presented with the & latex mask, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & box;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, a few adjustments should be made to improve the readability of the document. for this purpose, mind. a quote, a few positions in the fat and italics pressure and a poem can be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor-View or Ctrl-E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). with an external viewer the window has to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file was created, the document can be printed out or converted into a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I nape). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th Step - after clicking on DVI - the document can then be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar enables the conversion of the DVI file into other formats. once the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source code was created, the conversion into desired other formats can begin by means of the knobs in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The pre-search feature allows the direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; offers a corresponding setting for all and latex; -binaries. for this purpose only Modern must be set up under Settings Kile... Tools can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to execute the default search, the mouse pointer must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on the preview search. the jump to the appropriate place in the DVI; viewer is then taken.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece; with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the appropriate & latex; open and jump to the appropriate line. for this purpose & box; in & eyepiece; set as text editor (configure the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using the & DVI file system, there may be an error. if there is an error, this will be shown in the log file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The log file executes the source code of the source code. in the editor, then the buttons of the LaTeX error and the default LaTeX error can be used for jumps between the errors. to view the faulty line, click on the error in logging and & Kile; jump to the defective line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">When clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will pop up to select the template to use for the document. the pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can be rewritten either from scratch or used to quickly create a new document. further information can be found in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">HÃ ¤ufige users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be placed in & Kile; created, saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file is opened or a new file is created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by means of a file New, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings Kile... Settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are substituted by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering into document class. typically it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document was created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, you can select your own template instead of the standard ones.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any and latex; files created easily for creating a template, should be searched for one on the Internet and carried through the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about it and its possibilities the manual of Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with the reading of the chapter work with the editor of & kate.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very convenient & latex; command reference that can be called via the MenÃ ¼ TTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of almost all commands that can be found in & latex, as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with a pressed Ctrl key to select the & tex; this means that clicking on\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with a pressed shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search for different kinds of source texts and to highlight them. for example, the & latex; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can collect additional jump marks. these are a separate type of bookmark within the text. the menu items Edit Jump marks or the respective keys allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. thereby, this jump mark is also highlighted so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like & Kile;. although & kate; features already excellent possibilities, were added into & Kile; used always many environments and groups and therefore supported & Kile; special commands for their selection. under Edit Settings, the following commands are included for selecting the text:</seg>
<seg id="1817">Contains a complete paragraph (group of rows containing an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source text. the only exploiting thing in & Kile; is that the abscings are separated by two blank lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">The word is selected under the current cursor position. this selection also has an expanded meaning since this command also contains & latex; -commands with a back screened (\\) and an additional star (*) at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, it can be removed first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the key Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; offers with own commands here for a faster possibility. under Edit Remove the following commands to delete the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Removes a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit select paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for more orders under Edit environment for a possible easy work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumps to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is located before or within the\\ begin {environment} command, it will jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overviews can be lost quickly. this command completes the last opened environment, so that the nested environment is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that correspond to those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">This command will jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is).</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command is used to jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the padlock.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is in front or behind the welded bracket of a & tex; -group #, the group will jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">With the input of many nested braided groups-brackets you can quickly lose the view above. this command completes the last opened group so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>

<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment by command\\ begin {environment}, & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and, fortunately, the completion list increases. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions will be removed by selecting a command. alternatively, a jump to these positions can be added, so that a jump to these positions can be possible and the desired parameters can be entered.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Completely you can make adjustments to these lists. you can select various wifes for & tex; - and & latex; -commands as well as wipes of the general language used.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. it must always be entered a few letters with\\ begin and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of ambient conditions. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for the completion of environments available.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When calling the completion mode above the volume editing environment or the key / key Alt + Shift key, the command to open the environment is automatically filed and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient capacity can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & kile; realize that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the list of completion mode for & tex; - and & latex; -commands.</seg>

<seg id="1916">The version 3.2 by & quantaplus; contains many new & XML; tools and functions. these tools are unique in their integration into & quantaplus; all these tools use Komi as a surface and libxml2 and libxslt as underlay. the combination results in fast, efficient, complete and productive tools.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Anyone who has worked with the & kde; documentation has known myproc and how outstanding it is. if we take it a bit, we give it a graphical interface! no more relies on a terminal; simply clicked the icon for the XML processor and done!</seg>
<seg id="1918">This application expects a index.docbook in the folder. if index.docbook is in the earnest working folder, then leave the current working folder clicked. if not, remove the current working folder and specify the folder in the field of other folders.</seg>
<seg id="1919">Output files are stored in the same folder as the source files. all previous & HTML; files are deleted every time myproc is started.</seg>
<seg id="1920">As I have said before, anyone who has already worked at the & kde knows how helpful this application is. and with & quantaplus, there is now a great graphical interface for it.</seg>
<seg id="1921">If the currently opened file index.docbook, simply select the current working folder. if not, select the current job folder and enter the folder where index.docbook is found.</seg>
<seg id="1922">When it comes to an output on the screen, its file is flawed. please check the bugs reported and try again.</seg>
<seg id="1923">If the file to be checked is already marked in & quantaplus, then the current file is simply clicked. if not, delete the checkbox in the current file and select the file to be checked by another file - file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1924">If you only want to know if the file well-formed is formed, click the Well-formed check selection.</seg>
<seg id="1925">To use a & DTD; specified in the & XML; file specified, select & DTD; (External) and enter the location of the & DTD; (External) and enter the location of the & DTD; by definition-URI; file selection. both for the & W3C; & XML; schema as well as for the RelaxNG review is required in the file selection.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Yes, & quantaplus; also has one & XSL; processing tool! this uses the xsltproc tool from the libxml2 library.</seg>
<seg id="1927">If the file to be processed is already selected in & quantaplus, then the current file is simply selected. if not, remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection file.</seg>
<seg id="1928">Type the name of the file as the result should have named, and the file is usually stored in its home folder.</seg>
<seg id="1929">The plug-ins, the & quantaplus, have with & quantaplus; even possibly little to do. this makes the plug-in system very powerful. you can benefit from the additional functionality right away and don't have to wait for someone to use the plugin in & quantaplus. read more about it below.</seg>
<seg id="1930">To install a plugin or a part, we start editing plugins. this will open the following dialog:</seg>
<seg id="1931">This dialog enables you to manage all of the included plugins and add new ones. we describe each & GUI; element in:</seg>
<seg id="1932">Here you can enter the search path. when adding plug-ins without a location, & quantaplus. this path to search the plug-in.</seg>
<seg id="1933">Many people often work on a project in a sort of hierarchical relationship. & quantaplus; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift; F7 Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the user's nickname and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">A member may have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the Setze + button. the currently selected member (her identity) appears fat after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of one's own identity are important with regard to news and comments. see for further information on annotations.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of your team, there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something specific happens. see for more information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project. an example would be recording the opening and closing of the project, so that later can be seen how much someone worked on it, or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that takes a file into CVS, once it is added to the project & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1940">Events can be created, edited and deleted on the event configuration of the Shift; F7 Project Project Properties dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1941">An EMail will be sent to the addressee selected in the recipient list. the addressee can be a team or sub-project leader.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Comments are special comments in the documents. they differ from normal comments by following things:</seg>
<seg id="1943">Input Notes is simple. it can either be selected from the editor context menu or the @ annotation keyword in a comment area followed by comment text.</seg>
<seg id="1944">In this case, the syntax is @ annotation (nickname) or @ annotation (role), whereby nickname is the chosen nickname of the team member, role play a role in the project from the following possibilities: team leader Subproject leader In the area and sub-project leaders, the respective area or sub-project names should be given, as in the following examples below.</seg>
<seg id="1945">Nicknames and roles names are case-sensitive, but whitespace around the brackets and the: make the note invalid.</seg>
<seg id="1946">& quantaplus; is a development environment for scripting and formatting languages, which is DTD-agnostic and supports web-based formatting and scripting languages.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The settings can be reached via the Settings menu. here only via & quantaplus; -specific settings are treated, a short description for the others can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="1948">Settings can be set up by setting Quanta. this dialog extends over a few pages that are treated one after the other.</seg>
<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; with regard to tags including car completion, this can be modified.</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lower case-case of tags: large / lower case case of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lower case-case means that tags are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Uppercase / lowercase of attributes: large / lower case-case of automatically added attributes. normal size / lower case-case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as they are described in the tagXML files.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Optional tags automatically close: if checked, it will be added to tags for which the closing tag is optional.</seg>
<seg id="1953">Do not include optional tags automatically: as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Automatically update start and finish day: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic replacement of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters into the corresponding coding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: mimetypes for detection of different types of files. using the Default button, the default settings can be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard character encoding: the encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening opened files (where the encoding of the file can be skipped).</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD is used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been detected. however, this setting is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Create a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates backup copies regularly, so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file.</seg>
<seg id="1960">Previewing and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in one's own view (or the documentation in a tab), making it possible to preview the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1961">Reset the window settings to the default on the next start is useful when the user interface has changed by changing the MDI modes and andocking / appending views. it corresponds to the --resetext command line parameter.</seg>
<seg id="1962">The warning section is used to control the display of warnings by stop-stop warning.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The place to change behavior of & VPL; to change it. it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts, as well as the synchronization behavior of the VPL- and source code view in shared mode. see the different modes.</seg>
<seg id="1964">Here the parser and the structure tree, representing the representation of the parser nodes in the document, can be set into details.</seg>
<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the Structural Settings section, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the refresh frequency of the tree while editing and how deep in a change of the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty knots are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such in which no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifclause abbreviation means something else than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are part-applications from third side, which can be re-used by any part-enabled application, the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not in a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load a component in "read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load. only-read-Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus. if the plugin is correct, select it even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should later be installed.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, troubleshooting was completely redeveloped. support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented which allows different implementations of plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, supporting the use of & gued; inquantaplus; Inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the Debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger-Plugin dropdown box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is activated for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view that displays the contents of monitored variables. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all stops are listed, with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view shown in the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger. normally appears in the bottom dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported features of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action the connection to the debugger, if necessary, is made, or it divides the plug-in to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it is not necessary to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to debugging session Started the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug-request. this is equivalent to the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and running information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, execution will be continued. if the script is started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens while a script is stopped, execution continues. if it happens before a request is made, the execution starts as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The debugger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include it is properly purged.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to skip the statement and go to the next as if there is not the current one.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">This dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value of a variable.</seg>
<seg id="1991">& kxsl; is a work by Keith Isdale and this part of the documentation. & kxsl; is a & kde; front end and a part of xsldbg that they can find on http: / / xsldbg.sf.net with many more works of Keith.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus. they enable & quantaplus; their simplicity and flexibility makes of & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility makes of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s exist in two ways, family 1, the markup languages and family 2, the Script languages and / CSS;. & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and the toolbars. tag Archives contain two file types, which include text and instructions faster in a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details on conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool boxes. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars allow for fast inserting of tags into a document without the risk of a writer.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag Folders are not as folders. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag Folders carry the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better look and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a TagXML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but element type over itself otherwise nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for the day type class. the name of the base class for this class. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the Type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (family 2 only)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (family 1 only)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. additionally, there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be displayed & etc; This is a type element only element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Prints the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus; used to achieve the source of the data.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, a interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag grouping the elements of a list together. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can only occur once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each attribute; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each element; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with a & XML; -declarations start: & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces influence nothing, but look at & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & amp;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and lt; text &gt; will not cause a break, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the tools dialogue at the top of the & quantaplus; to start and check TagXML. an additional dialog will appear, with simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This function is currently not currently available. currently, the check is performed only when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file a & PHP; overloading feature is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "error" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "option" / &gt; & lt; tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for using DTD editing DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; for a newly created & descriptionrc; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[General] Version = Reverse 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional). if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... created. click New Action will result in the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">This action assigned shortcuts. by clicking the user defined button you can assign a shortcut; with KON the current shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that will change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples of & quantaplus; even the Quick Start Dialogue or the various See in... actions for the (X) HTML-DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be given. example: SH / home / myhome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in the command line, like sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. On this way try & quantaplus: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variable that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we will be replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with PID the current & quantaplus; if by & quantaplus; only one instance runs, the text will be added to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; used by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the above methods, a script input from & quantaplus can be used. in the input field, input can be determined what is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected section of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, which should be specified with the text written on the standard output, by setting the value to the output drop:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create an own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the pop-up.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the matching toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you are planning to use it, enable dialog "Edit Tag" when available to allow an input when using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action associated with that symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, chart Additional programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually regarded as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or should at least be signaled a message to the user that clicking this symbol is a & lt; start; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it must still be associated with the action. this happens via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. in addition to the text field there is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the saved symbol is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags as there are some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (on the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the element that is to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like a quick way to access the Konqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar can believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by using all the symbols to make sure everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">After realeXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust its & descriptionrc; so that its toolbar (s) is loaded (will be) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most popular extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second we handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in main index Top element = Your description for these documentations e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html section 2 = Section1.html tag 2 = tag1.html tag2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see now in the & PHP; documentation:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax syntax...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the box depth (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but look at & lt; notes. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file, which serves to shape the context-sensitive help. for example, if writing a & PHP; script to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. there are only two types of entries here: the context List (ContextList) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of separate context elements to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / quanta / doc for local or global use.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worth sharing, send your docrc files with a description of important information, for example which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; community. you will not be rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the lost resources (DTEP packets, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places there is an Email menu item, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, send tool bar tool bar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the Scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all others & quantaplus; users can download them. to contribute to this, we recommend signing the resources to what it requires a GPG / PGP key. this ensures the origin of the resources, both for our team as well as for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you are asked for your private gpg key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New Resource dialog, you will need to fill out the input fields (URL preview can remain empty) and start uploading with clicking OK.</seg>
<seg id="2074">The Upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD File menu (DTEP), upload tool bar tool bar, and start the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus. in case of problems it warns and it can then be broken down. in case of problems it warns and it can then be broken down. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a notification appears with the specification of the resource of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus. however, creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files may be needed in tagXML format. there is the easier way to convert DTD automatically into a DTEP package.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD File menu and the conversion of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD Description which should be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">Doctype Definitions line: the string that appears in! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; adapted. it is recommended to use this possibility.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. to understand this and to be able to draw full benefit from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the workspace is divided into three areas: global, locally and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. everything that is marked globally is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbar, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user's directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are available only within a particular project. this can be all from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most constrained size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the sharing of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the construction views, the tabs with information and the tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Right-click the tabs to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all of the tabs, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jumping to a bookmark or executing CVS instructions to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right click in the Editor area will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / copy / paste / paste), edit the tags under the mouse cursor or open the file when the string is called a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional acts as a standard for which a set of tool bars is shown. in the course of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the tool bars are adapted to the new functions and related user requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; insert into your document, then click the icon representing the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog box for different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The building views (QIT;) enable you to navigate in the information to & quantaplus; to navigate, open and roam. in the display with tabs, files, project, pattern templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation are available.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project management is a powerful tool called & quantaplus. this view shows all files in the project and allows the management of files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from storage media can be performed with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">A further possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc; there are all possibilities open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. the category depends on & quantaplus. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the respective user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button, you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">With this view, the internal structure of the active document is displayed. by clicking an element the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by right-clicking an item opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. it can quickly alter attributes and namespaces. the content-oriented entry system allows the change of all available attributes with few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add project-specific documentation, edit and be viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window, which can be accessed through the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts executed, give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the tool bar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an EMail, they can secure and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus; autoconf has a number of options passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting with & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH in front of your bin folder. the same applies for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">During the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to occupy himself with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus? well, this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer restricted to pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Now, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole & kde; developer community is based. & quantaplus; following, in good use of free software, the idea of Why develop what someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, & quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by means of self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation can increase dramatically.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly expanded to a mature editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">For more detailed documentation, help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or execute khelpcenter help: / quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffeur Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not on it, the oldest entry is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and entire files as templates for later use. see the section on Templates. if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project folder folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converted when inserting from the clipboard there included special characters for & HTML; write, so that they are displayed correctly and not be misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; -Description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s is. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor tag.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches or outputs the block selection. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go straight to a line number. this is very useful when your & PHP; script outputs error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expression to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you can see the display of script actions and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Start and turn on the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus. main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as one changes to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the symbol column on the left of the main window. this column allows you to place bookmarks with a click of a mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu together with the entries Prey or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog to insert files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows for example to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Upload the files in your project to the server. the list of available transportation methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings such as & quantaplus; the project manages. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Load a project tool bar. these are stored in project you / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. actions only need to specify the name. actions must be saved by setting actions... Settings. tool bars are stored on toolbars toolbar, or you will be asked when you exit, whether you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a tool bar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the tool bar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team in order for the toolbar to be present in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the uploading of tool bars to the main server, where everyone can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Invite one & DTD; who has made you or anyone else and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and a write permission in the global KDE folder is not present, the store will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbars. if the default (HTML) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current day settings dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activated or deactivated the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus. the insertion is denied by means of a tool bar if that day contradicts the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the Plugins menu, the available plugins are listed under the menu items mentioned above. click on them. click an activated plug-in deactivates it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of highlighting schemes depends on the type; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line ending. very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Verifies the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Instant switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in KDE libraries, changeover can sometimes need time or unnice graphics. recommended is the flashcard mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu contains an entry for each open subwindow. when selecting an entry, the corresponding subwindow will be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Switches the display of the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window on or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">Changes in this dialog affects any application using the KHTML-part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Displays the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears in which you can delete entries from the toolbar, or add which can be added and the sequences can change.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor, but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after filling the project name, the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering name, file is filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can specify the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the selected log will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and by default templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and by default toolbars. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to include files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Allow if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be attached. if a project is started from scratch, do not stop.</seg>
<seg id="2165">This option displays all files and folders within the main folder and you can make a precise choice of manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clips out of the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub-window profile or changed using the Shift; F7 key shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders are possible), which are ignored in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, also files listed in .cvsignore are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This way the desired debugger can be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger Plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the bottom-window profiles, high loading profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile, by pointing out its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration dialog, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn event actions and add, change or delete events. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as saving a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus, the last project opened, cannot be influenced at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project or Project Icon Project open from the toolbar. the dialog Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & Quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders will behave as well, but the entries are missing and opening with... in the context menu available with the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removing the current profile. if there is only one profile available, the button will be dazzled to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by programmers. this option is useful when frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk save option does not come into question.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or just leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus; many high-load profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not have to be changed, except the network administrator does not run a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your fear threshold, this is either a time-saving function or a risk. use them at your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it can't be read easily, but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only a set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be stored, opened or deleted from the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar Project Toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has the most to do. this helps not only increase productivity, but also allows adaptation of & quantaplus; to the own way of working.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars in & quantaplus are best discussed. use and addition differ. the addition of tool bars is treated at the bottom in the addition of tool bars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols can be set either using the context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, other actions can be removed such as toolbar, rename tool bar or set toolbars to indicate which actions on this or other toolbar are to be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action toolbar, the entries will be removed and action processed which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can set up toolbar buttons in the Settings menu... and set Settings... set.</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are basically document skeletons, code cutlets and files to link. & quantaplus. you can copy, move or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in example the limitations you imagine for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. further information on the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents can be created in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organizes the work in the appropriate way to be efficient. see in for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text area should always be inserted in the documents. you can include everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl base.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for entire websites. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;.) and select File As a template Save as local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, you will notice that (even if it is saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As a template save selection as local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file only to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the tree or project files, you can click on a folder on the right and create site template, enter a name for the template and secure. by default, it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be stored as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates provide a very goal-oriented approach. you can make headlines and footers, or dynamic with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things while using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files laid in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is equivalent to one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three types described above; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled once elterly attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set so it would disable templates in this path, except they would be explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or reproduced text for templates in this folder. this could be common headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy all templates to a folder with special headers / footers for a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (show the right mouse button) via a full command collection to add folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; -Editor and VPL; & source code editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second one splits the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source code editor if necessary, in which the changes made in the VPL; editor in the source code are visible.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor in a document containing & PHP, a small green symbol shows the default of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; to edit and PHP; there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works exactly like the first one, except that at the same time the changes are visible both in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor synchronously. pressing F9 is enabled, this mode is already active, the key press moves the active cursor from one window to another, while maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is adjustable by settings Quanta. when selecting VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation: a small range for fast machines and a large range for slow computers.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Suppose you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select the title of the website, so the editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL; editor is possible. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; this is used to reduce the manual encoding. this allows you to change the following:</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the merge and merge of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently from each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the result expected. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge entire folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; for folder merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white characters and tabs are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column at the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is the same, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">The opening dialog enables manual typing of file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog will remember your selection and displays it again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files will be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Via the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, for B and C, however, a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to immediately set an output file. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the open dialog, you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">Sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you'd first need to create two corresponding files, load them into & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, paste, and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at this time you can do nothing & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window will be supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, leave the mouse over the line for a while. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these default settings can be changed via the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">If a difference is detected, the color indicates which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. that is in the next section (merging) well to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line dividing the abstraction column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file does not have lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is rendered to dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the reference windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Gealters] if you have edited the result. usually, it contains text by automatically merging text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe button to find next solved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts).</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparison bars are used, any difference at the same time is also a conflict that has to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be highlighted in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows, where the beginning of the group otherwise would not be visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current pane and each on the left appears a black beam.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, through automatic merging or manual editing, no more line is left in the group; then in these lines the text & lt; no line in the queue; displayed. this is only a placeholder for the case that you may change your mind and maybe again select another source. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a selection you might copy and insert somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; conflicts of merge; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if selecting the sources ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with scroll bars and mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-start and string end, Siw as you are used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the display window, you can also use the other buttons for editing. with the Insert key, you can switch between insertion and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation which allows you to skip to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-above) to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-click Move / Ctrl-Image Abroad) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the pointer to the clipboard, you must copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-paste). there is also the option option automatically copy. if this is checked, whatever you mark, is automatically copied to the clipboard and the manual copying is omitted. be careful with this option, because you may accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors are using a newline\\ r\, and Win32-based systems use cart recirculation + newline feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also not using binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of recently used files will be saved automatically at the end of the game and restored at the next start. (menu Settings- &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">(on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you enable this option, differences will be displayed in italic script. if the font selected does not support this representation, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be rendered straight. on these systems, the button presets automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, pressing the tab key will insert the corresponding number of spaces. otherwise a tab character will be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press enter or return, the indentation of the preceding line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">When this option is checked, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. copying the manual to the clipboard is omitted then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line end type you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, try & kdiff3; first, to find all the completely identical lines in the source files. only during this first step, white characters can be ignored. in this step white characters are not ignored. even when merging white marks are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a cart track\\ r 'and a newsprint'\ 'at the end of a line, others save only a newsprint'\ ', but then files with different sizes may look identical in the page-to-side comparison, but if this option is enabled, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default, this option is deactivated. in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default, this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely search for even smaller differences. the option is activated by default. it is effective in complex and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white characters are less important in many files. if you need this only from time to time, then use better the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on how to scan folders and execute a merge. look for details under Documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already an older version exists, the original version is appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it is deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need & kdiff3; quit and reboot for the change to be active. (this option is in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The code for encoding results in a short notice of what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. since the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define pre-processing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can set the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this to suppress highlighting of changes in white characters in text or overview columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are shown in a color coded transitions column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selection of A & lt; & gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C is displayed next to the normal still a second oversee column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply fill out the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. the current file merge in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can use your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. you can use this function e.g. for cutting out annoying parts or for correcting the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is used for the input of this command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program this themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this command for line synchronization to convert the input into capital letters: SED's\\\ (\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically insert character strings generated (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword produced text $. you can change the list as needed.\\ before $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in feature in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line matching. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every Sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, thus quasi-deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can use something else, e.g. perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / ZIP. however, perl needs only a few details. where sed\\ (and\\) needs, perl needs only (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal pre-processor are maintained for display and merging. further operations only change the data that the newline algorithm algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal pre-processor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may inadvertently notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers have to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folder recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object; you can adjust the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate the merging and displays the simulated changes without realising it.</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging single files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, folder 1 is used as a base. if no destination folder is specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts, not the merging. to start the merging, you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F7 key. (more details will follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folders, a small message window will inform you of the current progress. if you cancel the scanning of the folders, only the files that have been compared up to that date will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folders is finished, & kdiff3; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">You can open a folder by clicking on the + / -, or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys to the left / right. the directory menu contains two functions spoilers and all subdirectories where you can open or fold up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the file comparison will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The symbol in column name reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the A / B / C column and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merging is started, you will be informed about problems of this kind again.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries the color is also identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical when their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. in folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea for this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf that is only green, then yellow becomes yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copying B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copy C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy of A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such faulty objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The Synchronization mode is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified, and if the option synchronizes directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible filename for the output file only B; copied directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file instead of merging (unsafe) is enabled, then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange such errors are not eliminated, merging the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is processed after the other. you state-column displays completed if the merge was successful, and according to other messages when something unexpected happened. if merging is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">When in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display other columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only indicated when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (File or Odner), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merging actions (also in all subfolders), you can start merging.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you don't have a destination folder, then C is used as destination in the three-folder merging mode. B is selected as the target when merging two-folder merging, and when synchronizing A and / or B is used as destination.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the directory menu or press F7 (the shortcut). in order to merge only the current entry, select Run the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merging actions by conflicting file types, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">If you merge all entries, a dialog box will appear with options, simulate and cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Choose Simulations if you want to see what would happen without the actual changes made. you will then receive a complete list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window will open (note the screenshot of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select start / continue the directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved it, a corresponding dialog will appear. then & kdiff3; his work will continue with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">When & kdiff3; to make a mistake, a message and detailed status information appears. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. so you have the option to try another action for the entry or to solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, note & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) and will not merge them together again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered finished. only when you change the merge operation, these entries will be merged.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (setup menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3...) now has a section called directory merging with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files matching the given pattern will be displayed in the element tree. you can enter several patterns. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders do not have to match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern will not appear in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as a separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this folder can be specifically configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hidden attribute. in other file systems, a preceding point marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files should be displayed in the Elemental Tree or not. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">For links to files: when the option is turned off, symbolic links will be compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is turned on, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated as normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not responding to possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link to itself would lead to an endless loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of resolved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files that contain no text. (specify a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it may be quicker to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to confidentiality the modification date. there is no real comparison. the files will be considered identical if they are equal. this may, for example, be useful when copying the modified date. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Activates Synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder was specified. in this mode, the merge suggestions are selected to be identical to both folders. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, instead of merging it is suggested to copy the newer file as an action. (this is considered unsafe because it assumes the knowledge that the other file has not been modified.) This option is disabled in the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version is renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file already exists with the .orig extension, this will also affect the normal merging of individual files, not just merging entire folders. this option is enabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view will remain visible during merging individual files; you can shift the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want this, you can switch the folder & text window in the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by alternating between the directory and the text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to compare a file simply by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. to do so, the status will be returned to completion and the file will not be merged even if you start the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status is lost if you re-read the directory again: directory -Menu: re-read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way you can specify files and folders for opening, located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file with one on an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. you should note a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters must be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, whitespace &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or you can't tell if a link to a file or folder shows. then a file is always accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or modification date. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviates from the original. (note the option Confidential of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP first always starts the built-in difference viewer. to start KDiff3, press the right mouse button above the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. if it is used as a part, & kdiff3; assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then, & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch will start to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In Konqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview - KDiff3Part from the context menu. note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. the merging or comparing of folders is not supported in the part mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools with the name KDiff and KDiff2 (now hot compactors) already exist. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff3 from the Diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or going to do it like that.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from sources and probably didn't tell the correct prefix to KDE. in the default configure installed in / usr / local, but then KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines will be treated as identical; if only a non-white character is different, the line will not be treated as identical.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor is aware of any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this is necessary to easily resolve a conflict by clicking in the source code and selecting the button A / B / C. this important information is lost if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is too much effort to create an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. in order to edit large amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, suddenly lt; No src has been set; appeared and the text cannot be deleted. what does that mean and how can that be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and missed the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found at http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. nevertheless, if difficulties occur, please report on the & kde; -mailing lists of it.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift-Remove) copy to the clipboard and delete the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift) inserts the text from the clipboard at the current cursor position or replaces the current mark.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current program version, you need to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder doesn't already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the lettering A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the rows from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already present).</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. underscores in single characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; displays a mini preview of all virtual desktop spaces. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the workspace, change their size, finish them or move them. this works in both a desktop and several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual workspaces as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button you can move windows inside & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop as well as on other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager; clicked, the context menu has only the two entries Pager to set up... and exit. if, however, on an application within & Kpager; clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimize, Maximize, On Desktop and Finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows inside the & Kpager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other working areas.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is checked, the name of the virtual desktops is displayed in the & kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager; display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is intersected with name, the names are provided with atomic numbers, eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">When this box is checked, the background of each desktop is displayed as background in the & Kpager; displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this box is checked, the current programs are displayed as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only the empty workspaces are displayed to enable them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply displays simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon displays the windows with its default icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically leaves & kpager; in a 2xN grid, all virtual workspaces appear in a horizontal and vertical line in a vertical line, which is very well suited for display sideways on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, which can display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents. furthermore, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">At the moment this can not be changed in the Settings dialog. you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vi.If you do not have a write permission for the file, you must log in as user root or turn to your system administrator. in this file you must enter the key windowbanner mode and assign it to this value. possible values are:</seg>
<seg id="2467">Since & Kpager is part of the kdebase package, you will need a working installation of the KDE Basic packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded to include new functions. it is optimized for use on high performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you want to start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of the screen shows the magnified area of the screen. in the following, this window is called a magnification window. the picture shown in the magnification window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In the default setting, & kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a moving magnifier. alternatively you can & kmag; to do this, set a selected screen area in the magnifier window (select window) or the environment of the mouse cursor at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse pointer is displayed in the enlarged window, select the setting mouse pointer. please note that the mouse pointer is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the standard node; / Qt; mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the drop-down mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor in the magnifier window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the content of the magnifier window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In addition, press the & Shift key or press the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the upper left corner of the selection window stays fixed and only the lower right corner is to move.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Starts or stops the updating of the display. stopping the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Gering, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a select window will be displayed. the selected area will be displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulate a mouse click, as soon as the mouse pointer remains in the same place for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and which every mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can bypass the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, pain caused by the use of your computer may also be caused by a doctor if this is not done yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To make it clear: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by mouse click, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result may be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and takes a mouse click away as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the smart move activates, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way you can drag the drag with pressed mouse button. the smart move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Smart Forward is turned on, the turntable setting time (1 / 10 s) becomes active. here the time is set, the & kmousetool is waiting, before releasing the mouse button, before releasing the mouse button again, if no moving of the mouse occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports the click by mouse shift. if this function activates, a slow moving to the right and back leads to a double click. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double-click. these moves are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt when & kmousetool; the first time it is started, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can move & kde; move to the & kcontrolcenter; go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and click here the tab General. there's a slider sound buffer, which you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool; started at every start of & kde; this function is currently only available under & kde; for GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically there.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values that were set when opening the dialog. if you have already pressed the user button, the settings will be reset to the status after the last press hit.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The best thing is to use & kmousetool; first with the default settings. in particular, the smart move should be turned off. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later accept the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First of all, you should be aware of where a mouseclick remains without effect: clicking on the neutral parts of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link will not result in unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you don't just clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First of all you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. but it should be clear when you look at the bottom of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the rollers. these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily scratch with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you are using the smart move, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use a different window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; to continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to a different location.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but use the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop if you want to make a keyboard input. thus, a accidently moving mouse cursor can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart move, but I don't manage to edit lyrics.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced feature of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very probably possible to copy text, copy it into the clipboard, or run any other action you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. however, it will probably only cause problems. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select a mouse click on the one end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the mouse cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouseclick. this will each time, when & kmousetool; the mouse button hits a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when when shifting the sliding time. later, you can also use the smart move without the audible mouseclick. but that requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the XTest Expansion for & X Window needs to be installed. this should already be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse click is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers, and these are set up correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; activates the mouse button as soon as the mouse pointer is short. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and causing pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to allow a certain time to start a pulling process before releasing the mouse button. in this way, drag and drop can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for the word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words. in addition, you can reconcile the wordlists with an OpenOffice.org dictionary, so that only correctly spelled words are included in the word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screen shot) and a memory of the already spoken propositions (the upper white field in the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">You can enter the sentences that you want to hear in the input field. each spoken sentence is appended to the memory memory. you can select phrases that are to be spoken again.</seg>
<seg id="2537">With the Settings kmouth menu entry, set up... open the Settings dialog from & kmouth; this dialog contains two flashcards, voice output and settings, the page word completion as well as the KTTSD language service page.</seg>

<seg id="2552">The main area of the window to edit text passages is divided into two. in the upper part, the text passages are displayed as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part you can edit a selected entry. if you have selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the corresponding shortcut. if you have selected a text passage book, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">You can either add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books, either by selecting from the menu bar, toolbar, or via a drop-down menu.</seg>
<seg id="2555">You can change the order of text passages or text passages by dragging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the & Alt; key.</seg>

<seg id="2625">Messages have the highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you leave & eg; a long text on a web page, you can begin with & kmouth; messages are also news.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text jobs. every order you use from the debit card is a text assignment. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text jobs. text jobs are intended for the output of longer texts that have no particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are processed in queues, except the output of screen readers. when an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktats; just reading such, this output will pause and stop.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there are still further types of filters available.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String substitutes replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktats; is provided with predefined string creation filters that allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; Transformer use a XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from a format to another format. included in the scope of supply; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speech selection filters, you can send orders depending on the content of the text, or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktats. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules according to which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, the text will remain unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; message is sent, it is processed by all activated filters created on the bottom of the page. processing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed in series from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs will be shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You must enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern for the setup of string enforcement filters. if these patterns are found in the text, the text is exchanged for the related substitution text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can select this name as you like, it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column. the list is executed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is applied only if the speaker speaks for the text assignment one of the languages registered here. click the button to view a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; key pressed.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID running programs get you with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432, you may only enter copete.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string release filter is only applied to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filters when matching. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">In comparison to words, the string release filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. thus, the words must be limited by delimiters (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions. however, if you have the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it in the dialog Add or Edit as help to assemble these terms.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer Transformer & XML; with the help of XSLT files from a format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is available through the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The speech selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the card board speaker or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that texts should be read by kmail from a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktats; if a text is passed to the filter, it is looking for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected based on the speaker properties that the program sends the text to & ktats, and the characteristics of the speakers set up on the card board are selected.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the specified regular expression. is on your system the & kde; -Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call it by clicking on the button to get help in entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want to use. if the text fulfils the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected to match the required requirements. click the button on the right to see the dialogue of speakers.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speech selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Diesen filter if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>

<seg id="2681">Before you use your speech synthesizer, first check if you are using speech synthesizers. you can use the shell script spd-conf to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktats; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktats; which uses the speech speech tool. the kttmsgr utility should be developed in such a way that it is possible to set up speech by speech-dispatcher and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to highlight text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also marks for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supports & ktats; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British Male) since this is the default voice, the festival is used in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog do not set 100%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and set level detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs divide text into individual sentences. this means that only the first set needs to be synthesized, not the whole text order.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the set level detection filters. at the first start of & ktats; a set limit detection filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add further bylaws filter filters, but beginners will be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to select the speaker is to select the speaker's selection. turn on the language selection and enter text to read. switch on the box menu assignments, which speaker & ktats; select some properties and check how the speaker is selected, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktats; then faster to start reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole block of text, which can take a long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text assignments on the card board, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set level detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. do not change anything in this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set Level detection filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and add a tabulator sign (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering).</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen reavers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the default delimitation filter from default, you can paste it again by loading the included file standard _ sbdrc.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the card selection panel, you can override the Speaker Settings for the application.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the top on the card board speaker). in other words: no speech properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most appropriate speaker, which has all the characteristics of a speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & act; select this speaker. otherwise select & ktv; the speaker closest to the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired language characteristics by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select here the characteristics of the desired speaker. if this property does not play a role, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to have precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this feature. the only case where you might want to specify the attribute language is above, if you know that a particular application will be sent text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the properties in the speaker area, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the default speakers button and then use the speaker, which is the best of the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I've compiled Debug support, but I don't get any traceability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and & ktats; you probably have to register GStreamer. in GStreamer 0.8.x you probably have to register GStreamer. if the problem is not solved this might be a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output over ALSA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application. if I get a text order, freezes & ktats; a. on the console; appears a message stating: unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">On your system there is a problem that conflicts occur at ALSA, which prevent simultaneous opening of several PCM devices. for possible solutions, please visit the website of the ALSA project (dmix) at www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I invited an additional voice for festival from the Internet. I installed it and can use it in festival, but kttsmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / kttsd / festivalve / vocals added the new voice. as a guide you can serve the other entries. if this is successful, please send a patch together with the URL; on which you have found the voice to the developers.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the PATH environment variable. some synthesizer modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed even on the card board for microphone setup. depending on the selected voice, this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for the speech speed are ignored if & ktats; & HTML; prefers. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Enter either the conversion of & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML-reshape filter, and set the talk speed up.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't want websites to be read with a female voice. I have set up a female festival spokesman, but & ktats; reads the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta the tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. so that Festival does not produce any errors, the xsl file accuses to convert SSML to Saber the GENDER tags. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added a separate string release filter and now I can do it in & ktats; no more set-up or return. on the tab orders is displayed, the order consists only of one set. what do I do wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You are not allowed to filter punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead use a filter for set limits detection.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure the modules for GStreamer are registered by accessing & ktats using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience in connection with ALSA conflicts during audio output. if your system also counts, you can't play music simultaneously and read a text. & ktats; freezes if you pause a text assignment and then start another. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of ALSA (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">As of July 2005, aKode still doesn't support any real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktats, the current set will be read before.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio program sox is used for the general setting of the speaking speed, but is otherwise not mandatory. Debian users can install sox using the apt-get install sox command. the program is included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded & ktats; as tarball (with tar packed archive), log in as a normal user and unzip the tarball into a matching folder. change to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4 the module & arts; probably removed or at least created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependency of non-free software. (non-free according to Debian guidelines). the configure option to disable the creation shows the configure parameter that causes the transition of the creation.</seg>
<seg id="2765">As default, & ktats; in / opt / kde3 is installed. if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $KDEDIRS, you must specify as an option --prefix = goal.</seg>

<seg id="2767">CD kttsd &gt; inst apps make -f Makefile.cvs. / configure cd kttsd make su make install</seg>
<seg id="2768">Before you use & ktts; first, check if your synthesizer works properly. follow the instructions you received using the Synthesizer.</seg>
<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and there are several voices and languages supported. with many voices you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch with & ktats.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You must install at least one language. help is found in the instructions supplied with the festival. if you want to read websites, you need to install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">You need to compile an additional module for these voices, so you need the source code of the festival. German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice presupposes festival 1.95 beta or newer. the voice is still in an early stage of development. unpack the software in festival / lib / vocals / russian /. if you set up the Russian voices, you need to type for the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. select a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the & Linux distributions. therefore, look for the festival as the first one on the CDs of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to 8-bit Cyrillic like koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">The festival can be used together with the MBROLA and Synthesizer. then festival takes over the lexical analysis and & MBROLA; resulting from it the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the & MBROLA; -voices can be downloaded from</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; allowing management of network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a range of system and desktop settings via a uniform, integrated surface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be accessed by selecting K menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworks.-package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & kcontrolcenter; the areas of & knetwork.create a simple interface for the user to perform the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After the installation, a new module network settings are displayed at the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetwork.) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & network network settings in the & KMenu; started.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured to allow & knetwork.the device at all displays and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed to install and install Linux. if network devices are added later, the drivers need to be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module will be loaded when the network settings option is selected at the & kcontrolcenter; when the module network settings are started, this will automatically detect the system used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection will be offered. it is the platform from the list that best fits the distribution and the Releasestand. by selecting the setting No-Again the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, then this selection will be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in the system management mode. previously, all options are gray, meaning the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you get system management mode at the right bottom end of the module. it is necessary to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">In the system management mode, the entire functionality of the module is available. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab interfaces are used to manage network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed from the tab network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to show the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">In automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are taken from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system will be carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information for each system start, so you can choose either DHCP or BOOTP according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">By selecting Manually, the TCP / IP configuration can be done without DHCP or BOOTP. the desired TCP / IP address must be specified in the input field IP address. the netmask must be specified in the netmask input field.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the network, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in case of doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. switching on a switched off network device will be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned off as required. disable an activated network device can be disabled by selecting from the list and clicking the interface....</seg>

<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A computer with DNS support replaces a full domain addition by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer requesting http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS triggers this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The calculator for name resolution Part of the name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS entries can be rearranged by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the buttons down or down in priority.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group calculator to name resolution, a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. then the entry will be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button....</seg>
<seg id="2825">The name known calculator describes machine name-to-IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used for booting when there are no DNS servers available. in small, closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally the list of names known by name contains some entries, the & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses support. this still in the test version of IP should replace in future version 4.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add the New Alias dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the known machine and click the Add button. if the known computer has multiple alias names, press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit.... Edit Calculator dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then click OK to update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the module network settings are not effective immediately in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be deprecated.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages), it is sufficient if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the fully compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a package; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool can be used with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2836">For this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; in addition, the development packages are required with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended by experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile the following commands.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter, important information about basic network technology will be given, and in the second section all of & knetwork.configurable configuration files will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge about IP networks. in this appendix, only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is given.</seg>
<seg id="2840">Currently, IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found widespread dissemination. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing the IP address of a network interface. in external networks, at the & eg; workplace is the network administrator to use a valid IP address or if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet, so any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be made possible by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are usually used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all hosts are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is needed for the IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally, the address 127.0.0.1 is assigned to a so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circuit.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed at DSL connections, so it is not surprising if in the case of active DSL connections, there is another content to be found there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand as expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives based on tar. it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which also offered the ability of dds2tar for quick, selective packing. the second aim was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it must be taken from & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; return the tape and read the prestressing information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't know the credits on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat; the pretext, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been incorporated. in the status bar a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed by folding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, first the integration needs to be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; there is a change in the symbol for the band to see the connection for the band has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the band can now be ejected without any danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat; formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type needs to be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive requires that a tape needs to be formatted before use, this must happen before you can format it from & kdat. floppy disk drives usually require formatting of the tape, but DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the tape name and the capacity, the tape continues; with the format of the tape, all data on the tape is lost! after the formatting process is finished, the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be saved. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup is started, the dialog box opens. in this dialog, you can once again check the selected files and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you confirm the settings, the dialog appears. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including data rate and time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on any of the archives and select the menu item Verification....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog box will appear. in this dialog, you can check your selection once more and change the working folder for the review.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you confirm the verification settings, the dialog appears to check. this dialog shows the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can initiate the restore, the files that need to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive entry. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the Settings dialog will appear. in this dialog, you can once again check your selection and change the work folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">When you confirm the recovery settings, the Restore dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the time remaining.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the band index file with the content of the tape. this process erases all existing index files for this volume. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can specify the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is updated automatically according to the currently selected work folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed in backup files, only the files in the same file system will be backed up as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be added separately under backup files. each entry is viewed by tar independently of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before the call of tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">& gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set the settings on the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can do the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (normally / dev / tape). this path must refer to the non-winding device of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">This setting is active, transmits & kdat; before the tape is mounted, the command will be loaded to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading and writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; to lock the throw from the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, when releasing the & kdat file, the tape will automatically be kicked off. do not use this option for floppy drives.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is turned on, try & kdat; not all drives support variable block sizes. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must tell & kdat; in any case the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & kdat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file is composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The band ID. the format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape has been formatted. seconds is the number of seconds passed since the era in which the tape has been formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band id will be used to find a file named in the $HOME / .kdat file folder.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The rest of the files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a backup tape. this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted.</seg>

<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshots, & ksystemlog; functions available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After the start, & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system log - to open. will not show you this, and instead it opens a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very likely not with system administrator rights. the protocol files are usually found in / var / log, for normal users usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or entered string. add a string to the filter bar. the list of the log lines will be changed automatically, so that only the log lines that match the selected filter will be displayed. then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term will then only be compared with the entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the name of a process, so show you & ksystemlog; all the protocol lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines. transcript lines of level errors are indicated with a more eye-catching color as minutes lines of the level indication. the colored representation of protocol lines can be disabled setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to display a specific process (e.g. in the system log or in the cron protocol), you can show the process identification (PID) in the trial column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can enable the Add to New Lines option in the Main Window's context menu to display all the new lines that are added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple protocol files in separate sub-windows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website at http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. There you will find more current information on the sources of reference & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find the following folder in the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; -archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named so) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init is fast becoming the standard for controlling program start when running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and re-formatting. the & Linux kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The sysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc This folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for each system service you want to start when you run the system or when you switch to another run level. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial that is started only once. such calls include rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up something, then you can fix it by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument such as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually on the command line like this:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script is invoked with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; run a server run level that only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; running. in addition, I could also have a user -Runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc; starts.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is simple to not trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runstitn or change the position within a level by moving somewhere else. this will only happen when you remove an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved if you drag them into a new section. to simply copy them to a new Runlevel, you need to explicitly select from the Edit menu item or from the context menu and paste it to the target area -- even if the same entry has been in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The Sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case you need to edit the Sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before attempting to insert the system service again.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: at present there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the tab key to activate the various workspaces (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or bottom of the previous.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to another Runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of loss of data, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with the standard Runstitn and now the machine is constantly reworking. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single-user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default run level to a reasonable value (3 should usually be in order).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; run under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using SuSE or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only present in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies configuration for the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not conform to any standard. authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check if all configuration files are present (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as eg; Apache and httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or misconfigured.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The meaning of the & Linux; -all level varies from distribution to distribution, may even be different from version to version. if you are using any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser; to begin, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you must save it. either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save in the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two flashcards, the user name and the user group list. to edit select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you have enabled space constraints (quota) for users, a flashcard will be created where you can make individual adjustments.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The password management card appears in case shadow passwords, for example / etc / master.passwd like in BSD Unix, are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card will only appear if for at least one filesystem space limitation (quota) is activated and initialized (identifiable to the file quota.user / quota.group on the filesystem).</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system is selected using the field filesystem with limited space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The flashcard groups inform about the group affiliations of the selected user. the default group, to which the user belongs, can be found in the Primary group field. furthermore, the user can be a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the user or group menu or click the appropriate Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works similarly.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove and change the boot password, change the time to boot the default operating system, remove, remove, change operating systems, remove, change and more.</seg>
