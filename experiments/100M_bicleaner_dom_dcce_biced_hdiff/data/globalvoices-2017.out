although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and operated his sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
at the age of 14 , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the supreme Federal Court with judges who were inclined to his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA only strengthened .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even had written a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain , as you say so beautifully .
he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and openly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people re@@ acted to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in Republi@@ can Pre @-@ elections was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominated by the party .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which takes people from all over the world , a deep @-@ believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past .
Tr@@ umps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; playing .
b@@ umps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
she still fits in with the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump had gu@@ essed his way to nominated repub@@ li@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception to the rule .
on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the discussion with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is superficial and respect@@ ful , and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that those voters who are most white have voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to lift a man looking down with cont@@ emp@@ t upon those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( remark of the Ü ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white revol@@ t against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; white and whi@@ pl@@ ash tone &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big Van Jones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; has killed exactly what America has done so great . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ uan , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with Donald Tr@@ ump , however , a huge part of the white America gives up this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election .
on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a talk with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd shou@@ ted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could someone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ ump Land , the message said .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music by tr@@ ash
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
the fact that the music played in both places not only has changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located at the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for several years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome poverty .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse of drugs and the use of gangs .
but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope for the youth .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes local press Noti@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI :
as soon as they come out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
you always come laugh@@ ing and with shining eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le and bu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from tr@@ ash
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located virtually on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments made of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers began under the leadership of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez in order to turn parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion all made out of waste .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc .
in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days :
at first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio was shown something that he had never seen before : a violin made of waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic Müll@@ land@@ fill ) records the musical performance :
every year , the world produces about one billion tons of waste .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
the Philharmonic Orchestra follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team@@ work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems .
re @-@ publishing happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liber@@ ian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a law@@ break@@ er of this kind on their shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to permit him fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior manager of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . he is part of a team who discovered and pursued the ship at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not successful for him to catch fish there .
finally , it was also forced to pay $ 2 million to Liberia due to pil@@ lage of fish stocks in the country .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was founded by F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) .
the members of this network , alongside Somalia and Madagascar , are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters back then .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they exchange information and stand up for illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , therefore it is extremely difficult to trace . this makes illegal fishing a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also by the sn@@ ail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions happen nowadays in real time , trace@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also atten@@ tively follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is inviting its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal code .
countries opposed to illegal fishing may , on the basis of this information , refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay sanctions , as in the case of the Premier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , senior director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform has been created to attract an estimated $ 20 million in lost revenues , which lose the eight members of the H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network every year because of illegal fishing that inv@@ ade East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these illegal fishing fishermen .
their practices include sailing under false flag , bog@@ us license papers , speci@@ fying fantasy names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You can &apos;t run my harbor &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front has been working .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that shared fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and found and found addic@@ tive ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and preserve information about illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position . and this is what we try to cross , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships switch off , for example , their automatic identification systems , so they can &apos;t be located any more from satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is designed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally active ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence this un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Protection Organisation : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the location of each tracking vessel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who &apos;s doing what is happening - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals , but also deter them .
ships that used to fish earlier without a license and hardly had to reck@@ on with consequences , now know they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now recorded a 33 % increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped Somalia detect Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , six countries have joined forces , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cop@@ eland says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was sailing under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a license and used drag nets , which are now banned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship has also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are considered prot@@ esting against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of the government , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the re@@ funds of Venezuela ) can be found both by these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Bar@@ inas area , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ northern Bun@@ de@@ staat Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is deterior@@ ating continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro ; in the end , however , the attitude of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision in her latest article as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rate belong to the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which there is a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine , the referendum on the disposal of many was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance called Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( about : round table of the Democratic Unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly .
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

Twitter collects pictures that tell of arguments , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
particularly large waves struck the news of police repression in the centrally located northern city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators then went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ á@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts because one might otherwise see something that many national Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic does the round that forms the amount of repression a day :
thus the dictatorship supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for an im@@ pe@@ achment procedure , which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless men on the streets .
my@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , made little effort against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ fers to refrain from critic@@ ising critical voices :
they took us so much - but also the fear !
the mar@@ ches tend to increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to see the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now in the area of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cór@@ doba against his father .
in the trial concluded on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he kept the family secret for himself .
in the situation at that time I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child at the age of 15 , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a period of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the intelligence division 141 in La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father .
his story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :

that is why he prohibited me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine . for this is how my father had nour@@ ished me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

the prisoners are tor@@ tured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with everything in 1976 .
the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were put off and stopped me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I entered in , and saw a lying on which men were tor@@ tured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they put on the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was just tied there .
they seldom entr@@ en@@ ched a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ took him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and carried e@@ ye@@ witnesses .
he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian also accused in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face down - all were bound by hands and feet .
near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father saw that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why do you look like as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you get me from ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra there were several rooms that were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero crashing a man there and killed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors of the civil war Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , was sentenced to death by the student Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the Memorial Site of La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way the ab@@ duc@@ ts came here .
when you look at the map , you can see that they took about this road and then were tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ isation .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be laid .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; spo@@ ils &apos;
my father brought home all possible stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was later on the military , - I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war yield is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military insignia , which one takes away from an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... it is not a war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal your cars on the streets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I &apos;ll find you and kill you by yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else for that !
this is how my father was .
I have not a single good memory of him .
as I said in the process , I showed a photo from then , on which I wore a jacket and a pul@@ ley pul@@ lover of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor , but he still brought clothing home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can impose on me what they wanted .
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now that I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you have executed human beings during the dictatorship , but why can the corp@@ ses disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why do their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families to whom one could give their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that can be done to a human being .
my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were grin@@ ded and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something always remains .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just told the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made accus@@ ations for him because of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , then show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 , I allowed the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can reproach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .
he was charged with 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 15@@ 8 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 cases , torture followed by death in five cases , and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under the age of 10 .

the Jud@@ gments in &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of judgment in Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process ended up because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims in August .
43 subjects were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases prison sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ State terrorism
all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees .
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted along with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Court of Justice is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the 1995 Argent@@ ine@@ an organisation H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted for more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be erected there , which is now run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; translation error makes older people in Kyoto a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation error in a centre in Kyoto where one can pro@@ long his driving licence .
the photo was spread in social media .
edited the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Kyoto city Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , witnessed a particularly mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous translation during the last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word is represented on a shield , which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrong@@ ly , but perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been divided in many ways in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a citizen of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in the Kyoto Protocol , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the faulty English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kyoto police ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported the following about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely ap@@ ologi@@ ze that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News featured a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who have been involved nationwide in accidents is quite a matter of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
this increased their share to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents in total has sun@@ k , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period .
the specifically un@@ named repor@@ ter brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , showing what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently cher@@ ish against older drivers :
the article on the translation error of Yahoo , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is that ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , the translation is actually not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a true treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language .
the latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the belief that translators should be native speakers in the target language - not in the initial language .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language , which may produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies , who do not have foreign employees themselves , can still produce translations within the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English skills are valued as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are .

machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the verb@@ ose and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences generated by mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is particularly true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , among them the mysterious prints that often ad@@ orn t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . however , by large companies or by the government , which have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more accurate translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations .
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
&quot; &quot; &quot; main page of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online transmitter .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organized by op@@ posi@@ tional groups that oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was ch@@ apped , and recommended the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# C@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
facilities such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with Internet access , especially in times of tur@@ mo@@ il .
traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw it as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
amazing that this is still more favourable than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two more on @-@ line stations .
earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domain requests .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds poorly or den@@ ies the request by calling on such a website .
we confirm a DNS barrier : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third @-@ locked channel , the broadcast was dis@@ continued on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was arrested .
Flor@@ es was beaten , while he was in custody .
he was released eight hours later , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections , making it more difficult for Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia reports on current events in the country .
in Paraguay a lot of girls become slaves to get a training
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ m@@ son as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mean tas , which have become victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report by structural that is published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , deca@@ ying Schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one from which something has become , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old , she began working as a cri@@ mp for the family . as a cri@@ m@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money survi@@ ves her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , ri@@ cher family . in exchange , the child receives food , a training and a roof above the head .
however , what is not mentioned is that the children have to work for a number of days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot lift .
this practice called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay owing to the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ mean ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name things by name , as the feeling of gratitude that is ino@@ cul@@ ated with the cri@@ m@@ ta guarantees in general silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , there is the family , whose daughter is in faith that she can complete her education , improve her position in society and &quot; make something out of herself &quot; to another family .
on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl and whose exploitation with faith justi@@ fies that they give someone a chance otherwise would not receive education and maybe even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will experience it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , has a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín was hospit@@ alized in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of intense pun@@ ches . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military personnel , Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with just 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra attacked Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered deadly injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ mp .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF and Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela were responsible for the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , for the death of the girl .
they described the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compla@@ ined .
without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children without imp@@ unity .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a quick investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her cri@@ m@@ son .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be indic@@ ative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the everyday life of a Cri@@ mean ta
the Cri@@ mean tas are exploited not only as workers but also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , had to join bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job .
their brothers now had to work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money .
they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in Cri@@ van@@ ta .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in her employer &apos;s house between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she got up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days , for example , she cleaned the refrigerator , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the sooner she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick up more books from the library of the master than food from the fridge , &quot; she recalls .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
in doing so , he tried to convince her to not believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not talk to her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the owner had found someone who listened while he was talking about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they often didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; again &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and child girl in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad received five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the town of Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman who also came out of Ñ@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third commentary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the interior that wants to work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was written . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the author of the advertisement turned out once more :
dear friends , I found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again when something is .
the business was completed .
in the pro@@ lo@@ gue to the report Cri@@ mean tas , ¿ ha@@ sta cu@@ án@@ do ?
( Cri@@ mean tas , how long ? ) , a collection of testim@@ onies of former Cri@@ mean tas , writes Or@@ ti@@ z :
in the course of our history we managed to abol@@ ish systems such as slavery , cu@@ ñ@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the Con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ í had to pay tribute to them ) and the system of the Mens@@ a ( in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors were forced to pay tribute to them ) , and that many girls and boys go into a system of slavery , where they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
the social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the show of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill introduces Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians have recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; regulating the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law a place would then be set up , which is assigned to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law , users must have their right names and identity numbers registered on the website in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months &quot; imprisonment or a fine of money .
the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ses in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video content and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose their registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , member of parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of this it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network .
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; senior researcher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they could physically control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take it seriously , it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who apply for authorisation or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to supply them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
technically , this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and that no dis@@ sent@@ ing nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life sentence was fores@@ een for those found guilty of threatening &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; calling for protest . &quot;
how a Kurdish natural conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the war @-@ drawn Iraq
one of the rare Persian le@@ op@@ ards .

this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions .
high up in the mountains of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in the north east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian Leopard .
a sub@@ type of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards strikes through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of its habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian Leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video therefore finds that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to portra@@ y a different side of her country , which is not just out of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 , it has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to ensuring that protected areas for wildlife in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region are set up .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the responsible daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a number of pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast that had both experienced the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbor@@ hoods Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had left entire coastal cities away from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture saw a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after , in order to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese re@@ building as well as survey results of the affected people themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare @-@ homes ( for the time being ) were completed in the pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate .
the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures was reported by Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , where 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent .
however , even six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated the evacu@@ ation of accomodation units ( v@@ ast@@ ly , Kaz@@ ak@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to res@@ ett@@ le in final sub@@ stitu@@ tions .
after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of those who evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ations , who were hau@@ ling after the disaster in temporary shel@@ ters , were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number here is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 out of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened its doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5@@ 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ lands by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nuclear zone of blocking &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far back .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent here .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dw@@ ellers found it harder to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ations . it questioned them about the state of re@@ building and how their emp@@ athy has changed against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also directed her attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ations from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
of 160 000 evacu@@ ations from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63@@ ,000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 , more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been reloc@@ ated to permanent spare houses .
after the state of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es most of the evacu@@ ations are older than 50 years old . it is known to be able to get back in proper dwell@@ ings because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma must compete with massive construction projects . this is a construction project that is part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be larger than the simil@@ arities .
after a while one often detects that one connects more than it seems at first sight .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , let &apos;s look at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .
Ver@@ oni@@ ka Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music over@@ came her affection for the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widespread photograph .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest march throughout the country .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás noted that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the end of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer would beat a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , announced the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees Mat@@ eus being attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs soon ha@@ sten to him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while lying in the hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado invites further attacks against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and here we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care unit after being attacked by a polic@@ eman who has hit him with a bat@@ on .
police gri@@ ps
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only country in Brazil where brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators came on last Friday .
polic@@ emen were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Pe@@ op@@ les Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media covered street protests by focusing on a different , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane .
the fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window in order to make a photo of their titles illustr@@ atively .
the O Glob@@ o , on the other hand , preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic purpose to report more about a broken window screen than over the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of property damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too , the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the villages forgotten by the de@@ du @-@ induc@@ ement in Cuba
with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harvest on site .
it was two years since the activities were paraly@@ sed in the sugar cane factories .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities , until only the steel and concrete sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active period are back into operation because they were preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene re@@ members to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane sugar factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a novel@@ ty .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete and hardly competitive , they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they only allowed the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis in the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose again a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 cent must remain a pound , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ and@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education .
the same happened in the sugar cane plant Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats the most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dec@@ eit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters started .
it was officially auth@@ ored documents which would be distinguished only with respect to the parts that would be removed , the address and date .
all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still operating in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench producer has been wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the plants in the congregations in which they were located .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane sugar factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ soci@@ ate it , they also stopped to gr@@ asp@@ ing the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other factories .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production serves not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still imposing .

first Nations young people use hip hop to express themselves and get their own culture
&quot; &quot; &quot; recording of a song from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot; &quot; &quot;

youth of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do it using hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop is thus increasing that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever comes into mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the trunk of the Kit@@ sum@@ eb First Nation in British Columbia tells , for example , the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of T@@ ears , &quot; a street section in Western Canada , where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
most of the cases were not solved .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young@@ sters did not always command the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refrain will be sung on cre@@ e .
the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from Nor@@ th@@ movie Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Gruppe , who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available as well as a translation into English which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I try to go on my days on earth
that is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise ourselves one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move forward with our youth .
so they can do what they intended the Creator for .
in the commentary section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( free of charge ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan , you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) are exhibited by any food that is served in this restaurant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
customers will see these kinds of plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo subur@@ b of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of small companies producing plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented over 20 years ago in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend nowadays turns them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin re@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile phone bands decorated with plastic dishes as they are shown at the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station .
the new boom in food delivery is becoming increasingly complicated .
in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phone stand .
we also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phones allow you to make your own work of art . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or Lach@@ s@@ rogen is used , a popular t@@ opping , served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands of dried salmon .
more bizarre plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow us on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # ...
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the city of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which dedic@@ ates itself to the pleasure of the restaurant industry . for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the missing and killed often only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the report on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background .
the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the communities that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
therefore , the Mexican news portal Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co started the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; to live with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , to give these sacrifices a voice and tell stories of people who were engaged in the battle between law enforcement and cart@@ els .
Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her ne@@ ph@@ ews on just one day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task we have set ourselves , to go away and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it is very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training .
there is also my mother , who is here also with me .
at the moment , she has no income .
you stand for the assurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where do we get it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the leadership of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I &apos;ve known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
every day I pass by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the titles of titles with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from acts of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as though I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) if he &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people &apos;s sel@@ fl@@ essness is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to argue that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies if they do not stir and remain silent .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family has been lo@@ oted with threats . &quot; it describes how armed criminals black@@ ma@@ iled money from their business month by month until they had destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days .
the pain of it never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested because they don &apos;t know when they will lead or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself if wines would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I have forgotten how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation signed by violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
how is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care for them .
Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make Chi@@ chi for the babies living with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody corp@@ se of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was viol@@ ated by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the coun@@ cill@@ or for public security and the government of the Government of the United States .
in 2010 alone , the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office amounted to 3@@ 103 deaths . this corresponds to 8.5 Mor@@ des per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we must not forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Ani@@ mal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co created the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades in an understandable way .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ MENT : this post and the pages to which it links contain pictures where violence is represented .
the fact check is important at a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter whether it is true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not neg@@ ate the fact that there is ample careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died there .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous path@@ ways full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tan@@ ker fell victim to it .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball , which envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , full of people watching the World Cup .
houses burned and burnt corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to be un@@ recognizable .
a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies , lined up on the floor while people look at them .
but here the story does not end .
over the years , the same photo has been inter@@ cep@@ ted several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported drastically of atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in roads and bushes .
reports were reported , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one left behind to count bodies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Human Rights Watch resident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted figur@@ atively .
the occasion for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s attempt to gain land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture from the DR Congo resur@@ faced when it was fal@@ sely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack :
this is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has been docum@@ enting orders to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings .
another step further brings personal comments like this example fal@@ sely the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments .
the picture of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a lightning detection , published by the United Nations describes those who could flee to blows , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others of the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya reported , posts like the following appeared , bringing together those descriptions with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arabic news page , fal@@ sely claiming 2012 that the president &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein had said monks and politicians had participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was last accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not associated the image of the DR Congo .
the global reach of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ ples extend back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inver@@ ted image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
they come from a mix of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed on false reports , some have attempted to expose fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of mis@@ use and associated them with the respective countries on the basis of which page they had been published . thus , we want to portra@@ y the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases have also been linked ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use may come from .
here are some cases that can now be fully detected ( on the orange map ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of false copies of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers , where the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ si@@ fications are still available .
the grey countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of counter@@ fei@@ ting examples .
as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeria and interested Arabs ) as part of a &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

Malaysia offers two extreme examples of mis@@ use of the image of DR Congo , on the one hand , a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger who pursu@@ es claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being persecuted , since the photos were mis@@ used .

this post , directed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , makes it clear that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims who kill Christians .

they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Chinese ) , 2014 .
after a message was put into circulation by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the embassy in which the picture was contained in the DR Congo , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
with other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in grey ) Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp ) exist on the craw@@ ler and in some cases they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may ultimately have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focused on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence related to the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the dis@@ semination of forci@@ ble images has been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , worry is that violent images des@@ ensi@@ tise readers and viewers , and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , but it can also be used in the context of a completely mis@@ used way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
these words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese Cel@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Sob@@ ot@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or an expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s Mw@@ ot@@ lap , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - strive for your parents in recognition as to how they worked for you in your younger years .
and words in the H@@ uns@@ poe@@ tical language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - the convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
they def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess other cultures , reveal other thought processes and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speakers of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite places here . &quot; &quot; &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have tra@@ m@@ pled over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
according to an opinion from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dge av@@ al@@ an@@ ches .
more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence .
rainf@@ alls slow@@ ed on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly declined .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ for@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situations .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods devast@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after more rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus was in high water , water level up to 6 meters . the village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are completed to transport emergency deliveries to the inhabitants of their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka have important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call the number 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and nec@@ es@@ sities for flood victims -
today we are in the region around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call us today the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this area need help .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app to inform the cad@@ enza centre .
last year after the disaster of the tropical storm of Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; flood relief &quot; button allowing users to call a vehicle for pick @-@ up of assistance and donations . they were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross free of charge .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations caused by floods and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need in safety and provide aid measures .
this has prevented the loss of other lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore normal@@ cy .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I trust her my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me with her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
in the one minute we still call slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next one we have rights for trans@@ gender .
we are in a sea of umbrellas and people , some consider the i@@ kon@@ ian image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things don &apos;t concern you , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their conception .
they had to lim@@ b me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
in our collective imagination , this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , as I do not fit in , become un@@ fit .
ab@@ domin@@ ance of the body
I &apos;m not alone .
this is even done to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you get into mind when you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day when he died .
but in the Western imagination , the Rum@@ i religion was wi@@ ped out , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been col@@ oni@@ fying Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward S@@ aid sh@@ attered the story behind these images .
but these pictures also stand out today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , defective nar@@ rations dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that in the past three decades nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 .
this narrative fails to recognise that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought here with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deep and er@@ ron@@ eous that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim aggression and ch@@ ic@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
are among the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or to alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the tri@@ pod of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims represent the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America in the highest degree . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation migrants from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York . sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
back then when Khan re@@ invented the world sky@@ lines , my parents were fast Muslims and Americans .
but am I now an absolute Muslim and American woman ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs that all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I j@@ ok@@ er , we don &apos;t carry all the ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also need to be no the@@ ological experts in order to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing tape by a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bic machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in more than just a stranger who tears a woman &apos;s head .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only then born into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they resort to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf that I am Muslim , if she could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the ritual of every evening with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and her Arab verses for protection , who seal the Qur &apos;@@ an and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

belonging is the image of my grandmother &apos;s mother@@ ly side with her sisters ; as she has decades ago winning a competition of art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi .
it is the image of her that at this moment I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi Holy ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
to be Muslim means speaking the prayers that she had told me to speak if I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - over the centuries - have been colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire &quot; that has founded a company with the name of Ven@@ erable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a profound meaning to call God my only Lord .

belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries .
in between , while writing books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept over his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , ruled by India , which he could not close in half a century .
belonging to it is knowing that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as in the game risk .
to be Muslim means knowing that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ alized &quot; all to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dropped from a century over a Muslim country .
it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mere sub@@ tan of the British empire , was described as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent , apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried beneath the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy hits the US and the susp@@ ects wearing a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination attempt .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people over@@ filled the airports to fight against Muslim Bash@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and if we say black lives count .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist signi@@ fies inher@@ ently inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple con@@ jun@@ ctions , but fail to communicate them to others .

being a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals are building structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .

we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous pic@@ torial im@@ prints that we have in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

and that moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that con@@ spir@@ ators who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead the White House .

there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years earlier , they had not yet given them ; now they dominate huge areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who made me an ir@@ reversible Muslim today .
things I have left behind in my speech like a bread@@ cr@@ umb trace .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I talk about this here at TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are w@@ aged and people have been moderni@@ zed by the creation of the &quot; other &quot; in the public imagination , four decades ago , was himself ac@@ adem@@ ically the Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously to consoli@@ date the &quot; other . &quot; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Initiative Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been running events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
for the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening frequently is connected with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to listening to cher@@ ish , feel , touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers first expose their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their depic@@ tion lead to the audience &apos;s commitment to it .
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as though the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional Burkina Faso story , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also sei@@ zes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of stor@@ y@@ telling .
in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ a@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the vian in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the importance of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ us ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling stories .
Puerto Rico requests US re @-@ establishment of sovereign debt
with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3 , 2017 ; the march started from the capital city of Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went to Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ an .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la D@@ eu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tizen &apos;s Front for the Ne@@ uro @-@ examination of Deb@@ t ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishing the debt have also filed a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
the people of Puerto Rico are calling for politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts to be held responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico are ref@@ using to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with declining pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the territory of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
for this reason , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organisation with no party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state supervision .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a comprehensive restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the outside imposed measures , without the participation and conviction of the citizens , will run risk to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the Syri@@ ac @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , an event was dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a scientist of the French CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , director of Book S@@ prints , produced finished books within three to five days , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : collective research ) .
the book , which was published last year and is available here license @-@ free , contains a number of es@@ says dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the Intro@@ duction it is said :
this book aims to discuss how to build movement for free knowledge and what is the true cost associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked alongside page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book entitled &quot; Collec@@ tive Memory &quot; gives his friends and family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
the web developer for Open Source and Digital Activ@@ ist has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown location from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police &quot; had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that it had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who themselves presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband .
however , its where@@ ab@@ outs and condition remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded the b@@ ass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ ques &apos;s cultural prototypes were more pro@@ vision@@ ary than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civil@@ isations and here , Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not know that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it , em@@ bo@@ dying this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not yet conclude this project .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in jail :
I spent my whole life dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in prison .
I learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write , and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabian into English .
the book is available free of charge .
book cover from Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens at every visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace us ,
that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I return quickly to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to rec@@ la@@ im all the moments ,
and to cry over your absence and smile .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story of Bas@@ que is not unique in Syria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of force were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of b@@ ass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call for the hope that we must do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique : back to previous post for corruption convic@@ ted director after release
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case where a government member returned after half of his prison sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed .
it is Di@@ o@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other defend@@ ants , was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants due to mis@@ appropri@@ ation of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 Euro ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , the Council of which has managed Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which rejected the request , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer to his old post , as the company did not fulfil any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment .
however , many people don &apos;t like the action well .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , in an interview with Deutsche Welle , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish its director :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also have initiated a disciplinary action against the offen@@ ders .
the company , however , apparently kept silent and made no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambique social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; passive &quot; :
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant , after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had subsi@@ ded .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he has cons@@ ented to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for its silence .
not to the contrary !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not have any moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za failed to return to morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served itself only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre @-@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was rewarded in such a way .
Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to recall that a th@@ ief is in prison :
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to remain in the memory of the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans as the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
one of his most famous oral representations , when he testified energe@@ tically that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not like that . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison for 10 years and he was free .

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as adj@@ ective &quot; In@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook zen@@ zes the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represented &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ kam@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ sier A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play of words .
the proposition ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different .
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ oms believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it destro@@ ys all posts that are suspected of spreading rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to fac@@ be@@ ak .
what should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words opposite .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a pretty good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to all who propag@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new Facebook page , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , post and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail &quot; did not conform to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author comments on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae k@@ h@@ ine believes Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring even greater hatred within the different communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it seems as if they have started this without any local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pe@@ as cur@@ ry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users are now jo@@ king about Facebook and deliberately write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts containing no hate language , but still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post says &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the past five years extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speeches on his bur@@ ge@@ al sides .
but rather than cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of childhood
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law which should ban this practice , so that the marriage @-@ ready age is now 18 .
before this change of the married couple , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities adher@@ ed to the practice , and in May 2016 there was a great public cry . at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , a group leader of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere , since that means that age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical Central Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which ende@@ avor@@ ed to abol@@ ish laws for children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation to say the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition was causing tensions in this un@@ complicated issue , and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the draft law against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
now only the president of the country must appro@@ ve and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was approved in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and not one against it .
having previously been approved by the Senate , the draft may now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws for children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minister of the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk that concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel was in the opinion , it took definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ ent@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of marriage has been decided .
minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was , noted :
the marriage @-@ ready age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now amounts to 18 years irrespective of the religious affili@@ ation .
the draft on the change of the marriage network was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 .
there were 41 dep@@ u@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
all parliam@@ ent@@ arians , who were contrary , voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long struggle ( ... ) # child@@ adri@@ ag@@ ei@@ tor@@ d@@ abuse .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
thanks to our dep@@ u@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization in the country .
months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to dis@@ integrate his promise .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al Ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users desired that the debate on the subject would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
rather , instead of speaking of the problem , instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of speaking of the problem , would simply talk about the state that protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are opposed to them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm , although there are laws which prohi@@ bit them .

on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ ded with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day - the website of the Prosecutor of the district of Y@@ ar@@ osla@@ v@@ l was h@@ ack@@ ed . the h@@ ack@@ ers have left a funny message &quot; Abi@@ de at home .

on Sunday , the Office of the Prosecutor announced the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring websites , Turkish users can look back on Wikipedia content
the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright Law in the USA , internationally black@@ ed .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has now closed the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful as well as reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking .
although many Internet users are used to using circum@@ vention tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted .
according to China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform continues to remain closed , several mirror sites ( sites that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) are now displayed .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator connections ) , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available , however , in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
after listening to the messages ( via Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content on a decentr@@ alized and distributed way .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
an sich N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with mis@@ placed motifs and washed out colors .
this motiv@@ ates him to wear a camera himself and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring Nepal &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his home town next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when I suddenly called me Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the dam is only a few minutes away from Sau@@ ra@@ ha tourist resort .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began kne@@ eling pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition of Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he was already facing Tig@@ ers face to face ,
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
I too was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the king of the bu@@ si@@ est appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at us and he star@@ es at me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of Nepal &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Ot@@ ters in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds living near the tourist accommodation .
see below some of these photos .

years after the wedding , Indian women dare to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands
women in the small Indian village Gum@@ la J@@ am Gay@@ i in Jh@@ ark@@ hand .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women with the greatest care avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , and fear of consequences should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a mock court and inf@@ ring@@ ed by her family and the village community after she had contacted a married couple .
the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer ad@@ mitt@@ ances to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health personnel as well as house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city .
it is a place only for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the Community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected people , and manages these clubs .
she tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them amb@@ ass@@ adors for change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion group was women who did not name their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open up a conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands al@@ oud , is a custom that they all bear responsibility and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is seen as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home as it runs .
she showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video ended .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him now by his name .
with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini started her first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; said Roh@@ ini Pa@@ is from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she ch@@ oked only before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in the adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at the name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law soli@@ di@@ fied her , she was afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ c@@ amber spot on the forehead , which shows the status of the mar@@ ital status :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ b@@ ary point if he did it too .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose for themselves , not to carry it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at every discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so tru@@ thful about some things , for example , how our identi@@ ties were attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say some things al@@ oud , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothing .
some women in the group have borne only sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most this is okay , but some wanted to wear a Sal@@ ad @-@ Cur@@ ta , a wide shirt above a p@@ ant ; they did not dare .
after a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , mor@@ als linked to the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled her own couple of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far , we have only taken small steps .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , still do it , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ bert &apos;s red on their forehead .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling about more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how Roh@@ ini declares :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

for just about five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .

good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day .
and what could that be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;

bald men are de@@ ported and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men in Moz@@ ambique could be the target of attacks .
photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of ab@@ duction of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for dis@@ believing purposes , worries the police of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was found de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , declared the police spokes@@ man at Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia of the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudi@@ ces .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who intend to travel to the country :
be@@ ware of k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambique as bald men in Moz@@ ambique are aiming for ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police according to the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police are already pursuing the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zia , for probably abandoned rituals , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also acknow@@ le@@ dges that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches .
in the last few days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha informed the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty confron@@ ting Mos@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mo@@ c@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT I ashamed A country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , and would not even take their lives to make their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed for indul@@ gent purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; are hun@@ ted that aim to get a quick fortune .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for mac@@ ab@@ re humour could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a district , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokesperson Z@@ amb@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ faced :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and express our heart@@ felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding the public &apos;s access to the internet and open knowledge .
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our Arab blo@@ gger meeting in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ ques &quot; wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were themselves as the insi@@ der of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bash@@ ar &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 August 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials heard that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , Bass@@ el &apos;s oeu@@ vre is a pioneer of the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release over the past five years .
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the Syrian Network for Human Rights organisation .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no fewer than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in custody , such as the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : citizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community to the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the end of June .
in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) , having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; internal affairs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a spokes@@ man told that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nonetheless , China is still receiving calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , to release or allow him to be treated abroad .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has put together a number of foreign reactions .
United Nations , United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , UN High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations had to ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway Aff@@ air Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about the release of Li@@ u .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it had nothing to do with the decision .
the diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China , as exports were mostly blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
because of his imprisonment , he was not able to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union - European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for China to release Li@@ u as she shared in an explanation on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect that China abol@@ ishes all limitations of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members .
they should meet and receive all the visits they desire and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told the Americans to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on June 27 that the embassy requests the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the request of the US embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the couple the following :
protection and freedom such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations .
U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally .
I call on China to release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condition@@ ally so that he can embar@@ k on a proper medical treatment .
Germany - Germany
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the top priority . &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u might over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada and Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide adequate health care to Li@@ u and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always over@@ sees the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
Canada challenges China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and to release those rights to exercise these rights .
France - France
France &apos;s Foreign Ministry called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information if France will eventually record it .
Taiwan Ocean Territ@@ ory
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of land@@ land@@ ings in Taiwan requested China to release Li@@ u on 27 June and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tai@@ wan@@ ese law@@ gi@@ ver Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectu@@ als to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 , and that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectu@@ als and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered as a city .
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
it supports Singapore as a city to be considered .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land , we hear that ultimately we are not a country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ?
the reasons mentioned by Sh@@ an@@ am@@ amal@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he was inevitably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , cities that are permanently run by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears from the author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be Democrats , leaving the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power .
in the end , in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam the answers given to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system were really non @-@ answers .
he cam@@ ou@@ fla@@ ged corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng challenges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand .
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear this point as long as he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the City of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the critic@@ isms that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ scription .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore is more of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Singapore is not a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he is defending .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review dis@@ covers the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since it plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet of Cab@@ inet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they defend their city but not their country ?
who must pay back our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the periodi@@ cal Journey of a Dec@@ ade tends to affir@@ m that Singapore is and has always been a city :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proposition seems to have anger@@ ed many people of Singapur ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world exposed and another fac@@ et to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked most by me in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have been living in Japan since 1994 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many Canadi@@ ans maybe cook in rage if they are kept for Americans , but it doesn &apos;t bo@@ ther me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for someone who does not know , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans can attach a Canadian flag to their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as those guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends which I admire very much .
I wouldn &apos;t mind if I &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; is basically to be sp@@ ook@@ y - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian twin ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major feature of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just a cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence .
we lack the warm , open kindness which I now associate with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau takes the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ odi@@ zed Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
a pop band , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that preserves the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to dominate the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Ink describes a young man who tells him what regulations his girlfriend makes .
although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days , the video uploaded onto Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly in relation to the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army absolute decision @-@ making power over important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program of changing journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army which monitors online content and accused persons who were accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand sets out a strict protest against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic offen@@ se ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later , it was a put@@ sch of the army .
one of the problems the jun@@ ta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists are in prison because they allegedly have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the tribute of &quot; The Hunger Games &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with friendly permission .
the post @-@ war society slowly re@@ covers itself very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still strongly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages in the northern part of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ag@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carbon basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Eur@@ asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to sovi@@ et sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called the K@@ hr@@ u@@ sche@@ kas , symboli@@ ze the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are in decay and very rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or @-@ buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
approximately fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
approximately 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the Chr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ kas that still house one or two families can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in their hands , they immediately withdraw .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to let ourselves be photographed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area are working for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for their own needs ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable farming .
it is difficult to get over the rounds .
in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to J@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept financial support from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly pension is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

if holidays are , we will visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we can &apos;t do it all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children , lived in her house for a while .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she recalls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take some time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 child allowance for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was once , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work , and they all lived just as they were right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball which then rolls down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
while they are running , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings .
these ruins are a part of their childhood that care for their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any other way .

&quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Afrika &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses migrants on their long journey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is run by a 5@@ 9@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and gold coloured earrings in the form of a ted@@ dy bear .
it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . however , they know many of the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for approximately 2.@@ 50 dollars per night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez says , the people come in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry : &quot; Mama Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some also slept outdoors on cardboard .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when she is sick , she bu@@ ys drugs that they cannot afford , she mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived shortly .
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gurt ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil hoping to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very aff@@ ection@@ ate .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make their first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Afrika . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , it began its journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards in order to save the money needed to buy the ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez says that her guests often send text messages when they go to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a blind alley leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family immig@@ rated to their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are places where people can help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to black@@ mail money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single woman , offered him her roof .
a few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next steps .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
in the hall@@ ways , the travellers consult their phones quietly .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , most of them from Somalia .
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away .
like a proud Grand@@ mother she leaves her album with many photos .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ in for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang from Twitter users to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevents access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities had to use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ f@@ ecture because , shortly after they installed the app , they had exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
in the communication of the police , the app was intended to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gen &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network .
this app , designed for min@@ ors , is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
while reporting on digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focuses on users &apos; experiences in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority areas such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the areas of conflict , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine web shut@@ downs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Twitter based media outlet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which publishes cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police officers were random@@ ly checking whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point using a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which it emerges that the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive .
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize dis@@ semination of illegal content .
all government branches , authorities and institutions affiliated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the cy@@ ber security office while operating their computers and communication devices .
a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , the authorities issued an order to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages .
sleep or death , Part 1 : all scre@@ ams after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world you are looking at yourself and make sure that you are alone in a place where all important things have van@@ ished .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both inside and outside .
one that makes all the glory to her name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
but if reality cat@@ ches you back and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actors , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries out after death .
all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even when the Earth is on the axis of the Un@@ healed . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone have built stone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough so I could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn my lesson &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proved his power over us , even destroying the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to sh@@ atter the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , only my own one .
for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city which is stu@@ ffed up to the arter@@ ies with state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art safety organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces .
in the third night things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply stopped in the quarter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I interrupted the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed by silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a grand picture that filled my expectations whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly .
at such a moment you are aware that you are liber@@ ating the spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prepare , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed them all the way to the security service office from the body .
I arrived there .
Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear you scre@@ aming Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar , or you are only courageous enough to scre@@ am when we &apos;re not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes turned to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure about my case when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed thing lies in my nose to this day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was subjected to months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with myself .
then back through the yard and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I would like to take care of all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I must share it with only one other prisoner and I am allowed to sit straight away without waiting for her permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I went back to a tried @-@ and @-@ tested communication method : to beat the fist against the wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ s@@ th@@ ä@@ ft@@ ling &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a distinguished man of middle age , who looks like me and is called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the doctor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total darkness , no prominent features can be seen in me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to my voice ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I stay .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s , which refresh at the fruits in the garden of my head .
from afar , I still hear her scre@@ aming &quot; Al@@ la@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams will be heard each day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th of the Koran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to protect the state security against us and prevent us from expos@@ ing the tra@@ itor and terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ card and betra@@ yed the narrow field of view of their world@@ view .
this is not a house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the inter@@ rog@@ ation room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he happens to me that way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can get so much more important with your life than to join this Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ ah and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches after a friendly chat for me have become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished , though I had done nothing to earn this penalty .
on punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ aca .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices at your scre@@ ams .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him , and you cannot hold back your cry .
my cries were not enough for him , which is why they exchanged the pipe through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator had worked earlier than a tr@@ ash collector or if that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and found no pleasure in it , which is why he attacked an electrically charged staff .
electricity f@@ lowed my whole body enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my naked body , stretched out on the floor , was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say this was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry about terrible worries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he locks to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and also to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to escape from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : farmers ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , confron@@ ting the conservative majority and questioning its tried @-@ and @-@ tested opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these themes are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t admit it openly , he h@@ ates a special dis@@ incl@@ ination against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian @-@ wing@@ ed second generation &quot; - this is what he calls himself , even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine .
&quot; I don &apos;t think so much about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while pouring in water Nes@@ café po@@ unded in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically the lo@@ ins speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ ad@@ rons of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily talk about freedom .
sometimes Jordan is like a free @-@ air prison , especially if you take a look at neighboring countries .
therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Ministry of Interior Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an interview with CN@@ N , the dep@@ u@@ ties and former press spokes@@ persons of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism which raises the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be simple rhet@@ oric , but actually mirr@@ oring an increasingly clear , cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by educ@@ ating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust .
over the past few years , the number of &quot; Ehren@@ brei@@ de &quot; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it is ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on the crime of crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of inner @-@ family violence can &quot; be held in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; and for their release , many years of bureaucratic expendi@@ tures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing .
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is famous for not shy away from issues that have long been considered t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been advoc@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tac@@ kles the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which you can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bian and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to mem@@ ori@@ ze that his comments were torn out of the context , twisted and had been cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed up but only a processed version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b openly acqu@@ ires the Arabic LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not express Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century who still remains in his memory thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later was supposed to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ i@@ tical kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association , stating that they had critically commented on comments in social media that are related to the corruption rooted in the country .
in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ b concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
Jordan has denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the way of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - is made up of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad .
he not only dreams of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing it . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced cra@@ cies . at least he hopes it .
until that time , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and , consequently , resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
one susp@@ ects that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ u . another theory states that the ar@@ rests , drums and dancing were passed over more than a thousand years and from a time when armies from the west inv@@ aded Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ i , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab a few great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition at W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two ar@@ rests are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way of spending his summer :
&quot; Y@@ at@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fes@@ tivity was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against scissors and straight raz@@ ors

often external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , because they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the bar@@ ber .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where road and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
at the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers , who can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there are experts from each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( see the Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os public Facebook profile for more videos on current competitions ) .
educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , have an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to get a training in hair@@ dressing art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
before the school year beginning in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes :
in 1995 , we were the only specialised school in the municipality and the district , where we are very proud , because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children .

why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled ?
this is exactly what the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os of the Young Youth Foundation was no longer inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired the young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters .
it was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC guer@@ ri@@ lla movement , which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
in front of the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock , must now back into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take up its ranks and support them in building up a new life .
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colum@@ bians would unite and would have to help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter who is to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this stated that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , which needed most urgent attention .
thus came the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former F@@ ARC fighters who now find their place in society and have to build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were submitted on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo von der Stiftung Bo@@ got@@ Art travelled to the camp to personally convey the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up in such a way as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but a letter full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between , &quot; explained the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience as follows :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ ll@@ as live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ eg@@ row@@ er , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone has written to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote me something like that , so I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him quite firmly and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
perhaps he was tired of the war , was tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this warri@@ or , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside which is waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I have learned only how to deal with weapons .
but now where there is peace , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
at the outset , students and some of the leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to form a discussion round .
the students were all raised up as already war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state labor@@ ed on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
to hear those people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated , even people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives is painful to me .
but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter :
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that after dis@@ ar@@ ming peace would reign .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , healthcare and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to weapons , to stand up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now rel@@ ying on peace , a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all the def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about persec@@ utions in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and life in front of Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ h@@ owa and whose first publication took place on the website OC Media .
gay and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region face a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat that hangs over the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not yet come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual wife from Gro@@ z@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that addressed the spread , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities arrested by suspi@@ cious qu@@ eer men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the ch@@ ase was opened on Sab@@ rina .
from fear of her life she moved to the USA in the end .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend of Da@@ gest@@ an , a Trans@@ woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he was a friend , made a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this dis@@ grace ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App .
on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was about to fetch a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a man &apos;s voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here &apos;s a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but nothing hurt me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long will you honor the family , you shame ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the last analysis in the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started shou@@ ting .
the man fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which wings were you laid - in the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is still my male name on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
for this I am very grateful to him .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he was respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all was a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said to me that I must prove it by going up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my sex , that everything was just bad news , and Phot@@ os@@ hop .
I have body size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some older people once spoke my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you must disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
my mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved her .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , a car with a dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a plate of 95@@ cm stood under the window .
after it had happened for the third time , it became clear to me that something was la@@ zy .
my human rights activists checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with their help I left the country , but then something unbelievable happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
I bought it without registering myself , without notice , without knowing everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it in the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; don &apos;t you think you were safe , just because you left the country ?
our people know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC media : do you still have contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : just with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o theme .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish I can &apos;t overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I actually struggle to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who has eaten in ar@@ gun one and a half months .
he said that during the Ram@@ adan no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait , and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
so I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men still det@@ ained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there are not so many .
if , then above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to turn to Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked some village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , they were specifically immersed in order to radi@@ cal@@ ise themselves .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken with him .
up to now , however , they have not been presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non@@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think , already before 2003 , I was already known throughout Gros@@ ny when I still lived there - and I had never had any problems .
seriously , seriously !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was applied , I had never had any problems .
on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia originally intended to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but finally dump@@ ed us back to the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes and shorts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never cur@@ bed me one hair either . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several banks stood and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a saying in the Che@@ chen language : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted , and never beaten .
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped onto the plan .
when he became Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to speak about morality on television .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless , one could feel how people began to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic deterior@@ ated steadily .
OC Media : what action are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a sort of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t have a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ ap@@ per@@ ated influ@@ enza .
I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no ga@@ ys with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ inet@@ inians have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
here I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during the Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
you know , many think at Transi@@ denti@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
there has been a strong increase in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ eng@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and wish to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had det@@ on@@ ated himself .
some people managed to extingu@@ ish the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani Hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything .
he died shortly thereafter .
it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ ra@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - started .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family patri@@ arch@@ s who felt hel@@ pless and in@@ capable of feeding their families and pursuing a safe work due to the persecution of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy acquired power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable lands for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of that wealth .
it is often the victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and priv@@ ations .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are surrounded .
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused in the region by drought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi subjects now rose to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who were looking for a job completed primary school , 55 % finished secondary school leaving a university degree of 45 % .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the present situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi .
the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans newly arriving in Ah@@ wa@@ z and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process :
since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ tend to hire Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to comp@@ el them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their names and sur@@ names in order to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes .
given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights def@@ enders attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is in@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism ? &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me , why I should be a feminist and why we should be all fem@@ inists in general .
for example , women nowadays still earn less money than men despite the same education .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender still moves across the many different countries and beliefs .
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them .
I am a black woman .
and yet , if I come to terms of skin color , rac@@ ism , black c@@ is women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; when I mention the way we have always been ab@@ used physically , emotion@@ ally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to hold their silence .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices &quot; and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to argue that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of racial violence that we are subjected to in two ways black women .
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as a white girl due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to consider ine@@ qualities in her mind , which refer both to sex and to the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech in 18@@ 51 : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical point of view a bad and margin@@ alized nature .
I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their ego@@ centric program .
I will no longer try to suggest white women to suggest the importance of over@@ lap of skin colour and gender . some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement Tot@@ als , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than setting myself up for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ anism : Rec@@ la@@ iming ( example : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we re@@ conquer ourselves ) speaks of being able to defend ourselves by defining our own way . and not only that - black women can thus be worshipped in this way also the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures , as I exist in this paradigm .
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman .
I , a black woman , can blossom in an environment in which my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that is in@@ particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled again and again in the past seven years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a particular concern from Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ front Iraq , a subsidiary of Water@@ keepers Alliance , who works to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work on a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
this video was filmed , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work is on persecuted , un@@ noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative video and new multimedia techniques , with which aid supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way .
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women portra@@ y &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on the women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by structural . &quot; &quot; &quot;
most of the names have been changed to protect the persons affected .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who was violent opposite her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files , but they couldn &apos;t do more .
when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena was indic@@ ted for abuse , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez &apos;s suspi@@ cious announcement was useless .
a few days later , the second woman returned her ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women are ever ref@@ using to report , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence have to report to the prosecution authorities at all .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Stri@@ ke and statisti@@ c 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that lacks none of Paragu@@ ays statutes : good base , inadequate implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ ms , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are al@@ arm@@ ingly .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads were set up in the District At@@ tor@@ ney &apos;s Office for domestic violence . 70 % of them were violence against women .
86 % of ads in police came from women .
there were over 5000 displays because of domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here as well .
in the adver@@ ts , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse .
these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister , Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are two women who do not do this because of physical abuse , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , law enforcement agencies cannot adequately record how many women are killed each year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psych@@ ic force on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious :
I would never have thought that I would become a victim of abuse once .
when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment would at least have a certain complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating her .
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything began with mental ill @-@ treatment .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat her .
Victoria &apos;s adver@@ ts with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , they received no support .
it led a process against its former partner , who developed into an un@@ en@@ for@@ ce@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it mainly concerned money , power and influence of its former partner .
Paragu@@ ays &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way of resist@@ ances and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Un@@ less ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law envis@@ ages that Fem@@ izi@@ d should be declared an independent criminal offen@@ se and punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the wording of the law has been changed in some ways in order to also win the dep@@ u@@ ties for the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is banned , currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the original draft law fores@@ ees most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence currently have to carry on themselves , if they simply need to pay a complaint and wish to receive a safe accommodation , to impose the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it :
in Paraguay , mal@@ treatment is seen as part of inter @-@ human relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts are complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators get out of their way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reimbur@@ se as long as abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the bill was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
the opinions on the changes are diver@@ gent .
the Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law , however , is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by structural . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman one year after a newspaper ban continues to attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked because of a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the British authorities closed the independent arab@@ ic newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , serving a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and brought to court but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power following a coup d &quot; é@@ tat with his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur .
since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the harsh efforts of the security forces , in particular the domestic secret services , the civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of the press , restric@@ ting and torture human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , even activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to the freedom of the press in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties involved in the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
in the report , government officials were accused of putting pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in an inheritance dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the front page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Board of Commission@@ ers , was invited from ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS seized the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief , You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper is prohibited on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the trial in Mas@@ kat .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were condemned , inter alia , for dis@@ ruption of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
moreover , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year ban on profession was imposed on the two journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year imprisonment and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of the use of &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a security deposit of $ 5000 was fixed ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i at a hearing on 26 December 2016 . however , al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment for Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after losing his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison , serving his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
in spite of the decision of the Court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper still faces attacks by the Ottom@@ an government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with what the minister once again filed against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper .
the perpet@@ ual shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which in recent times the freedom of the press has been viol@@ ated .
further violations include , for example , the closure of the site of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ ina and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease operations .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the authorities to :
1 . let Al @-@ Ha@@ j be released immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . in all circumstances , ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including legal ch@@ ic@@ anes .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association as well as the right to gather , support and provide protection .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment to research these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
second , the research conducted by African scientists will help build up their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , when the AIDS epide@@ mic showed first serious implications for national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the sam@@ ba health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no fundamental research here . we only focus on solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being self @-@ cre@@ ators .
the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the US and Europe .
the projects are supported differently well .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries .
GV : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already an interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GV : how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this .
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system means that magazines are only accessible for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , which also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change food production worldwide
this contribution by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding salads since the 1980s .
his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ standing Gor@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only through its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 it re@@ marked that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents tend not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or caps . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate expon@@ ent of a millen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding salad , but meanwhile it takes longer , because his work is increasingly complicated by ever increasing restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to shrink . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads .
and if they stand trial , no one can breed a new salad type , because all the features are already patented . &quot; he continues to do as good as possible and tries to extract the characteristics he wants .
however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he also joined a movement that is growing in the USA and all over the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tube salad of the variety Out@@ standing Gor@@ geous in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot; &quot; &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders .
in the context of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can bind themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them .
&quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed them , to breed their own varieties , and not to cut it straight away - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ rons .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection .
seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg says that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all species of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grains , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over seeds , &quot; the recent examples are the amal@@ gam@@ ation of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer . &quot; whoever is offered good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables , should also know that the way in which this vegetables are grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available free of charge , as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics .

O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus always available is un@@ ce@@ asing to shrink .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all of the cart@@ on characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeders at all or only difficult .
there are still no such estimates for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are still patented as let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson C@@ arly S@@ ca@@ duc@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity .
it contradic@@ ts , however , that intellectual property is owned by other breeders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant variations foster innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection therefore does not prevent innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees the other : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to grow crops that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you have already lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive for us .
we want to make work easier for farmers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in total , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of patented plant characteristics : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves .
the plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state of O@@ reg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; if you breed a variety , you also breed its own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with great cour@@ ty@@ ards and mono@@ cultures , are required for their cultivation of mass her@@ bi@@ cides , breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such who move on international markets but are smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) , the majority of smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they refuse to pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both are the case .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I constantly need new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; open source &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Association Agre@@ col is working on an open @-@ source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union .
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , so O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s commitment is not simply to be one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it contradic@@ ts the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the &quot; Open Source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a worldwide Alliance for Open Source seed systems for the scheduled next year &apos;s official launch .
a consortium of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , has published a report from aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a relationship that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon recognize him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly been paid to where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role in this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make it clear to people that even more is behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government closed the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information website ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities were sharply critic@@ ised and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it has never been as important as now .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , for example the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of site blocking to the victim fell . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main data sources of human rights in Arab language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no longer access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of articles and articles which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
now the blog , which he directed to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , became the target of an attack .
B@@ logger , the provider in which the blog is located , is still accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video about how the police practiced physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what it means to him :
to lock blo@@ gs is very old but in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi priority ; and even if the blo@@ gging of blo@@ gs may not be meaningful for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege ; An arrest , an attempted murder , an invitation to the National Security Council , the blocking of blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I was working .
2 ) They have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post items to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
now , however , after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the brave go the way to the end .
according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 6 August . this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of vendors , which was possible by transferring internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users may have access to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can act against these acts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants fight .

day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil describe with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bing pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tim@@ er sends 8,@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ far@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest status in Rio for 10 years .
the Brazilian Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now being published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything that devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : that is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four minute video sharing on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper announced that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ruin in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes more :
we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , if distorted , can also be used to cover the atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; damage more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to punish those responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as indicated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ pleasing neg@@ lect of public service .
as a reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital .

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ites per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is owned by Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia points out , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for many years .
this security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by using a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ing one unit .
in the beginning , this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths . but after several years the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux cited one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not match the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use means and routes that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civil war is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; irr@@ ational balls . &quot;
war back or forth , fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
a week later , the police cleared the mountain with F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho in order to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident was head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : besi@@ eg@@ ed Syrians learn to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to Siege Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organisation PA@@ X and the Syria Institute research institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpet@@ rated .
since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege , leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smu@@ g@@ gled food .
thanks to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the common foods in Syria and are extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to AF@@ P , the French news agency :
&quot; we decided to cultivate fung@@ i , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years it has been fighting to make known this project and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more publicity . &quot;
to raise funds for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families of knowledge about planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la leads to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ do until Monday , 4th September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced plastics are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : break of siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spreading of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) to produce new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many neighbour@@ hoods in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that ra@@ ced in the North of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two persons died and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government issued a national agreement last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 volcanic erup@@ tions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occ@@ ured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
according to the European Forest Monitoring System , which monitors the forest areas by satellite images , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
all of Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al of the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão there were roads and villages for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do so anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with high risk of fire are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal on the roll form introduced by the government in 2003 and 2005 was obj@@ ected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law which allowed the construction activity of the case if the applicant had a means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val exec@@ utes in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continue to spread to fires of this kind .
in addition to these problems , the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when residents looked for information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it uses the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial in this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers could not resist the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits .
even the founder asked for help :

in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan by the Tali@@ ban began .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups defe@@ ating the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a land of terror and despair .
at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother didn &apos;t say it then , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was to break up .
his un@@ cle would fetch him and bring him to the hau@@ lers .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ oo , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many haz@@ ara were suddenly p@@ am@@ pered .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was found again in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal pit . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself , in order to earn his living .
back then , like today , Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; recalls A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked .
there were no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows , so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without official papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af returned to Italy in 2002 .
some time ago , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed meals to people in need twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high twin ratios , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers . however , it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country find are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special reception centres . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and so did A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ brid@@ led manner of living helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having worked for several years in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af set up his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles .
according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans run business , including dres@@ s@@ making , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells of the different Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy .
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a s@@ ushi restaurant in Rome also have Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s objectives extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity .
he has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans in this way .
citizen report : Egypt &apos;s draft bill to shut down social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in prison for more than 900 days .
he reported about the evacu@@ ation of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ v@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ tizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority &apos;s website stating their full name and identity number .
those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the removal of a penalty .
the Act , which was applied by 60 members of Parliament , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , a further MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce stric@@ ter sanctions for the insul@@ t of the president or a high officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under the law , however , such an act would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy would be punished .
if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was captured on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the im@@ pe@@ achment of elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si .
like more than 700 cont@@ est@@ ants who had been arrested during the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan waited four years in jail for a trial date .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to the 20th of May , because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room .
Sha@@ w@@ kan faces death penalty on account of one , so many human rights groups agree on , including weapons possession , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal tri@@ bunal in G@@ iz@@ a was acqu@@ itted by the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ishments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
inter@@ rog@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists to scanned documents
in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly inter@@ rog@@ ated to a broken action plan . said plan comes from the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supports a controversial draft bill , which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali who accused corruption of am@@ nesty if they return all the illeg@@ ally received funds .
the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on 21 April sheds light on how presidential plans are to support the bill .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia refused to nom@@ inate his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
in spite of this , he appeared as a witness in the District Court in Tunis on May 9th .
does China want to force users of social media to present their badges ?
according to the new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need approval before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the regulations that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suggest that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ comm@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Organis@@ ator of Information Dis@@ semination &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a law dated 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request for the termination of user data .
these web pages currently include websites such as V@@ kontakte and Od@@ no@@ class@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court decre@@ es Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as barrier in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications said the site was closed because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information source collabor@@ ating with groups to promote a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked its website . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
United Kingdom can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
once this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that Internet service providers would comp@@ el to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor applications that encryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted t@@ elec@@ oms companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
