<seg id="1">Although I visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and operated his sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the supreme Federal Court with judges who were inclined to his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free according to Method Man," "" "I was like the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA only strengthened.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very fanatical love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never stops behind the mountain, as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people reacted to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in Republican Pre-elections was the highest number ever achieved by the party nominated by the party.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which takes people from all over the world, a deep-believing person with whom I was able to talk about Islam and its past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" playing.</seg>
<seg id="25">Bumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">She still fits in with the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump had guessed his way to nominated republican presidential candidates, they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The discussion with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful, and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that those voters who are most white have voted for Trump because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to lift a man looking down with contempt upon those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "whitelash" "" "(remark of the Ü): as much as" "" "white revolt against all other ethnicities" "". "" "" "white and whiplash tone" "", "which means" "" "big Van Jones" "", "has killed exactly what America has done so great." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background one may always have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyuan, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With Donald Trump, however, a huge part of the white America gives up this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a talk with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "" "" "no!" "" "the crowd shouted." ""</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices were louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "could someone who is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trump Land, the message said.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">The fact that the music played in both places not only has changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located at the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome poverty.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse of drugs and the use of gangs.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">You always come laughing and with shining eyes and play in the hustle and bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from trash</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village located virtually on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments made of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers began under the leadership of Favio Chávez in order to turn parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion all made out of waste.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash The children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something that he had never seen before: a violin made of waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments made of recycled material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic Mülllandfill) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">Every year, the world produces about one billion tons of waste.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">The Philharmonic Orchestra follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra played his music even before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publishing happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberian waters before it sought the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and little inclined to welcome a lawbreaker of this kind on their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were quickly mobilized against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to permit him fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "" "Benedict Kiilu, a senior manager of the Kenyan fisheries authority. he is part of a team who discovered and pursued the ship at the time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not successful for him to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Finally, it was also forced to pay $2 million to Liberia due to pillage of fish stocks in the country.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was founded by FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network, alongside Somalia and Madagascar, are the six countries that the prime minister had driven out of their waters back then.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "they exchange information and stand up for illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, therefore it is extremely difficult to trace. this makes illegal fishing a major cause of overfishing of regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once hampered by bureaucratic hurdles, and also by the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, the actions happen nowadays in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also attentively follows the activities of ships when they move on the open sea by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that are fishing in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship is inviting its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries opposed to illegal fishing may, on the basis of this information, refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay sanctions, as in the case of the Premier.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer profitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and that's what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, senior director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform has been created to attract an estimated $20 million in lost revenues, which lose the eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of illegal fishing that invade East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these illegal fishing fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include sailing under false flag, bogus license papers, specifying fantasy names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You can't run my harbor'." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i now." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front has been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that shared fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and found and found addictive ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share and preserve information about illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very clever techniques to hide their activities and their position. and this is what we try to cross," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers FISH-i technical support." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships switch off, for example, their automatic identification systems, so they can't be located any more from satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i to find criminally active ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence this unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protection Organisation: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed worldwide by means of the location of each tracking vessel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who's doing what is happening - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to pool their resources for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals, but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to fish earlier without a license and hardly had to reckon with consequences, now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries involved in FISH-i have now recorded a 33% increase in fishing turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped Somalia detect Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we are a study object." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "in 2015, six countries have joined forces, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "" "" "Security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "" "Copeland says." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce its first major triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship that was sailing under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a license and used drag nets, which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship has also penetrated into forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "taking measures against Greko 1 set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protect the oceans actually works across the oceans.

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the request of the opposition to a referendum on the removal of the government, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (e.g.: the refunds of Venezuela) can be found both by these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also being conducted in other parts of the country - among others in the Barinas area, in the Andes regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central-northern Bundestaat Carabobo and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is deteriorating continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medication.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change in the impeachment of the current President Nicolás Maduro; in the end, however, the attitude of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne Díaz, contributors at Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision in her latest article as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rate belong to the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% of the annual financial statements) and in which there is a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine, the referendum on the disposal of many was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance called Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (about: round table of the Democratic Unit), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly.</seg>

<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo Gómez with Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on Día a Día, an Argentinian news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to see the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of Córdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man, Quijano is now in the area of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Córdoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial concluded on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in the prison La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept the family secret for himself.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child at the age of 15, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a gendarmerie. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a period of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the intelligence division 141 in La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>
<seg id="211">Archive recording.</seg>
<seg id="212">This is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor, who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>

<seg id="346">Edited the original photos by Joshua Levine.</seg>
<seg id="347">In the Kyoto city Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving licence, witnessed a particularly mischievous translation during the last month.</seg>
<seg id="348">"" "the Japanese word is represented on a shield, which means" "" "older drivers" "", "wrongly, but perhaps also with malicious hind and # 8212; translated as" "" "terrible motorists" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been divided in many ways in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a citizen of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun, published in the Kyoto Protocol, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it come to such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation corrected.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "Holmes said." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">"" "the faulty English translation was first removed. the term" "" "terrible drivers" "" "was later replaced by the appropriate, although grammatically not quite correct term" "" "elder drivers" "" "(German:" "" "older drivers" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="357">The Kyoto police apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported the following about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we sincerely apologize that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News featured a bit more detailed with the phenomenon of "dreadful" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older drivers who have been involved nationwide in accidents is quite a matter of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 accidents in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, seniors caused 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased their share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">While the number of accidents in total has sunk, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period.</seg>
<seg id="366">The specifically unnamed reporter brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo, showing what prejudices some Japanese apparently cherish against older drivers:</seg>
<seg id="367">The article on the translation error of Yahoo, among other things, received the following comments:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active command of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the belief that translators should be native speakers in the target language - not in the initial language.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as their native language, which may produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies, who do not have foreign employees themselves, can still produce translations within the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English skills are valued as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The verbose and enigmatic sentences generated by mechanical translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is particularly true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, among them the mysterious prints that often adorn t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. however, by large companies or by the government, which have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more accurate translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">"" "main page of the" "" "Navegar con Libertad" "" "(Free Surfing) of IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute of Press and Society)." ""</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, April 7, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they would not have access to the Vivoplay online transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organized by oppositional groups that oppose the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the tasks of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was chapped, and recommended the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Censorship: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Facilities such as Vivoplay are popular with Internet access, especially in times of turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report on protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission threatened them with fines and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw it as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels I signed up at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">Amazing that this is still more favourable than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsinfiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS), but also two more on-line stations.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS servers respond to specific domain requests.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds poorly or denies the request by calling on such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS barrier: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third-locked channel, the broadcast was discontinued on Thursday, April 6, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was arrested.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten, while he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">He was released eight hours later, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates the internet connections, making it more difficult for Venezuelans to access multimedia reports on current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard the owner of the house full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one from which something has become," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old, she began working as a crimp for the family. as a crimta, in Paraguay the more than 46,000 boys and girls forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money survives her underage son or her underage daughter to another, richer family. in exchange, the child receives food, a training and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">However, what is not mentioned is that the children have to work for a number of days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract you cannot lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice called Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay owing to the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a number of years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Crimean ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name things by name, as the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated with the crimta guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," "" "explains Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, there is the family, whose daughter is in faith that she can complete her education, improve her position in society and "make something out of herself" to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who assimilates the girl and whose exploitation with faith justifies that they give someone a chance otherwise would not receive education and maybe even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">When the girl is mistreated, his family will experience it many years later.</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the hidden in Paraguayan households, has a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina Marín was hospitalized in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of intense punches. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criadita in the household of the former military personnel, Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt.</seg>
<seg id="439">Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small village with just 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira attacked Marín as long as she suffered deadly injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported about the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a crimp.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF and Callescuela were responsible for the practice of the Criadazgo, deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society, for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They described the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there should be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"more cows are registered in Paraguay as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children without impunity.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under what conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the married couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a quick investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her crimson.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina Marín could be indicative - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Crimean ta</seg>
<seg id="455">The Crimean tas are exploited not only as workers but also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, where her father worked, had to join bankruptcy and her father lost his job.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work and began selling sweets on the street or on the market to earn money.</seg>
<seg id="458">They all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción in Crivanta.</seg>
<seg id="460">Alvarenga worked in her employer's house between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>

<seg id="469">In some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorials from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay, changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians have recently agreed to draft legislation on "regulating the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "" "" "when adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt must register with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter." ""</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "" "" "on the basis of the law a place would then be set up, which is assigned to give citizens a permit to use social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law, users must have their right names and identity numbers registered on the website in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months "imprisonment or a fine of money.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, which consists of six paragraphs and curses in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs over the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video content and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted as the draft gives no indication of how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose their registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies.</seg>
<seg id="509">Riyad Abdul Sattar, member of parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall blocking Facebook. "</seg>
<seg id="510">This could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of this it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network.</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>

<seg id="513">"" "Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" "" "senior researcher" "" ") of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), said Global Voices:" ""</seg>
<seg id="514">I strongly doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding matters that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">In my opinion, they imagine that just as they could physically control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online.</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "if I take it seriously, it means that they will set up a strong monitoring system to filter out citizens who apply for authorisation or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to supply them to a court process." ""</seg>
<seg id="517">Technically, this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "" "" "to be passed as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate." ""</seg>
<seg id="519">Whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in the parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and that no dissenting narration is present on the image surface, "says Raoof.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists of the non-governmental organisation Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian Leopard.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subtype of the larger family of leopards strikes through Africa and Asia belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered because of Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of its habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "The Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian Leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video therefore finds that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a biologist, Raza passionately likes to portray a different side of her country, which is not just out of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">Since 2013, it has also been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group and is committed to ensuring that protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdistan region are set up.</seg>

<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the responsible daily Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was a number of prefectures in Japan's northeast that had both experienced the earthquake and the resulting tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighborhoods Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate, because the tsunami had left entire coastal cities away from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture saw a nuclear accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view what progress has been achieved six years after, in order to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics of the Japanese rebuilding as well as survey results of the affected people themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare-homes (for the time being) were completed in the prefectures Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate.</seg>
<seg id="552">The biggest success among the three prefectures was reported by Miyagi, where 80 percent of the planned replacement parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">However, even six years after the catastrophe, evacuated the evacuation of accomodation units (vastly, Kazaketsu juutaku) to resettle in final substitutions.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of those who evacuated Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuations, who were hauling after the disaster in temporary shelters, were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number here is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 out of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened its doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools in the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and nuclear accident have affected large areas in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"" "it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of 5400 hectares of destroyed farmlands by Fukushima are located in the" "" "nuclear zone of blocking" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima remains far back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal dwellers found it harder to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuations. it questioned them about the state of rebuilding and how their empathy has changed against the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition on the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also directed her attention to the situation of the evacuations from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to witness not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness of the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160 000 evacuations from Fukushima, nearly 63,000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016, more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been relocated to permanent spare houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">After the state of 2017 there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes most of the evacuations are older than 50 years old. it is known to be able to get back in proper dwellings because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima must compete with massive construction projects. this is a construction project that is part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries that speak a different language, the differences seem to be larger than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while one often detects that one connects more than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, let's look at these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast, we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veronika Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love of music overcame her affection for the Iranian culture; Adriana Macias talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, notwithstanding that there is no noteworthy sugar harvest on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years since the activities were paralysed in the sugar cane factories.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities, until only the steel and concrete scaffolding remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 a.m., the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive period are back into operation because they were preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene remembers to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane sugar factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The message would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a novelty.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete and hardly competitive, they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only allowed the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis in the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose again a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 cent must remain a pound, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organization.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go into history," "" "these were the first words of the Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on October 21, 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavando." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the decommissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane plant Gregorio Arlée Mañalich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto Pérez worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats the most is" "" "deceit" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters started.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially authored documents which would be distinguished only with respect to the parts that would be removed, the address and date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on the responsibility was postponed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the abandoned factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still operating in operation," he assures.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another plant, Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>
<seg id="666">He was involved in the shutdown of the factory, in whose construction he helped.</seg>
<seg id="667">With every part he removed, he dismantled one of his 31 years of work.</seg>
<seg id="668">The most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important work bench producer has been wiped out.</seg>
<seg id="669">In many cases, there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated by the plants in the congregations in which they were located.</seg>

<seg id="675">When the sugar cane sugar factory closed, or rather, when they began to dissociate it, they also stopped to grasping the road, this disadvantaged also other factories.</seg>

<seg id="692">Youth of the First Nations communities throughout Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it using hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile audio studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop is thus increasing that the young participants explore topics such as "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self acceptance" or whatever comes into mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other first Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of Winnebago in the U.S. state Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the trunk of the Kitsumeb First Nation in British Columbia tells, for example, the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of Tears," a street section in Western Canada, where almost two dozens of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">Most of the cases were not solved.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youngsters did not always command the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain will be sung on cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from Northmovie Hip-Hop-Gruppe, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available as well as a translation into English which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on earth</seg>
<seg id="707">That is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise ourselves one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and move forward with our youth.</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended the Creator for.</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary section, the reader and proponent of the Cree language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse in syllabus (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan, you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru ("" "" Plastic models of the dishes "" "") are exhibited by any food that is served in this restaurant. "" "</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers will see these kinds of plastic dishes and decide whether to enter or continue the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo suburb of Kappabashi, there are a large number of small companies producing plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented over 20 years ago in his film Tokyo-Ga.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend nowadays turns them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin repuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile phone bands decorated with plastic dishes as they are shown at the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food delivery is becoming increasingly complicated.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as mobile phone stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phones allow you to make your own work of art. in this case ikura or Lachsrogen is used, a popular topping, served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">More bizarre plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow us on Twitter the hashtag #...</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the city of Kappabashi, which dedicates itself to the pleasure of the restaurant industry. for example with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the missing and killed often only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The report on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the bereaved or the communities that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind every bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">Therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político started the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "to live with drug trafficking"), to give these sacrifices a voice and tell stories of people who were engaged in the battle between law enforcement and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime not only makes us afraid of our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities therefore need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video titled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear lives" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret graves after his son every weekend.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two her nephews on just one day.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves for the task we have set ourselves, to go away and search for tombs, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="770">At the moment, she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">You stand for the assurance of my father, but it does not pay them out because they demand a death certificate.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of Aprender a vivir con el Narco explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the leadership of the state." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in Central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I've known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">Every day I pass by newspaper kiosks and see the titles of titles with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from acts of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as though I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) if he's big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they walk through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "people's selflessness is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being" "" "soaked." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to argue that they are spared from such tragedies if they do not stir and remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the capital district: how a family has been looted with threats." it describes how armed criminals blackmailed money from their business month by month until they had destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We will only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested because they don't know when they will lead or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself if wines would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I have forgotten how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation signed by violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it possible to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care for them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is a orphan and he tells him that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make Chichi for the babies living with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence was violated by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the councillor for public security and the government of the Government of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the prosecutor's office amounted to 3103 deaths. this corresponds to 8.5 Mordes per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organised crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we must not forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal Político created the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tormented the country over the last four decades in an understandable way.</seg>

<seg id="820">Let us take this picture of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release it has been misleading to depict tragedies that actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not negate the fact that there is ample careful reporting about events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted around and exploded. 230 people died there.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous pathways full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tanker fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball, which enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby, full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses burned and burnt corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to be unrecognizable.</seg>

<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies, lined up on the floor while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been intercepted several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically of atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in roads and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">Reports were reported, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one left behind to count bodies," "" "said a Human Rights Watch resident." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the following time could be depicted figuratively.</seg>
<seg id="844">The occasion for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Boko Haram's attempt to gain land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo resurfaced when it was falsely presented as evidence of the fact and possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">This is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of abortions; Africa Check has been documenting orders to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a proof of mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Another step further brings personal comments like this example falsely the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to supply arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The picture of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Rohingya Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a lightning detection, published by the United Nations describes those who could flee to blows, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others of the violence against Rohingya reported, posts like the following appeared, bringing together those descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arabic news page, falsely claiming 2012 that the president's Thein Sein had said monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>

<seg id="909">This news page falsely claimed that the President of Myanmar Thein admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Rohingya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture of Sange.</seg>

<seg id="912">This article from 2014 about students who were killed by the Boko Haram, published by the recently deleted, Catholic close message of Análisis Digital, has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the killings, but it claims that it is a "similar jihadist attack."</seg>

<seg id="917">United States, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="918">The picture was weathered as evidence of the Boko Haram massacre in 2015 (and more than 9,300 times saved). but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context.</seg>
<seg id="919">Instead, the aim was to pay attention to the relative numbers of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">Vietnam (Chinese), 2014.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focused on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about silence related to the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">With social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Does this mood of false and false information suggest that actual atrocities are untrue and does the actual horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of forcible images has been debated in detail (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, worry is that violent images desensitise readers and viewers, and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, but it can also be used in the context of a completely misused way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how internationally they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. insurmountable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">These words exist in any language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known today (like the famous Portuguese Celdade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish Sobotesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or an expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes some context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's Mwotlap, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - strive for your parents in recognition as to how they worked for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunspoetical language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - the convenience or laziness that you feel after having warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">They defenceless other cultures, reveal other thought processes and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze and classify the world around us and classify the linguists on this page even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>

<seg id="970">The island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and landslide catastrophe in this decade.</seg>
<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually starts at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have trampled over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">According to an opinion from the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and almost 100 people are missing because of the floods and sludge avalanches.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe places of residence.</seg>
<seg id="974">Rainfalls slowed on Saturday (27 May), and the water levels in some areas slowly declined.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following pictures and videos convey an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">Floods in Taforama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users such as Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet provide regular updates to flood situations.</seg>

<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1003">People with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sahar they know - from the widespread concept of "Muslims," which has built up in their conception.</seg>
<seg id="1004">They had to limb me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">In our collective imagination, this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims, as I do not fit in, become unfit.</seg>

<seg id="1017">Islam, the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day when he died.</seg>
<seg id="1018">But in the Western imagination, the Rumi religion was wiped out, as well as the most popular translations of his poetry.</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a great part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body, these are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and unconsciously to consolidate the "other." as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the occupation that we have no president, the chocolate cake, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling stories, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to connect with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Initiative Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has been running events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided if we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces in which residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening frequently is connected with it," "" "these events instead" "" "listen to listening to cherish, feel, touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first expose their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their depiction lead to the audience's commitment to it.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as though the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional Burkina Faso story, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also seizes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of storytelling.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event, John Nyamaara tells the tale of the rabbit and the vian in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the importance of his fable, John Nyamus ara is asked:" "" "how to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling stories.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on April 3, 2017; the march started from the capital city of Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan.</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syriac-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, an event was dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, director of Book Sprints, produced finished books within three to five days, read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book, which was published last year and is available here license-free, contains a number of essays dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the Introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book aims to discuss how to build movement for free knowledge and what is the true cost associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked alongside page to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense of our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book entitled "Collective Memory" gives his friends and family a voice that is pushing for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for Open Source and Digital Activist has been in custody since March 2012 in the custody of Syrian government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown location from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "military police" had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that it had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 who themselves presented themselves as the insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, its whereabouts and condition remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded the bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basques's cultural prototypes were more provisionary than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilisations and here, Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not know that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it, embodying this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not yet conclude this project.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in jail:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my whole life dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write, and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a commission that she wrote to her husband during the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from the Arabian into English.</seg>

<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case where a government member returned after half of his prison sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">It is Dioino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, was sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants due to misappropriation of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, the Council of which has managed Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which rejected the request, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to refer to his old post, as the company did not fulfil any disciplinary proceedings after his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, CIP), in an interview with Deutsche Welle, condemned the company's decision to re-establish its director:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also have initiated a disciplinary action against the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company, however, apparently kept silent and made no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambique social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as "passive":</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant, after being sentenced to a prison sentence and half of it had subsided.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he has consented to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for its silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Not to the contrary!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not have any moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza failed to return to morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served itself only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was pre-loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was rewarded in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="1276">Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to recall that a thief is in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel not only to remain in the memory of the Mozambians as the first independent president, but also as sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">One of his most famous oral representations, when he testified energetically that "an ambitious man is capable of everything, also the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>

<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpeas or splits." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally use as adjective "Indies."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook zenzes the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "represented" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar" may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word have been censored for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalkamaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboosier Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he had asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a play of words.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The proposition ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Homs believes that it will reduce hate speech by radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before it destroys all posts that are suspected of spreading racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write to facbeak.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead is to carefully analyze the post and control it by checking the words opposite.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a pretty good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to all who propagate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, with the users of social networks simply starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new Facebook page, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, post and sharing content for 24 hours because the mail "did not conform to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions on hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author comments on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae khine believes Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring even greater hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"" "moreover, it seems as if they have started this without any local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as" "" "chair" "" "or" "" "peas curry" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has provided a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users are now joking about Facebook and deliberately write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the web.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts containing no hate language, but still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text is" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to check out if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post says" "" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the past five years extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speeches on his burgeal sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But rather than censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better in context than on code concentrating initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1346">"" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Convention on Child Rights, the minors as" "" "defined" "" "every person under 18 years of age." ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the country's statistical Central Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which endeavored to abolish laws for children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation to say the critics of the children's marriage, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition was causing tensions in this uncomplicated issue, and at some point doubts arose whether the opposition would agree with the draft law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the draft law against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must approve and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was approved in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and not one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously been approved by the Senate, the draft may now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws for children's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a minister of the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk that concealed the core of the matter, but do you know what? the children's marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was in the opinion, it took definitely long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public status update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been decided.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, votes - 35 for it - 0 against it!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Folade Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who openly spoke openly about how important the adoption of the law was, noted:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-ready age in Trinidad and Tobago now amounts to 18 years irrespective of the religious affiliation.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft on the change of the marriage network was adopted today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There were 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present in the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All parliamentarians, who were contrary, voted for the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The children's marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long struggle (...) # childadriageitordabuse.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all activists who fought him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Thanks to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organization in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal action, the law should be passed, and he seems to disintegrate his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al Rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users desired that the debate on the subject would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell proposed:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Rather, instead of speaking of the problem, instead of talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem that we, instead of speaking of the problem, would simply talk about the state that protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are opposed to them, "would you be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where children are legally or still the norm, although there are laws which prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The English-language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Law in the USA, internationally blacked.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has now closed the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful as well as reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many Internet users are used to using circumvention tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third-largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking an article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blocking of the Internet has been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (Nr. 5651) has been adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">According to China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform continues to remain closed, several mirror sites (sites that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated) are now displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform deposited all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. machine calculator connections), which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available, however, in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the messages (via Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content on a decentralized and distributed way.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when Wikipedia is locked in the respective country.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server further directs the request to the right wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself when it is locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is run by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">An sich Nashorn, Chitwan.</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with misplaced motifs and washed out colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivates him to wear a camera himself and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Nepal's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his home town next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when I suddenly called me Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge). he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from Sauraha tourist resort.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father watched him and showed me the place on the other river side, where the leopard was located and I immediately began kneeling pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition of Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know [it], for he was already facing Tigers face to face,</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep while sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">I too was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the king of the busiest appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at us and he stares at me through the scarf-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures of Otters in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photograph of birds living near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been republished here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women with the greatest care avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronouns or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, and fear of consequences should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha by a mock court and infringed by her family and the village community after she had contacted a married couple.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer admittances to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health personnel as well as housewives, joined a unique club and became the main topic of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the Community of Video Volunteers and advocates for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected people, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She tells us how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors for change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in her discussion group was women who did not name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open up a conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands aloud, is a custom that they all bear responsibility and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is seen as deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home as it runs.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round of her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him now by his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in the luggage, Rohini started her first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "Patriarchate" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands over their lips," said Rohini Pais from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she choked only before her during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in the adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at the name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law solidified her, she was afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini thought I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zincamber spot on the forehead, which shows the status of the marital status:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnobary point if he did it too.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose for themselves, not to carry it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at every discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what" "", "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never been so truthful about some things, for example, how our identities were attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say some things aloud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to the clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most this is okay, but some wanted to wear a Salad-Curta, a wide shirt above a pant; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After a lot of argument and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morals linked to the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled her own couple of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to take a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">On the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far, we have only taken small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, still do it, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnobert's red on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling about more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini declares:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th of this year, the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans shared memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, noted in 2016 on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just about five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">It became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," Ryuichi Isaka, President of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles Memorial Day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in English lessons at Japanese middle schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles outlive everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today is Beatles Memorial Day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should be John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the known places that are related to the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places you absolutely need to visit.</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of abduction of bald people for organ trafficking, presumably for disbelieving purposes, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was found decapitated and a part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth, declared the police spokesman at Zambézia of the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, are people with Albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight these superstitions and prejudices.</seg>

<seg id="1596">Beware of kahle men who travel to Mozambique as bald men in Mozambique are aiming for ritual attacks, warned the Mozambican police according to the latest killings of three bald men due to their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the killings took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and resident of the city of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police are already pursuing the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for probably abandoned rituals, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also acknowledges that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In the last few days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha informed the chronicle of the blogger poor Snaippa, who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty confronting Mosambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÖCHTE GERNE EIN Mocambik, THAT I ashamed A country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks, and would not even take their lives to make their bread, a country in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed for indulgent purposes or "black magic" are hunted that aim to get a quick fortune.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for macabre humour could not be missed.</seg>

<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the end of June.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009 Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion" (state endangerment), having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Liu's case as an" "" "internal affairs" "" "and a spokesman told that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nonetheless, China is still receiving calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, to release or allow him to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has put together a number of foreign reactions.</seg>

<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations had to exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway Affair Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about the release of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it had nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">The diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume exports to China, as exports were mostly blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Because of his imprisonment, he was not able to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union - European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to liberate Liu and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called for China to release Liu as she shared in an explanation on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect that China abolishes all limitations of Mr. Liu's wife and family members.</seg>

<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the news agency AFP on June 27 that the embassy requests the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the request of the US embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom such as freedom of movement and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they claim according to the Chinese constitution and legal system and international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I call on China to release Nobel laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally so that he can embark on a proper medical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany - Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin hoping that Liu will receive all the medical support he needs and that a humanitarian solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the top priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping appeared on the G20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns about whether the vortex of Liu might overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada and Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called on China to provide adequate health care to Liu and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu's lawyer told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always oversees the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to someone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada challenges China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and to release those rights to exercise these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Foreign Ministry called on China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in an explanation on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where. furthermore, his wife and his family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info has already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information if France will eventually record it.</seg>

<seg id="1674">Taiwanese lawgiver Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the sick intellectuals to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very worried about Liu in an explanation on June 28, and that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1682">License: CC0 Domaine Public</seg>
<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">It supports Singapore as a city to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the Blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifice to create this valuable land, we hear that ultimately we are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons mentioned by Shanamamalgam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he was inevitably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, cities that are permanently run by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre appears from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be Democrats, leaving the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, in the last week of Shanmugam the answers given to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system were really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He camouflaged corresponding questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng challenges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear this point as long as he was paid high in order to be part of the government of the City of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticisms that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore is more of a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the elections in Singapore are so uneven, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities have seen a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said" "" "Singapore is not a country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he is defending.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review discovers the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "Mr. Shanmugam" "" "committed a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only viewed as an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since it plays an important role within the Cabinet of Cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The periodical Journey of a Decade tends to affirm that Singapore is and has always been a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"" "" "" "I didn't say what I said..." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1730">This proposition seems to have angered many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "" "the defense of the country especially" "", "but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>

<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>

<seg id="1745">"" "my clarification usually follows the standard answer:" "" "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." "" "many Canadians maybe cook in rage if they are kept for Americans, but it doesn't bother me." ""</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians can attach a Canadian flag to their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>

<seg id="1767">"" "but there are also some problems with the stamp" "" "nice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, to be called "nice" is basically to be spooky - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has its own Canadian twin).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter.</seg>
<seg id="1771">To be harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far as to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major feature of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just a cool politeness.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open kindness which I now associate with my American friends.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band, famous in Thailand, has released a music video that preserves the Junta, which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, continues to dominate the country.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Ink describes a young man who tells him what regulations his girlfriend makes.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not explicitly political, the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days, the video uploaded onto Facebook was shared 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video "The Dictator" in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly in relation to the situation of the country under the junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these videos of the video that relate to some of the political topics that Thailand has persistently pursued over the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the preliminary constitution, which gives the commander-in-chief of the army absolute decision-making power over important national issues." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious program of changing journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons viewed by the Junta as critics." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was set up in the army which monitors online content and accused persons who were accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand sets out a strict protest against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic offense).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later, it was a putsch of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the junta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists are in prison because they allegedly have caused "confusion" in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences, they should insult the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the songs showed members of the band, who imitated the tribute of "The Hunger Games" which was already used by Putsch opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is run by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and gold coloured earrings in the form of a teddy bear.</seg>
<seg id="1902">It is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. however, they know many of the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For approximately 2.50 dollars per night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez says, the people come in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry: "Mama Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some also slept outdoors on cardboard.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when she is sick, she buys drugs that they cannot afford, she massaged them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make their first stop in South America and then move northwards.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Afrika." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are talking about Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, it began its journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards in order to save the money needed to buy the ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," "" "he said, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez says that her guests often send text messages when they go to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a blind alley leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family immigrated to their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I have experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>

<seg id="1945">"" "there are places where people can help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to blackmail money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single woman, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next steps.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the hallways, the travellers consult their phones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, most of them from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud Grandmother she leaves her album with many photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which they instruct the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message, it is said that the app" "" "prevents access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities had to use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture because, shortly after they installed the app, they had exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the communication of the police, the app was intended to identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangen's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, designed for minors, is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reporting on digital censorship in China mostly focuses on users' experiences in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority areas such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">In order to limit unrest and discontent in the areas of conflict, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine web shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">"" "the Twitter based media outlet" "" "Images from mainland China" "", "which publishes censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police officers were randomly checking whether they had installed the surveillance app." ""</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint using a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" also published a Jingwang product description from which it emerges that the software can raise the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus receives unlimited access to the computer's hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions affiliated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the cyber security office while operating their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an order to all residents and entrepreneurs until 1 August to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he locks to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and also to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to escape from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felahyeen (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist, confronting the conservative majority and questioning its tried-and-tested opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these themes are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria to Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and he can sympathise with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't admit it openly, he hates a special disinclination against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as a "Palestinian-winged second generation" - this is what he calls himself, even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think so much about my own circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so because I am a man" "", "while pouring in water Nescafé pounded in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the loins speak lukewarm coffee and the squadrons of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily talk about freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan is like a free-air prison, especially if you take a look at neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Ministry of Interior Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert announcement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "in an interview with CNN, the deputies and former press spokespersons of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism which raises the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be simple rhetoric, but actually mirroring an increasingly clear, crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender norms by educating his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of "Ehrenbreide" has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers reached its peak in 2016; however, it is aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on the crime of crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of inner-family violence can "be held in prison indefinitely," and for their release, many years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the part of the family are necessary for the woman to do nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs's music enjoys great popularity and is famous for not shy away from issues that have long been considered taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been advocated," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which you can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbian and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been censored until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to memorize that his comments were torn out of the context, twisted and had been censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed up but only a processed version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib openly acquires the Arabic LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not express Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century who still remains in his memory thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who later was supposed to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemitical kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former members of the government and members of the teacher association, stating that they had critically commented on comments in social media that are related to the corruption rooted in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the Hdaib concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">Jordan has denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the way of progress - that is Hdaib - is made up of slow, deliberate and inner changes. it is certain that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without interventions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He not only dreams of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness by means of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially induced cracies. at least he hopes it.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until that time, Hdaib will continue to rap and, consequently, resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohoku. another theory states that the arrests, drums and dancing were passed over more than a thousand years and from a time when armies from the west invaded Japan to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition at Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking at the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two arrests are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way of spending his summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yatemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# Summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebuchaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of a 18-metre-high festivity was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let's enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Often external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, because they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the barber.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where road and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the experienced hands of hairdressers, who can recreate these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There are experts from each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (see the Batalla de Barberos public Facebook profile for more videos on current competitions).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, have an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to get a training in hairdressing art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and opportunities, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">Before the school year beginning in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only specialised school in the municipality and the district, where we are very proud, because we have built up this educational community out of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to Guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Usage with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the edited version of the article" "" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" "", "which the international online magazine Tea After Twelve has published." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This is exactly what the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios of the Young Youth Foundation was no longer inspired by the Young Youth Foundation and inspired the young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">It was only recently that their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement, which forms the end point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">In front of the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock, must now back into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deep hatred for guerrilla fighters, must now take up its ranks and support them in building up a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Columbians would unite and would have to help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter who is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This stated that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, which needed most urgent attention.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus came the plan to write letters full of hope and support for former FARC fighters who now find their place in society and have to build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were submitted on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo von der Stiftung BogotArt travelled to the camp to personally convey the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up in such a way as they had previously done to accept the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but a letter full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is in between," explained the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I saw in one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerrillas live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down because beside him on the bed was a MGL-pomegrower, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I said," "" "Hello, what are you doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter someone has written to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "never before in my life someone wrote me something like that, so I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, was tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this warrior, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC was the only way to save him and his six brothers from starvation. "I never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside which is waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I have learned only how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">But now where there is peace, I can learn many things and work in dignity. "</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the outset, students and some of the leaders of the FARC came together to form a discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as already war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how the social injustice on the part of the state labored on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">To hear those people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated, even people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is painful to me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that after disarming peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, healthcare and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to weapons, to stand up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC are now relying on peace, a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all the defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">There will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but nothing hurt me.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long will you honor the family, you shame?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the last analysis in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started shouting.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wings were you laid - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is still my male name on it, but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">For this I am very grateful to him.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he was respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They demanded to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said to me that I must prove it by going up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say that I didn't change my sex, that everything was just bad news, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have body size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once spoke my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman but you must disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she put a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved her.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, a car with a darkened window panes and a plate of 95cm stood under the window.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time, it became clear to me that something was lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked out the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons, I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With their help I left the country, but then something unbelievable happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering myself, without notice, without knowing everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it in the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message: "don't you think you were safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people know in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">"" "just to prove it to you: it is the number 115." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC media: do you still have contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: just with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo theme.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish I can't overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I actually struggle to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who has eaten in argun one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during the Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">So I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced through blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there are not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to turn to Kadyrow's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say," "" "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked some village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, they were specifically immersed in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people in this prison have disappeared after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken with him.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they have not been presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "nontraditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think, already before 2003, I was already known throughout Grosny when I still lived there - and I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously, seriously!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was applied, I had never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia originally intended to introduce us to the" "" "civilisation" "", "but finally dumped us back to the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubes and shorts.</seg>
<seg id="2354">"" "" "" "the Ministry of Health of Sharia has never curbed me one hair either." ""</seg>
<seg id="2355">Before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several banks stood and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "there is a saying in the Chechen language: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never hunted, and never beaten.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he became Prime Minister in 2005, he began to speak about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, one could feel how people began to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel the situation in the Republic deteriorated steadily.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what action are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a sort of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacups, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I apapperated influenza.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens who want to make you white with foam in front of your mouth that there are no gays with them.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestans have which, the cabinetinians have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">Here I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during the Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think at Transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a strong increase in suicide since the last few months.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Morengi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahrazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and wish to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had detonated himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people managed to extinguish the flames again, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani Hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could no longer do anything.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly thereafter.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahrazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - started.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family patriarchs who felt helpless and incapable of feeding their families and pursuing a safe work due to the persecution of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to make a living.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy acquired power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable lands for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of that wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often the victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and privations.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi-Arabs jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas to the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are surrounded.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused in the region by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawzi subjects now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who were looking for a job completed primary school, 55% finished secondary school leaving a university degree of 45%.</seg>

<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist with residence in London, told Global Voices that the present situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racist ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi.</seg>
<seg id="2423">The reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians newly arriving in Ahwaz and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since functionaries and institutions do not pretend to hire Arab workers, local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to compel them to earn their livelihood outside their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their names and surnames in order to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahrazi, human rights defenders attack alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is intreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, also with the intersectionalism?"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - react with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me, why I should be a feminist and why we should be all feminists in general.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, women nowadays still earn less money than men despite the same education.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women come to a glass ceiling sooner or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender still moves across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple among them.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet, if I come to terms of skin color, racism, black cis women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; when I mention the way we have always been abused physically, emotionally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to hold their silence.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices" and "Kumbaya, my Lord" to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to argue that in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalized form of racial violence that we are subjected to in two ways black women.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as a white girl due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of all skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, I can not join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to consider inequalities in her mind, which refer both to sex and to the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sojourner complained in her speech in 1851: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical point of view a bad and marginalized nature.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women to suggest the importance of overlap of skin colour and gender. some of them will continue to silence the importance of black women for the feminist movement Totals, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional Feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the movement of Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than setting myself up for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of the book Africana womanism: Reclaiming (example: Africa-Womanism: how we reconquer ourselves) speaks of being able to defend ourselves by defining our own way. and not only that - black women can thus be worshipped in this way also the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures, as I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and my being as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can blossom in an environment in which my life is neither bypassed nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be put to the files, but they couldn't do more.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman Balbuena was indicted for abuse, Ada Báez's suspicious announcement was useless.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman returned her ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women are ever refusing to report, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence have to report to the prosecution authorities at all.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Ems, a social science research institute in Paraguay. "there are various indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarmingly.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. this should be regretted forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychic force on her part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most serious:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would become a victim of abuse once.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it earlier, I always thought that it only happens to women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and did not leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of mistreatment would at least have a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreating her.</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you"), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything began with mental ill-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria's adverts with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, they received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">It led a process against its former partner, who developed into an unenforceable legal battle between Paraguay and her native country, in which it mainly concerned money, power and influence of its former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NiUnaMenos (# Unless) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law envisages that Femizid should be declared an independent criminal offense and punish harsher as it is the case in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the wording of the law has been changed in some ways in order to also win the deputies for the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is banned, currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years in prison.</seg>

<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial means for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, maltreatment is seen as part of inter-human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place, so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal.</seg>

<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the bill was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>

<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detention of journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the omanic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment to research these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Second, the research conducted by African scientists will help build up their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, when the AIDS epidemic showed first serious implications for national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before deciding to go back home to support the samba health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about the misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">Disclaimer: Dr. Warrier speaks as a private person.</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: currently the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samba national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no fundamental research here. we only focus on solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain receivers instead of being self-creators.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>

<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the US and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently well.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because funding and development opportunities are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: what is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not comply with standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already an interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GV: how large is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa compared to Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: often it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here.</seg>

<seg id="2628">This contribution by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that covers solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salads since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">His company offers 114 varieties, such as Outstanding Gorgeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only through its own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 it remarked that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents tend not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or caps. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate exponent of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding salad, but meanwhile it takes longer, because his work is increasingly complicated by ever increasing restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to shrink." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">So we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition, "he says." I think that these patents go too far on salads.</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand trial, no one can breed a new salad type, because all the features are already patented. "he continues to do as good as possible and tries to extract the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is growing in the USA and all over the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"" "astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tube salad of the variety Outstanding Gorgeous in the" "" "glasshouse" "" "of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space." ""</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">In the context of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can bind themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">"open source" breeders only allow others who buy seeds to breed them, to breed their own varieties, and not to cut it straight away - two aspects which are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patrons.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants is both important for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seeds play a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg says that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not work with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All species of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grains, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to reach our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over seeds," the recent examples are the amalgamation of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer. "whoever is offered good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables, should also know that the way in which this vegetables are grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making their seeds available free of charge, as opposed to patented seed and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available gene pool due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material that is thus always available is unceasing to shrink.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all of the carton characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">There are still no such estimates for other plants, but experts such as Luby suspect that mass-grown plants such as wheat are still patented as lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are cultivated in such a way that they have specific desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaducto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to maintaining genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It contradicts, however, that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant variations foster innovation." a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection therefore does not prevent innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees the other: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to grow crops that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you have already lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should continue to remain: "independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make work easier for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">In total, Morton is interfering with the concept of patented plant characteristics: "we don't really create the characteristics themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as breeders we have no idea how plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "if you breed a variety, you also breed its own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with great courtyards and monocultures, are required for their cultivation of mass herbicides, breeding in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such who move on international markets but are smaller than Monsanto), the majority of smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they refuse to patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton seeks out salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders by avoiding plant patents would be more innovative: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I constantly need new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in the "open source" breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them breed new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">"" "it also supports them to come to" "" "Open Source" "" "seeds and sell their own." ""</seg>
<seg id="2686">The German Association Agrecol is working on an open-source license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the latest targets of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 5 August, the Egyptian government closed the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information website (ANHRI) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities were sharply criticised and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world, to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it has never been as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered to be the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, for example the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of site blocking to the victim fell. @ anhri one of the main data sources of human rights in Arab language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of columnists and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no longer access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of articles and articles which he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he directed to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government, became the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which the blog is located, is still accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported about the student protests and recorded a video about how the police practiced physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what it means to him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">To lock blogs is very old but in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi priority; and even if the blogging of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) It has succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege; An arrest, an attempted murder, an invitation to the National Security Council, the blocking of blogs as well as any other website for which I was working.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) They have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post items to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Now, however, after they have locked it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked their websites from 24 May to 6 August. this resulted in technical tests on the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of vendors, which was possible by transferring internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that Egyptian users may have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the situation is additionally worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can act against these acts." ""</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go to censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil describe with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro," "thieves robbing pharmacy with military weapons," "President Timer sends 8,500 soldiers of the army, navy and airfarafee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio achieved the highest status in Rio for 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian Non-Governmental Organization Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the editorial" "" "Extra" "" "published for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced to set up a new section called" "" "War in Rio." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city on the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything that deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: that is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four minute video sharing on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper announced that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ruin in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes more:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourses, if distorted, can also be used to cover the atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" damage more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues that violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to punish those responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as indicated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-pleasing neglect of public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">As a reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is larger than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando Frazão / Agência Brasil. publication with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">Rio de Janeiro as "the most violent place in Brazil," according to Cecília, is wrong: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics of 2015 in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most recent available data.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "if we look at the Mordrites per state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is owned by Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília points out, has been repeating the state's security policy for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">This security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by using a massive police custody and permanently stationing one unit.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually resulted in a decrease of violent deaths. but after several years the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of harassment and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux cited one of his articles from 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not match the criteria set out by the Geneva Convention for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also has serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and routes that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civil war is a sharp point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "irrational balls."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">A week later, the police cleared the mountain with Favela Jacarzinho in order to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident was headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to Siege Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organisation PAX and the Syria Institute research institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and Umland, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region of Eastern Ghouta, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been perpetrated.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas outside Damascus have stood under siege, leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points smuggled food.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Thanks to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian assistants and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the common foods in Syria and are extremely rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The right of the project, Abo Nabil, said to AFP, the French news agency:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate fungi, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years it has been fighting to make known this project and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more publicity. "</seg>
<seg id="2814">To raise funds for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is used in consultation with the NGO Ghira Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families of knowledge about planting mushrooms, so Dr. Leila leads to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to raise funds to Cando until Monday, 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced plastics are used from plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began" "" "production of mushrooms from the regions" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>

<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many neighbourhoods in Portugal on 21 October and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that raced in the North of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and some 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government issued a national agreement last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 volcanic eruptions that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European Forest Monitoring System, which monitors the forest areas by satellite images, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of slightly inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, continue to spread to fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the civil protection of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when residents looked for information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it uses the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial in this fateful weekend in October that the servers could not resist the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf was found again in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal pit. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself, in order to earn his living.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran were characterized by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," recalls Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked.</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows, so that we didn't freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without official papers in Iran and was ready for the trip to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf returned to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time ago, Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed meals to people in need twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high twin ratios, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers. however, it is also true that the conditions that asylum seekers in the country find are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes, the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in more than 3000" "" "special reception centres." "" "they are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And so did Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unbridled manner of living helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked for several years in the construction industry, Asharaf set up his entire savings in the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food bar.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind Venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">A lot of bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to unofficial estimates, some 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans run business, including dressmaking, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells of the different Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2919">The Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome also have Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashark's objectives extend far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and the retail trade and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for peasants from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">"" "he also forges plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "so they can sell their crop surpluses on the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but at the end there is stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">He has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans in this way.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the evacuation of the camp Raba'a el Adavya in Cairo, protesting against the decomposition of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo from @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament has reviewed a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months of the successful legal decision on the authority's website stating their full name and identity number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who failed this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or the removal of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The Act, which was applied by 60 members of Parliament, is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, a further MP submitted a legislative proposal to introduce stricter sanctions for the insult of the president or a high officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under the law, however, such an act would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy would be punished.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "moreover, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years anyway." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who was captured on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian policemen while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the impeachment of elected president Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Like more than 700 contestants who had been arrested during the same incident, Shawkan waited four years in jail for a trial date.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to the 20th of May, because the prison management, according to human rights groups, failed to bring the defendant from prison to the courtroom.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan faces death penalty on account of one, so many human rights groups agree on, including weapons possession, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal tribunal in Giza was acquitted by the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their reporting to the pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adawiya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested at the previously mentioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Interrogating Tunisian activists to scanned documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was mainly interrogated to a broken action plan. said plan comes from the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supports a controversial draft bill, which would guarantee business people and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali who accused corruption of amnesty if they return all the illegally received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on the website of Nawaat on 21 April sheds light on how presidential plans are to support the bill.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia refused to nominate his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In spite of this, he appeared as a witness in the District Court in Tunis on May 9th.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to present their badges?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to the new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China need approval before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the regulations that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts suggest that this will enable the elimination of anonymous comments within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these provisions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only selectively in order to protect citizen journalism and its independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscommnadzor, WeChat failed to register with the state government as the" "" "Organisator of Information Dissemination" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a law dated 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of the information. the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force it on request for the termination of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include websites such as Vkontakte and Odnoclassniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>

<seg id="2968">Once this week, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that Internet service providers would compel to monitor communications in real time and install backdoor applications that encrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecoms companies and intelligence agencies regarding the proposal, but has left other technology companies and civilian populations outside.</seg>
