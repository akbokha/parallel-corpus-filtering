that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before someone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly published that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA delivered to Iran literally dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has identified Ris@@ en and urged him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to use this right if media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the courageous ones they are giving .
so when the government was kno@@ cking at Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous repor@@ ters had already done before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , Ris@@ en lived in prison with the risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , despite years of indications that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped on ris@@ ers .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide more and less .
instead of failure and breaking up Ris@@ en , that could also be done by his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , kept his telep@@ hon@@ y secretly concerned ,
just like its e @-@ mail data , finance and banking information , its credit information , and even travel documents with the list of its flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en &apos;s supposed source .
unfortunately this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his arrival , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary was more do@@ omed than all U.S. governments met before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional additive , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do so from the moment they contact , rather than in hin@@ d@@ sight , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software , which has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written its book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls .
one such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source release system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet fame , the former Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now being developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the one here of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government cannot secretly proc@@ ure information , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
but Secure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that thre@@ aten us all .
it is important to us that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have an opportunity to give away mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the supply of soldiers and wants to report about crowded hospitals . or the next environmental employee who calls for an alarm to the contaminated water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warns us of the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers come to companies like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages as the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a trace of US $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent ri@@ ll@@ ers or a John Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be weeping away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this be possible for us ?
but the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
all over the world , media and leading politicians are discussing how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these il@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the USA . &quot; &quot; &quot;
probably because there have been no prominent Americans who came up with this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
now it is not that there are not enough Americans to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but due to the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less ameri@@ can customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA .
in fact , in some U.S. states , less information is needed , less information has to be given to establish a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees from school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed frau@@ d@@ sters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this in practice looks like .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
we really shocked all of us that everyone except one lawyer would make suggestions on how to transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anyone . however , it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted suggestions to our hidden investig@@ ator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single leader politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game .
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult .
this may sound very comfor@@ ting as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some things have started to change .
over the past few years , we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has been gathering in central registers on a national level , who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally .
for us with Global Wit@@ ness , this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us companies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this type of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency which is now allowing this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing to end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I was almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after finishing my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sales .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da remained standing and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me excit@@ edly about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought : &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just met him first ! he says he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small luggage compartment !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard myself saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ h , how do you please ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I was lying in bed , I gaz@@ ed at the ceiling and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in there ?
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of the bed at ti@@ the tips to the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me is now hanging in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s make a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate attracts and the rent increases .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can make it transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we created a website and created such &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; air matt@@ resses and breakfast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air matt@@ resses .
they thought it was great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese hams &apos; om@@ el@@ ettes tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we said good@@ bye to our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we were at the same time finding new friends and paying our rent ?
things were rolling .
my former mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when a visit comes over .
over the internet , they can then invite wild strangers to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in sol@@ ace would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we have learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you have to concentrate on the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we strive for .
it &apos;s a 30 second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone in your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked mobile phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the locked cell phone in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
so most guests feel like they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone now ?
could you tell Twitter that he is chann@@ eling for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to share with you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor would have presented himself with his name ? if he had told him from where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you have 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really keep well locked mobil@@ es ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
this is because a well @-@ thought out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning , we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to surrender negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest left their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they are in terms of age and place of residence .
we trust the people most that are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it is exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation encourages simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you spend on yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted either . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimum level of openness , e.g. &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! I make holiday with my family . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text box to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first , incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been met before .
the business is running very well for us .
of course there are times when not everything runs smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked with our customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million observed overnight stays had a problem .
for men have confidence in one another .
if trust works , something wonderful can emerge .
one of our guests made a holiday in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
of course , every stay does not exp@@ ire .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what one wants to achieve with the Share economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not just the case . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people are sharing a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group of residents would wait to complete a thorough and show one at a pub tour of which one has never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in the South Korean capital of Seoul , the project has already begun . lots of parking places belonging to the government ,
students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were taught to people whose children were withdrawn .
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be guest at a stranger or even host tonight .
the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re @-@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why has ours just worked ?
apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted stere@@ otypes .
I find that start@@ ling ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use for design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay at the airport security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ ch myself .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I chose the hi@@ j@@ ab to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was that at that time , it was a feminist declaration of independence , in comparison to the pressure I felt as a 17 year old , adapting myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only accepted passive faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I later , after my marriage , had a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking out . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bec@@ ome a Mek@@ ka ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start a post@@ graduate course .
I remember how I felt -- when we drove sil@@ ently -- as deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I feared to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be vig@@ il@@ ant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ove not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged down and struck .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put the anger of people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually say people say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumour is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is false .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympic champi@@ ons .
will the closing of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
it might stop a few parking spaces , but don &apos;t stop the terror .
the regular attendance of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater citizen participation .
and as a head of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised into mos@@ ques .
they are radi@@ cal@@ ised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
the radi@@ cal@@ isation process has seen that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that causes the person to be terrorists , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen by faith .
if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop people going to the mos@@ que .
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS bases its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would fit into their imagination by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam , like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when one looks at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had planned to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she had spoken brought her to silence and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that could make sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m re@@ established the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian regime , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when people submit messages in which negative stories were reported about Muslims , they would rather agree to military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not just a academic problem .
if you see when the mood against Muslims came up -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two periods of elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public in order to hollow out the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well @-@ informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all .
with the allocation of collective guilt it is not just about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school .
De@@ ah was an ath@@ lete .
he was talented , promising , at the dental university ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was ba@@ ff@@ led and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when did such an accomplished young man become of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who visited Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay at home safely ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to entr@@ ust to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled my shoes off , went into the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembly was Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us .
at this moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had preferred courage and compassion for panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go safe ?
or will you join those who think that we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a pos@@ h think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when you look at the Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so I am not an exception in any way .
when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a bas@@ tion platform is about to become a billion dollar business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before air @-@ package distribution penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six @-@ metre @-@ high tower of 1,@@ 500 bricks in front of the public . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight units , aircraft reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space .
you can also build self @-@ winding structures .
they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and in general react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possible in the autonomous flight .
in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the space .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flying machine trying to hit two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star wings , it can float , and therefore has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of stern star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that no matter what position , the aircraft can regain the optimum position and improve performance by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions which advance to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that gather to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flying units , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with just one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ a , the mechanically easiest remotely operated flight unit . it was invented a short time ago .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bars , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only a prop@@ eller .
although it is a mechanical impulse , there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant rear @-@ star@@ ters algorithm . to get it flying , I have to throw it exactly right .
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of throwing it right when all is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night .
if the winner is an exercise in pleas@@ ant@@ ness , this machine is here , the bus with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in this way he receives the au@@ ti@@ di@@ ous ability ,
moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even rotating .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly while flying .
let &apos;s look at this .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when one builds them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit restricted .
we will demonstrate this by making one half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration studies synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took commercially available Micro Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe press da drü@@ ben wants to become a flying shade @-@ screen at Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
for guys like us , wages are in development and creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that creative , clever creatures are allowed to form them in so spectacular fashion .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes revol@@ ved around each other in a very far away gal@@ axy ; they turned the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they lit up bri@@ ghter than all stars together in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not set them free in the form of light --
finally , we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
at first we arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life had just ar@@ isen on Earth .
since then the earth has produced quite a few things : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves that are formed by col@@ li@@ ding black holes .
most considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy genius , so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser @-@ Interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory .
in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of lig@@ o increased significantly , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the commissioning of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes dri@@ fted through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my daughter
and the good@@ bye to my father sick father .
in essence , these were the fruits of my life &apos;s work .
all that I worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : that &apos;s my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and their signals through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ?
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a mu@@ til@@ ation in the structure of space and time .
by moving the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pun@@ ched into the other .
for illustr@@ ative purposes , lec@@ turers often perform a really sil@@ ly dance in courses of rel@@ ativity theory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and compressed when the waves were hit . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by a 1 .
with a five kilometre long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured at less than one thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classical text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite practical , because so you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
in the case of sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult to make a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
your child &apos;s face , for instance .
instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume in order to close the story behind it .
&apos;@@ now just says Alice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and Bob breaks them down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so if we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak .
listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been working very long .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ ping : w@@ up@@ p !
turning the two bodies very quickly , you hear the same p@@ ant@@ y with an additional key change . that sounds like this : wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , engraved in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render noise &#93; No one who knows what to listen to , acknow@@ le@@ dges this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass that rotate around as fast as the bars of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve a hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
this consists of the permanent importance of lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o opens a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we cannot see -- practically or basically -- not .
a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ice stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as .
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen in the nucle@@ us , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through as these are op@@ ak .
gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it , since the Big B@@ ang is hidden by its own reflection .
with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and most importantly , I am optim@@ istic that there are things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches it , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sour cher@@ no@@ ds for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the formation of the stars , and ultimately on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories - a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; Yes . &quot;
did I want to speak in public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start with the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , brush@@ ing away my fear .
my fear of holding speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed my life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way . it started with a question of my youngest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest one , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I need milk for my be@@ ak . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new attitude towards life in my family . from then on I swear to always play with them as soon as you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I am going , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very ti@@ ring .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think of things , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
I &apos;m doing TV , in a grand style .
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program out into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
each program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts , simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself and not just produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp fire and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , therefore I am a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , that all of you who work so hard whether you are running a company , a country or a classroom , take a business or a household , take me seriously , so you understand that I &apos;m not just typing on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it is true when I say : I understand that there is nothing to dream about in a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set troops as if I painted on a canvas .
as if you have a high sound , run a marathon .
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love working .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go on it forever .
many people assume when I explain to them the sums that I am talking about writing that writing is joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does .
but the sum@@ ming -- when I began with television production , when I began to work and work and work , build , create , and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy .
the sum is more than writing .
bu@@ zz@@ ing is action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the tot@@ em is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz , then you can &apos;t asp@@ ire differently than by size .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size no matter what price .
this is called sum@@ ming .
or perhaps it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it &apos;s a genius .
perhaps it is ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I know only that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make one thing clear : the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations are .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon that I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als .
I like this h@@ um . I love the h@@ um .
I need the sum . I am the sum .
am I only this sum ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ laid , burnt out .
the sum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their m@@ um is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sch@@ ätz@@ chen , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I did not love my work any more . the engine was off .
the bu@@ zz did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan never sleeps , does not give up , with all heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showcase Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no more fun .
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do is the work you love , suddenly fade ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ ail yourself , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do it , you do it , you do it , you love what you do , being a teacher , being a teacher , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives one the bu@@ zz when you know the h@@ um once you &apos;ve known the bu@@ zz , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m on the way out late , late and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone any more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when did this happen ?
I hate it when I &apos;m a titanium and my bu@@ zz goes down , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we play and her sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dramatically . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of the amount , I can do nothing but watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something inside me solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the h@@ um slowly comes back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s silent , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the sums , but a bu@@ zz .
and now I feel as if I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the cause .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the sums , the sums of work , the titanium @-@ sum , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using broad@@ casts and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the sums are not a force and it is not work @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the stream that comes from the jo@@ ie de vi@@ vre .
the real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be completed , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a titanium ?
it is just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
playing is not a good idea how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what one person rather works than to be at home ?
well , yes , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of that .
we ra@@ ve around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst ballo@@ ons .
in doing so I feel overwhel@@ m@@ ingly stiff , absent and confused .
I always use my mobile phone .
but it is ok .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? you &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ä@@ fer or cookie replaced me .
and when my teen@@ age daughter speaks with me for a whole 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it anymore .
everyone can take up 15 minutes a day , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a piece !
no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to go .
but 15 minutes are possible !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it is not necessary to be the children . it is necessary to feel the tot@@ em , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what &apos;s good for you .
find out and keep it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I win and I win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a bit , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sum seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . it leads me to new ideas .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the sum , the sums it is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
that is my tot@@ um now .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ als of love .
the bu@@ zz of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful for that .
it is s@@ wir@@ ling to me that I am a titanium . I have never seen a Titan playing the trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and to more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires still burn .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the country I created , the marathon that I run , the troops , the screens , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the other , the correct sums : the tot@@ als of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , bare and new feeling of being in me is wide . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I am author . I think of things , I raise you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
that &apos;s the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and to more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to the other after a severe stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , in contrast to other body organs , has a very low capacity for self @-@ healing .
after a serious injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they have probably heard of one of the best known , the &quot; brain stimulation . &quot; an electrode is im@@ planted in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circu@@ it@@ ry in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they must imagine that skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas inc@@ ur the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
to save life , it is necessary to reduce cran@@ ial pressure .
to do this , sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
being able to grow cells from a tissue is comparable to very small children that are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environment to make it prosp@@ er .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it was Jean @-@ François .
he saw it under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked just like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , im@@ mature cells .
perhaps you still know from biology lessons that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they shared slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they are responsible for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries .
but this is not so safe .
one thing , however , is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ language area and then cultivate the cells just as it did by Jean @-@ François .
and then select colour in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we made them at the close of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- au@@ tot@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ use these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ use the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that they disappeared completely after a few weeks as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ated exactly the same cells , and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were reim@@ plant@@ able .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys using a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tray .
they did it very well .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it happened in humans , they spontaneously recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , as well as monkeys .
when we were sure that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left , they see the monkey who spontaneously recovered .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that were very exciting results for us too .
since then , we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to implant them in humans .
I really hope to show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can need it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans .
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill approximately two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first of all , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the agency allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply it to a multi@@ center study .
you first have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West are making a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable .
we believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs realized in Greece .
at that moment I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ umb to an error , we could save the democracy but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ able democracy .
for without democracy , our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future dark and our great new technologies are wasted .
on the subject of extravag@@ ance , I would like to point out to you an interesting contradiction which is currently under threat to our economies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognise the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unused cash , which , however , is too timi@@ d to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could contribute to the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , in all the prosperity @-@ producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , rails , equipment and so on and so forth .
3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money , compared to the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time were lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise the real estate prices .
thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that do not compensate for the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe working unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand that fears the pes@@ si@@ mis@@ m of investors as in an endless loop that it could be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
un@@ intentionally cause the circumstances that cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; &quot; &quot; his extremely lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies that are decisive for the saving of the earth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy naturally ended too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
it would be a mistake , however , to reduce the significance of the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy as a result of these exclusion .
the decisive factor in the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it interfer@@ ed with the toil@@ ing poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which allowed them to grant them the right to political participation with the same mood in question of the state &apos;s affairs .
Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle , which shines brigh@@ tly , it is burned out quickly .
however , today liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magn@@ a Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a by@@ word for rulers .
the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- that is , the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our present @-@ day demo@@ cra@@ cies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , as the economy slowly under@@ mines policy and dis@@ em@@ powers it .
do you wonder why the politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and not in power , because the power from politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is roughly the same as a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals they feed on , so that they star@@ ve at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has become so ramp@@ ant in politics that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ caused economic crisis . the power of the corporations is increasing , political goods are de@@ valued , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism distri@@ butes the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ unite politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demo@@ s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it did not go out very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working arms regain a position just as in ancient Athens , without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working arms !
capitalism is doing it by replacing low wage workers with automation and robots .
the problem with this is that as long economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks become higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts lower , as it is -- already very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we need to resh@@ ape the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological surveillance hyp@@ e @-@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film ‹ matrix › seem like a documentary .
the question is therefore not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something that the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; resembles , in which machines serve human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks dev@@ our@@ ing the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it take to look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to briefly mention some examples .
in the field of companies : please introduce a capital market in which you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all income comes from capital and from redemption and the concept of wage labour is completely obsol@@ ete .
no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises , but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but who do not belong there . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy : please let us briefly suggest that our national currencies would have a freely oscill@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets &#93; , in the interest of all of humanity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in units of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cosmos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine that this fund is investing in green technologies , particularly in parts of the world where investment funds are rare .
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time one did not have the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , in particular against the background of a re @-@ unified politics and economy .
the world I describe is at the same time secretary in which she pre@@ fers privileged individuals , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because she will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage b@@ ins of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all , it is a world in which we can imagine real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically .
it is in our hands and we do it better democr@@ atically .
thank you .
Bruno Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers den@@ otes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant ,
like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am also perfect .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very gre@@ ek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have very clearly stated what you think of the West &apos;s view to China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays , -- the area of economy -- is a fully democratic zone .
in a certain sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -
he was very skep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what can now be observed in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now pre@@ throwing to do what the West has done for itself in the nineteenth century smells great after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later in the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone ,
not only Greece but the euro zone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; namely saying good@@ bye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous den@@ ial that a massive throw @-@ away line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be massi@@ vely threatened by the development of the entire European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continued to den@@ ounce den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if one tries to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it may be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future unless we change its construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone looking back -- Seri@@ ously ...
if there is a minister of finance or any minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for an extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I thought that there was an honest interest on the sponsors pages to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that were running through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been running a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for five years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the Troika of the credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us was saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if it does not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it seems to me it will be just as det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you that you were with TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
of Roy Price most people have never heard even though he is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ hair@@ style and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movies , TV , technique , tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t select any one .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he must find shows that are quite right on this corner .
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating is from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this rating is received .
if your show is rated at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after looking at a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy Price is not about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence to under@@ line &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the average pay@@ back , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire .
so he must make sure he &apos;s really on the right side .
the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything .
he wants to create successes .
he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight Candi@@ dates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them free of charge .
and if Amazon prints out things for nothing , you get too , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
you record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you ski@@ pped or looking at again .
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them , and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team were working towards .
about at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a little different .
instead of holding a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows their course , which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com for four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; house of Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now the question is : what happened here ?
you have two very competitive , data @-@ sav@@ vy companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic says somehow that this should work for everything .
if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision .
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it with very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work , it is a bit sc@@ ary because we are living in a time where we are taking more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television .
do you know the multi @-@ health system ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in jail .
if someone is in jail here in the US and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is made or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding if a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , it can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always producing the best results . that &apos;s not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that by analy@@ zing data analysis , it could predict out@@ breaks of flu , the bad way - by analy@@ zing Google &apos;s research .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and nobody could say why .
it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies like Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data streams into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ ai@@ ded genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , you dis@@ assemble this problem into its components , so that you can analyze the individual parts ; as a branch , put the individual parts together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
for that there is another tool and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is pieces and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been able to do . but deciding how to take all these parts together and make a show like House of Cards is not in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when competing for TV ideas , then choosing &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we tell us the dates . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data are helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to ste@@ er our decisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will fight it later with a technical demo .
so far I &apos;ve made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you want to replace them with a little more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not change the basic structure .
in the end , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right curve .
and I feel this very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays out to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
